Control is gradually relaxed over weeks 3-8 to balance economic and social needs while monitoring epidemic trends, then slightly reinforced towards the end of the period to prevent rebound infections. Lower fractions in early weeks correspond to stricter control, especially from states with higher infection prevalence relative to their populations. Total flow is maintained by redistributing traffic over the 10 weeks."
