  "global_guidance": "The policy focuses on stronger traffic control in the first 3 weeks for high inflow and higher infection origin states like Texas and Virginia to curtail disease spread early. Arizona and New Mexico have lower inflows and infection rates, so controls remain moderate and steady. The latter weeks allow gradual relaxation to resume mobility while monitoring disease trends, with slight increases in control near the end to prevent resurgence. This balanced approach aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Mississippi while maintaining overall travel volume."
