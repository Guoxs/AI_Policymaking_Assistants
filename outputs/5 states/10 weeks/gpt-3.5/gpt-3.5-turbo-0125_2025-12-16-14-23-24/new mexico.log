  "global_guidance": "Given the SEIRD parameters and current infection levels, especially in Texas and Arizona, stricter traffic control is prioritized in the first 3-4 weeks to reduce inbound infectious cases. Gradual relaxation follows to maintain total flow while minimizing transmission risk. Mississippi's high exposed and infected rates warrant strong early restrictions despite low inflow. Virginia's lower inflow and moderate infections allow for milder controls. This balanced approach helps minimize cumulative cases and deaths while preserving essential mobility."
