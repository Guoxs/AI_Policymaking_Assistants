The largest inflow from Texas requires the most stringent early control. Moderate initial restrictions from other states balance control and economic factors. Gradual relaxation after week 5 allows adaptation to epidemic trends while maintaining overall flow volume, thus minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases."
