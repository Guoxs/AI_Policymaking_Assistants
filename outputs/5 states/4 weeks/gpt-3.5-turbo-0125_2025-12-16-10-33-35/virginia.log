  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocation strategies collectively aim to minimize imported infection risk while preserving essential mobility flows into Virginia. States with higher infection prevalence or larger infected populations relative to their size, such as Mississippi, adopt strict-first-then-relaxed strategies (S1), reducing infection introduction during the critical early weeks. States with lower prevalence and smaller daily inflows, such as New Mexico, are assigned a more relaxed mid-relaxed strategy (S5) to maintain economic and social mobility with minimal epidemic risk. This coordinated approach leverages temporal heterogeneity in control intensity, concentrating strict measures early when importation risk is highest and loosening later to recover mobility benefits. Quantitatively, imported infections are proportional to inbound flow, infection prevalence (I/pop), and fraction of allowed mobility (ft). By front-loading strict control for high-risk states and allowing more relaxed patterns for low-risk states, the cumulative imported infections and subsequent secondary cases in Virginia are minimized. Sensitivity to parameters like beta (transmission rate) and prevalence indicates that if these rise, stricter or prolonged controls may be necessary. Conversely, lower prevalence or reduced beta could justify more relaxed or uniform strategies. Overall, this balanced policy framework supports epidemic risk reduction in Virginia without unduly restricting critical mobility and economic functions across states."

The average daily inflow into Virginia from Arizona is high (5765.86), which poses a non-negligible risk of importing infections. Quantitatively, the expected imported infected individuals scale with inflow * fraction * (I / total population). Given Arizona's moderate prevalence, a stricter control early on (S1 pattern) reduces initial risk, allowing more relaxed measures as the situation potentially improves or Virginia's local control strengthens.

Coupled with an inbound flow of 5541.81 into Virginia, this represents a significant importation risk. The imported infected estimate (flow * fraction * I/pop) is therefore non-trivial. Choosing a strict-first-then-relaxed strategy (S1) for Mississippi is epidemiologically justified to sharply reduce imported infections in the initial weeks when risk is greatest, thereby protecting Virginia's epidemic trajectory.

Applying the strict-first-then-relaxed strategy (S1) mitigates early importation risk by limiting inflow fractions when infections are relatively high, then gradually relaxing controls to balance mobility needs over time.

This reduces the immediate risk of importing infections that could seed new outbreaks in Virginia. For New Mexico, with low prevalence and smaller flow, a more relaxed, mid-distributed strategy balances mobility and risk appropriately. The underlying logic uses the formula: imported infections ¡Ö flow * fraction * (I/pop), focusing on reducing fractions when I/pop is high and flow is large. By staggering strictness early and relaxing later, the policy allows gradual resumption of essential mobility while minimizing cumulative imported cases and deaths. Sensitivity to changes in prevalence or transmission rate (beta) indicates that if prevalence rises or beta increases, stricter early controls become even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence falls, relaxation can be accelerated. Coordination across states ensures that Virginia's epidemic curve is less likely to be impacted by external seeding events, preserving healthcare capacity and public health gains."
