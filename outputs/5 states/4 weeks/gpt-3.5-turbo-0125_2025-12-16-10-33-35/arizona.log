The inflow to Arizona averages 1920.29 daily, potentially importing infected individuals proportional to flow * fraction * (I/pop). Given this moderate infection prevalence and moderate daily inflow, a strict-first-then-relaxed strategy (S1) is optimal. Early weeks with lower fractions strongly limit importation of infections, reducing initial epidemic seeding risk in Arizona.

Combined with a relatively moderate inbound flow into Arizona (~2444 daily), the risk of importing infections is significant. Calculating imported infections as Flow * ft * (I/pop), the strategy emphasizes stricter controls early (low fractions initially) to reduce immediate risk. This mitigates the initial surge in imported cases while progressively relaxing restrictions to allow some mobility recovery. This approach balances the need to protect Arizona's population from sudden imported outbreaks while recognizing the economic and social importance of maintaining some flow. The gradual relaxation also aligns with potential improvements in Mississippi's epidemic status or Arizona's capacity to manage incoming cases."

The average daily inflow from Mississippi into Arizona is moderate (2743.86). Using the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/pop), the infection import risk is significant, especially in early weeks. Therefore, a strict-first approach (S1) is justified to minimize initial importation of infections when prevalence is high, then gradually relaxing controls as the situation potentially improves. This strategy balances epidemic risk by strongly limiting early inflow fractions, reducing the initial seeding of infections in Arizona, while allowing more mobility later to preserve economic and essential activities. The trade-off is cautious restriction upfront to prevent overwhelming Arizona's healthcare system, followed by measured liberalization."

Hence, the mid-strict strategy (S4) with moderately strict controls in weeks 2 and 3 and higher restrictions at start and end is chosen.

The exposed (E=35966) and confirmed (Q=13048) values also suggest ongoing transmission. Given the moderate inflow to Arizona (2284.38 daily), and the significant infection prevalence (I/pop ~0.0025), imported infection risk is non-negligible. The infection-import estimate scales with inflow * fraction * (I/pop). Therefore, a strategy with strict control initially (low fractions in early weeks) can minimize imported infections when risk is high, followed by relaxation as risk potentially reduces or immunity builds. S1_strict_first_then_relaxed is chosen to balance epidemic control with mobility needs. This phased approach reduces early importation while allowing gradual mobility restoration, crucial for economic and social factors. Overall, this strategy addresses the trade-off by front-loading restrictions when risk and imported infections are highest."

Inflow to Arizona from New Mexico is substantial (32016.38 daily), making mobility preservation important for economic and social connectivity. Given the low infection prevalence and high flow, a balanced traffic policy is necessary. The S5_mid_relaxed strategy, which provides moderate restrictions early with some relaxation in mid-weeks, suits this profile. It limits risks without severely impacting high-volume mobility.

Conversely, if local vaccination or immunity improves, mobility can be relaxed more quickly. Continuous monitoring should inform dynamic adjustments to these strategies."
