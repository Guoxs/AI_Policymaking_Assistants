States with higher infection ratios and moderate flows (Mississippi, New Mexico, Virginia) adopt the S1 strict-first-then-relaxed pattern to sharply cut early importation risk, crucial for minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Arizona. Texas, with low infection prevalence but very high flow, uses the S2 relaxed-first-then-strict pattern to maintain essential mobility early while tightening controls later to preempt potential surges. This coordinated approach distributes restrictions temporally and spatially, reducing overall imported infection pressure. Quantitatively, the imported infected cases approximate Flow * ft * (I/pop), so managing ft fractions dynamically per week and origin state optimizes risk reduction. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) rises, stricter early controls become even more critical, while if prevalence decreases, relaxation can be expedited. This framework enables Arizona to minimize epidemic impact while preserving vital economic and social activities through informed, adaptive mobility management."

States with higher infection prevalence relative to their population (New Mexico and Virginia) receive stricter initial controls (S1) to reduce early importation risk, which is critical when infection seeding can exacerbate Mississippi¡¯s epidemic. Arizona, with moderate prevalence, is similarly managed with a strict-first approach to limit early influx. Texas, despite its large mobility flow, has low infection prevalence, allowing a relaxed-first-then-strict strategy (S2) to preserve essential economic and social mobility without significantly increasing risk. This cooperative allocation across states balances epidemic control and mobility by concentrating initial restrictions where risk is highest and allowing gradual relaxation where it is epidemiologically safer. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early controls become more critical to prevent surges. Conversely, if prevalence falls or beta decreases, the system can tolerate more relaxed initial flows, emphasizing the importance of adaptive, data-driven strategies. Overall, this calibrated multi-state approach optimally reduces imported infection pressure on Mississippi while maintaining vital mobility connections.'

Mississippi's low flow and moderate infection prevalence justify a relaxed-first approach, balancing risks and mobility. Quantitatively, imported infected cases are proportional to inbound flow times infected prevalence times control fraction (ft). By frontloading stricter controls, New Mexico reduces early seeding risks when local infection levels (I=1,276) are moderate but vulnerable. Relaxation in later weeks reflects expected epidemic stabilization and economic necessity. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter or longer-lasting controls would be warranted. Conversely, if prevalence declines, relaxation can be accelerated to restore normal mobility. The coordinated approach across origin states leverages heterogeneous risk profiles and flow volumes to optimize epidemic control without unnecessarily compromising essential mobility and economic functions in New Mexico."

Arizona and Virginia, with moderate-to-high infection prevalence and significant daily inflows, are assigned strict-first strategies to immediately reduce importation risk, tapering off as Texas strengthens its internal controls. Mississippi's higher infection prevalence but moderate inflow is managed with a reverse phased strategy, allowing flexibility early on but tightening restrictions to prevent later surges. New Mexico, with the largest inflow and moderate infection levels, is controlled with a mid-strict approach maintaining consistent control intensity to balance risk and mobility. This coordinated multi-state approach reduces cumulative infections and deaths in Texas by minimizing high-risk imports early and allowing adaptive relaxation. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases in any origin, stricter early controls become more critical. Conversely, improvements in Texas' internal parameters (e.g., vaccination, contact reduction) may allow earlier relaxation. This strategy reflects a balance of epidemiological risk, mobility needs, and temporal adaptability to protect public health while sustaining economic and social activities."

This front-loaded approach is critical to limit seeding events that could exacerbate Virginia¡¯s outbreak. For New Mexico, a balanced mid-strict strategy reflects moderate risk and inflow, maintaining consistent but cautious mobility. Texas, with its large inflow but low infection prevalence, benefits from an initially relaxed approach to preserve essential travel and economic activities, tightening restrictions in later weeks to contain potential risks. This combined policy effectively distributes control efforts in time and across states, minimizing cumulative infections and deaths. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter or earlier interventions should be prioritized, especially for higher prevalence origin states, to prevent exacerbation of Virginia¡¯s epidemic. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed strategies could be considered to restore mobility without compromising public health. The chosen patterns reflect a dynamic, data-driven approach balancing epidemic control and mobility needs across this multi-state network.'

States with higher infection prevalence and/or large inflows (Mississippi, Texas, New Mexico) receive stricter early restrictions (S1 or S4), frontloading control efforts when importation risk is highest. This reduces initial seeding of infections in Arizona, allowing local control measures to remain effective. Lower prevalence or lower inflow states (Virginia) use uniform control (S3), balancing risk and mobility without unnecessary burden. Cross-state coordinated restrictions reduce overall imported infections synergistically; for example, strict early weeks on high inflow states reduce total infection pressure, allowing later relaxation and economic recovery. Sensitivity analysis suggests if prevalence increases or transmissibility (beta) rises, stricter or longer-lasting controls would be necessary to maintain control. Conversely, if prevalence falls or vaccination rises, more relaxed strategies could be adopted earlier. This adaptive, data-driven allocation balances epidemic risk with essential mobility, supporting Arizona's health and economy over the next 4 weeks."

This approach reduces the initial seeding risk into Mississippi, which is critical given its current epidemic composition (I=3856, E=8184) and substantial susceptible pool (~2.78 million). Virginia, with a higher infection prevalence but lower flow volume, is assigned a moderate strict strategy (S4_mid_strict) to balance consistent risk mitigation and mobility preservation. Quantitatively, imported infections scale with Flow * ft * (I/pop), so reducing ft early in high-flow or higher-prevalence states minimizes imported cases and consequent deaths. The phased relaxation in S1 for three states aligns with expected epidemic improvements or enhanced testing/contact tracing, allowing economic recovery. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more critical, while lower prevalence or vaccination coverage could justify more relaxed approaches. Coordinated control across origin states reduces the overall risk of outbreak amplification in Mississippi by limiting asynchronous importation peaks and preserving essential movement. This strategy respects epidemiological principles while considering socioeconomic imperatives.'

This approach minimizes the cumulative imported infections by front-loading restrictions when the risk of seeding New Mexico's epidemic is highest, thus reducing the baseline reproductive number (R0) amplification via imported cases. The strict-first strategy for high-risk states reduces the effective imported infected fraction early, allowing New Mexico's local epidemic controls to be more effective. Texas¡¯s mid-relaxed strategy reflects a compromise that acknowledges the economic imperative of mobility with moderate epidemic risk, maintaining essential flows without compromising New Mexico's epidemic control significantly. Quantitatively, this balances the product of flow * fraction * infection prevalence across origin states and weeks to minimize cumulative imported infections and deaths. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase in any origin state, early strict control becomes even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccination coverage improves, gradual relaxation could be accelerated. These policies collectively optimize epidemic control and mobility preservation under current epidemiological conditions, positioning New Mexico to minimize imported infections and consequent morbidity and mortality."

Arizona, Mississippi, and Virginia, all showing moderate to elevated infection and exposed counts relative to their populations, are assigned the strict-first-then-relaxed strategy (S1). This reduces inbound flow significantly in the early weeks when infection import risk is highest, thereby lowering the cumulative imported infected count and subsequent secondary transmission within Texas. Meanwhile, New Mexico, with the lowest infected ratio but the largest mobility volume into Texas, is given the mid-relaxed strategy (S5) to sustain essential economic activities and social mobility while maintaining moderate control. This heterogeneous approach reflects a quantitative balance between infection import risk (flow * fraction * I/pop) and mobility needs. Coordinated across weeks, the front-loading of strict control for high-risk states combined with stable moderate control for low-risk, high-volume states mitigates peak imported infections and smooths demand on Texas's healthcare and control resources. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase in origin states, stricter or more prolonged control (e.g., extending S1 to more weeks or adopting S4 mid-strict) may be warranted to avoid overwhelming Texas's epidemic control capacity. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, relaxing controls earlier may be feasible. This strategy framework is adaptive but prioritizes early containment to minimize cumulative cases and deaths while preserving essential mobility for economic stability."

States with higher infection prevalence or larger infected populations relative to their size, such as Mississippi, adopt strict-first-then-relaxed strategies (S1), reducing infection introduction during the critical early weeks. States with lower prevalence and smaller daily inflows, such as New Mexico, are assigned a more relaxed mid-relaxed strategy (S5) to maintain economic and social mobility with minimal epidemic risk. This coordinated approach leverages temporal heterogeneity in control intensity, concentrating strict measures early when importation risk is highest and loosening later to recover mobility benefits. Quantitatively, imported infections are proportional to inbound flow, infection prevalence (I/pop), and fraction of allowed mobility (ft). By front-loading strict control for high-risk states and allowing more relaxed patterns for low-risk states, the cumulative imported infections and subsequent secondary cases in Virginia are minimized. Sensitivity to parameters like beta (transmission rate) and prevalence indicates that if these rise, stricter or prolonged controls may be necessary. Conversely, lower prevalence or reduced beta could justify more relaxed or uniform strategies. Overall, this balanced policy framework supports epidemic risk reduction in Virginia without unduly restricting critical mobility and economic functions across states.'

High prevalence and/or high flow states (Mississippi, Texas) receive stricter initial controls to prevent early seeding of cases, preserving Arizona's lower infection baseline and reducing potential exponential growth. Lower prevalence states with large mobility (New Mexico) are given relaxed early controls to sustain essential socio-economic activities, with tightening later to hedge against unexpected epidemic increases. Moderate prevalence and flow states (Virginia) adopt a mid-strict approach to balance risk and mobility. This coordinated policy leverages temporal allocation of traffic flows, concentrating restrictions when risk importation is highest and relaxing later to regain mobility, thus optimizing overall epidemic control. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) increases in any origin state, shifting to stricter early controls in that state would be warranted. Conversely, reduced prevalence or enhanced local containment may allow more relaxed allocations. This flexible, data-driven approach ensures Arizona's epidemic control while sustaining vital economic and social connections."

This strategy aggressively limits inbound flow fractions initially, reducing the risk of seeding new infections when Mississippi's own infected population remains high. The subsequent relaxation phases balance epidemic control with socioeconomic mobility needs, allowing gradual restoration of travel and trade. The approach leverages the infection import formula Flow * fraction * (I/pop) to target higher-risk states like Texas with strict early controls, while also applying consistent caution to moderate and low-risk states. Cross-state coordination through a unified strategy simplifies implementation and maximizes infection import reduction by frontloading restrictions. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) increases, the strict-first approach gains further importance to prevent surges. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, the relaxation phases can be accelerated. Overall, this strategy reflects a cautious but adaptive policy optimizing epidemic suppression and essential mobility preservation under Mississippi's current epidemic and inflow conditions."

High-flow states with moderate to high prevalence (Texas, Arizona) receive strict-first strategies to aggressively reduce early importation risk when New Mexico's infection load is moderate, thereby flattening the epidemic curve. Mississippi, despite lower flow, has very high prevalence, so a relaxed-first then stricter approach balances initial mobility needs with later epidemic control as New Mexico's situation evolves. Virginia's low flow and intermediate prevalence justify a mid-relaxed strategy, preserving connectivity while managing risk. Quantitatively, imported infected cases scale as flow * fraction * (I/pop), so strategies target reducing fractions (ft) when risk is greatest. Cooperation across weeks and states reduces overall importation, as stricter early weeks for high-risk states curb early seeding events, while gradual relaxation preserves essential mobility and economic functions. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls would become more imperative, while lower prevalence or beta values could permit more relaxed strategies. This adaptive, heterogeneous approach balances epidemic control and mobility preservation based on origin-specific epidemic and mobility profiles, optimizing New Mexico's public health outcomes over the next 28 days."

States with higher infection rates like Mississippi and moderate ones like Arizona and Virginia are assigned the S1_strict_first_then_relaxed strategy to enforce stricter controls in the early weeks when Texas' epidemic is sensitive, effectively reducing the initial seeding of new cases. In contrast, New Mexico¡¯s low infection prevalence but high flow justifies a more balanced mid-relaxed strategy (S5) to maintain mobility while still mitigating risk. This cross-state cooperation reduces the cumulative expected imported infections, as early strict controls front-load risk reduction when Texas' susceptible population is large, and healthcare capacity is limited. Over the 4 weeks, relaxing controls as infection risks potentially decline balances epidemic control with economic and social needs. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence in any origin state increases or transmission parameters (beta) rise, strict-first strategies become even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence drops or vaccination improves, relaxation can be accelerated without significant risk. This adaptive, data-driven allocation across states and time maintains essential mobility while protecting Texas from new outbreak waves caused by inbound travel."

This approach minimizes imported infections during the critical initial weeks when Virginia remains vulnerable with a non-negligible exposed and infected population. Using the strict-first-then-relaxed strategy for these high-risk states reduces the cumulative imported infectious pressure, decreasing downstream confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia. New Mexico¡¯s lower infection prevalence and smaller flow justify a mid-relaxed approach to preserve essential mobility without significantly elevating epidemic risk. The staggered relaxation across weeks aligns with the natural epidemic dynamics and evolving local susceptibilities in Virginia, balancing epidemic control and socio-economic needs. Sensitivity analyses show that if prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter or longer early controls would be warranted; conversely, decreases allow more relaxation. Coordinated multi-state policies leveraging these differentiated strategies optimize epidemic and mobility trade-offs, ensuring imported infections are minimized while essential economic and social activities continue. This cross-state cooperation is vital for sustainable epidemic management in a highly interconnected region.'

High-prevalence and high-flow states like Mississippi and Texas receive early strict measures to curb immediate importation, gradually relaxing to restore mobility. Low-prevalence but high-flow New Mexico is granted initial relaxed measures to support essential movement, shifting to stricter controls to hedge against potential outbreaks. Virginia, with moderate prevalence and low flow, adopts balanced mid-level restrictions to maintain stable mobility while controlling risk. This cooperative approach reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths by focusing strict control where risk is highest and preserving mobility where feasible. Weekly fraction adjustments enable adaptive epidemic-mobility trade-offs, reflecting evolving local conditions. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase in any origin state, stricter initial controls would become more crucial to prevent outbreak seeding in Arizona. Conversely, improvements in origin states¡¯ epidemic status could allow more relaxed policies earlier, enhancing mobility benefits. Overall, this policy mix optimizes Arizona's epidemic resilience and economic continuity by leveraging heterogeneous risk profiles and flow patterns across states."

Texas, with the highest infection load and inbound flow, receives the most stringent early restrictions to minimize initial imported infections, leveraging the S1 strategy. Arizona and New Mexico, with lower prevalence but non-negligible flow, also adopt S1 for early strictness but with gradual relaxation to preserve mobility. Virginia, with moderate prevalence and flow, receives a more balanced mid-relaxed approach (S5), allowing flexibility over the 4 weeks. This coordinated policy reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths by focusing strict measures early in states with higher risk while preserving essential mobility in others. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence in any origin state rises, stricter controls earlier would be necessary, increasing the benefit of strategies like S1. Conversely, if transmission rates (beta) decrease due to vaccination or behavior change, more relaxed strategies could be considered. This framework allows adaptive response balancing epidemiological risk and mobility needs, optimizing public health outcomes in Mississippi.'

Mississippi, despite very high prevalence, has low inflow, allowing a relaxed-first-then-strict approach to balance mobility and delayed epidemic risk. Virginia's moderate prevalence and low inflow justify a mid-relaxed approach. The overall strategy reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths by front-loading restrictions where they matter most epidemiologically while preserving essential mobility to support economic and social functions. Quantitatively, the expected imported infected from each state is roughly proportional to inflow * fraction * (I/pop). By choosing stricter fractions initially for high-impact states, imported infections are minimized early, reducing secondary spread risk in New Mexico. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become even more critical; if these parameters decrease, more relaxed policies could be considered without sacrificing epidemic control. This coordinated approach balances epidemiological risk and mobility needs efficiently across multiple origin states and time periods."

This approach takes advantage of the infection dynamics where early weeks pose higher epidemic risks, thereby reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Texas. New Mexico, with a lower infection burden, is assigned a mid-level relaxed strategy to sustain high mobility that supports economic and social activities without significant epidemic risk. This collective strategy balances epidemiological control and essential travel needs, leveraging the fact that infection importation scales with the inbound flow, fraction of allowed flow, and infection prevalence in origin states. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence rises or beta increases, stricter controls earlier become even more critical, while lower prevalence or reduced transmission potential would allow more relaxed strategies. Coordinated implementation across states with tailored strategies reduces the overall infection importation risk, preserving Texas's epidemic stability and mobility demands over the coming 4 weeks."

States with higher infection prevalence and/or larger inbound flows (Mississippi, Texas, Arizona) receive stricter early restrictions (S1) to curb initial importation risk during critical early weeks when Virginia's epidemic is still active. This front-loaded control reduces cumulative infections and delays secondary transmission. New Mexico, with low prevalence and moderate flow, is assigned a mid-relaxed strategy (S5) to preserve mobility while maintaining moderate epidemic safeguards. This differentiated approach leverages quantitative infection-import logic (imported_infected ~ Flow * fraction * I/pop) to optimize epidemic-mobility trade-offs. Cross-state cooperation is vital; stricter early controls on higher-risk states reduce overall imported infections, allowing more relaxation later without overwhelming Virginia's health systems. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, the strict-first strategies provide a flexible buffer by front-loading controls, while uniform or relaxed-first strategies risk higher cumulative imported cases. Conversely, if prevalence declines faster than expected, relaxation can accelerate in later weeks, preserving economic activity. Overall, the strategy portfolio balances epidemic control and essential mobility, minimizing cumulative health impacts in Virginia."

High-risk, high-mobility origins like Texas and Mississippi are assigned strict-first strategies (S1) to reduce initial seeding risks, leveraging the early weeks when control is most impactful. New Mexico, with moderate infections but very high mobility, is assigned a mid-strict pattern (S4) balancing risk reduction and essential flow. Virginia's moderate infection prevalence and lower inflow volume justify a uniform (S3) approach to maintain steady, manageable importation risk. This coordinated multi-state approach leverages temporal variations in control intensity to reduce peak importation while preserving essential mobility. Sensitivity analyses show that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls yield more substantial reductions in imported cases. Conversely, if prevalence falls, relaxation could be expedited. The strategies reflect a balance between epidemic suppression and mobility preservation, acknowledging that overly strict prolonged controls could have economic and social costs, while lax controls risk overwhelming Arizona's healthcare capacity. This calibrated approach aims to optimize public health outcomes through dynamic, data-driven traffic management."

Lower-risk states (New Mexico) benefit from relaxed early controls to maintain essential mobility without significant risk. Virginia's moderate risk prompts a balanced mid-strict approach. This cooperative strategy leverages temporal variation in control strictness to reduce effective imported infections approximately as Flow * ft * (I/pop), dynamically adapting to epidemic and mobility contexts. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infectious prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter or prolonged controls would be necessary, especially for high-flow, high-prevalence states to prevent overwhelming Mississippi's healthcare. Conversely, if prevalence drops faster, relaxation can accelerate. This coordinated, data-driven approach balances epidemic control with socio-economic needs, reducing imported cases and deaths while preserving essential mobility across the region."

States with high inflow and moderate to high infection levels (Arizona and Texas) receive early strict controls (S1) to sharply reduce initial imported infections when New Mexico's epidemic state could be vulnerable. Mississippi, despite high prevalence, has low inflow, allowing a relaxed-then-strict approach (S2) that balances essential mobility with delayed risk mitigation. Virginia's low inflow and moderate prevalence justify a mid-strict uniform strategy (S4) to maintain reasonable travel while managing risk. Quantitatively, the expected imported infected cases scale with inflow * fraction * (I/pop), so reducing fractions in early weeks for high-risk states significantly lowers initial seeding. These strategies cooperate by staggering relaxations and restrictions to avoid simultaneous high-risk importation. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become more critical, while lower beta or prevalence allows more relaxed policies. This adaptive, risk-based approach optimizes epidemic control and mobility preservation simultaneously."

Higher-prevalence states like Mississippi and Arizona receive stricter controls early (S1) to reduce initial seeding risk, reflecting their higher infection ratios and moderate to high inflows. New Mexico, with low infection prevalence but high flow, is assigned a mid-relaxed pattern (S5) to support essential economic and social mobility without substantially increasing epidemic risk. Virginia's moderate prevalence and flow justify a mid-strict approach (S4) to balance epidemic and mobility demands. This mixed strategy portfolio leverages temporal variation in control intensity to suppress importations early when risk is greatest and relax later to alleviate economic impacts. Sensitivity to infection prevalence and transmission rates (beta) is crucial; if beta or prevalence increases, stricter patterns would be warranted to prevent surges. Conversely, reductions in prevalence or improved vaccination/effective treatments could allow more relaxed strategies. Inter-state coordination of these policies is critical to ensure overall epidemic control, as importation from one high-risk state could undermine gains from others. The approach balances epidemiological risk and socioeconomic needs dynamically over the next four weeks to protect Texas' public health while sustaining essential flows."

This reduces the immediate risk of importing infections that could seed new outbreaks in Virginia. For New Mexico, with low prevalence and smaller flow, a more relaxed, mid-distributed strategy balances mobility and risk appropriately. The underlying logic uses the formula: imported infections ¡Ö flow * fraction * (I/pop), focusing on reducing fractions when I/pop is high and flow is large. By staggering strictness early and relaxing later, the policy allows gradual resumption of essential mobility while minimizing cumulative imported cases and deaths. Sensitivity to changes in prevalence or transmission rate (beta) indicates that if prevalence rises or beta increases, stricter early controls become even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence falls, relaxation can be accelerated. Coordination across states ensures that Virginia's epidemic curve is less likely to be impacted by external seeding events, preserving healthcare capacity and public health gains."

States with high prevalence and/or large travel flows to Arizona (Mississippi, Texas) are assigned the strict-first-then-relaxed strategy (S1), prioritizing early reduction of imported cases when risk is highest. New Mexico, with low prevalence but very high mobility, adopts a relaxed-first-then-strict strategy (S2) to preserve economic and social ties initially, tightening controls if needed. Virginia's moderate prevalence and flow lead to a uniform policy (S3), balancing control and mobility evenly over time. Quantitatively, imported infections roughly scale as Flow * ft * (I/pop); thus, front-loading stricter controls in high-risk states reduces cumulative imported infections and potential deaths. This staggered approach also smooths mobility impacts across weeks and states, avoiding simultaneous strict restrictions that could disrupt essential flows. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if transmission rates (beta) increase or prevalence surges, stricter or longer-lasting controls should be considered, especially for high-flow origins. Conversely, if prevalence drops, more relaxed strategies could be adopted earlier. This policy mix aims to minimize Arizona's imported infections and epidemic burden while preserving critical mobility and economic activity."

High-prevalence, high-flow states like Texas and Arizona are handled with a strict-first approach to minimize early-stage imported infections, which is critical given the exponential nature of disease spread. Lower prevalence or lower flow states like New Mexico benefit from a relaxed-first strategy to preserve economic and social mobility while maintaining vigilance. Virginia's moderate risk profile is addressed with a mid-strict strategy balancing epidemic control and mobility. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections are proportional to inflow multiplied by infection prevalence and fraction controls (ft). Prioritizing early strict controls in high-risk states reduces cumulative infections and deaths in Mississippi by lowering the initial seeding. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmissibility (beta) increases, stricter or prolonged controls might be necessary, while decreases allow more relaxation. Cooperation across weeks and states ensures that mobility restrictions are adaptive, protecting public health while minimizing unnecessary disruption. This staged and differentiated approach leverages epidemiological data to optimize epidemic control and mobility preservation."

States with high infected populations and/or high inbound flows (Arizona, Mississippi, Texas) are assigned the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy, imposing the lowest allowed inbound fractions initially to sharply curb imported infections when New Mexico is still vulnerable. This front-loaded strict control reduces the risk of seeding new infections while preserving the capacity to relax measures as local conditions improve. Conversely, Virginia's moderate infection prevalence combined with low inbound flow justifies a more balanced 'S5_mid_relaxed' approach, which maintains essential mobility and economic activity without excessive epidemic risk. Collectively, these policies strategically allocate restrictions to states where the risk and volume justify them, optimizing the epidemiological impact across all origin states. Sensitivity to prevalence and transmission parameters (beta) indicates that if infection prevalence or transmissibility increases, more stringent or extended strict controls would be needed to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, lower prevalence or reduced transmissibility could permit earlier relaxation. This dynamic calibration ensures New Mexico maintains epidemic control while minimizing economic and social disruption from mobility restrictions. Coordination across weeks and states facilitates adaptive, risk-based control that aligns with evolving epidemic and mobility patterns."

Mississippi, with the highest infection ratio (~2.4percent), receives the strictest early control to sharply reduce imported infections, protecting Texas's vulnerable population. Arizona and Virginia, with moderate prevalence (~0.03percent and ~0.12percent), are assigned similar strict-first strategies to limit initial risk but relax controls progressively to support economic and social exchange. New Mexico, with low infection prevalence (~0.018percent) but high inbound flow, is allowed a more relaxed mid strategy that balances reduced risk with critical mobility preservation. This coordinated approach leverages temporal control adjustments (strict early weeks transitioning to relaxed) to best manage fluctuating risk and epidemic evolution in Texas. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increase, stricter or prolonged early controls will be necessary to offset higher importation risks. Conversely, if prevalence declines or beta reduces, relaxed strategies could be adopted earlier to facilitate recovery. Cooperation across states via calibrated temporal fractions enables dynamic epidemic control while preserving essential mobility, minimizing cumulative infections and deaths in Texas."

Texas, with very high population and inflow, uses a relaxed-first then strict pattern (S2) to maintain economic activity initially, tightening later to mitigate rising risks. This coordinated approach leverages temporal variation in controls to reduce cumulative importation risk while preserving mobility, recognizing that early strict control is critical for high-risk origins, and gradual tightening suits high-volume but variable-risk origins.

Mississippi and Texas have relatively high infection prevalence combined with significant inflow, justifying the strict-first-then-relaxed strategy (S1) to front-load controls and reduce early importation risk. New Mexico, despite very low prevalence, has the highest inflow volume, so a mid-relaxed strategy (S5) balances mobility and epidemic control, preventing unnecessary disruption. Virginia's moderate prevalence but low flow leads to choosing a uniform strategy (S3), maintaining steady control without abrupt changes. These coordinated strategies minimize cumulative imported infection pressure on Arizona by adjusting restrictions temporally and spatially based on risk. The fractions reflect a dynamic risk management approach, limiting imported infections when prevalence and inflow are high, then relaxing controls as risk subsides or immunity builds. Sensitivity analyses show that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase in any origin state, shifting to stricter or earlier restrictions would further reduce risks. Conversely, if prevalence drops, relaxing controls earlier could help restore mobility faster. This cooperation across states and weeks optimizes epidemic control while preserving essential travel and economic activity."

States with low infection prevalence and flow (Arizona, New Mexico) adopt strict-first strategies to suppress early importation, leveraging the low risk to allow gradual relaxation. The highest risk state, Texas, with both large population infected counts and massive flow, applies a relaxed-first strategy but tightens progressively to limit cumulative imported infections as Mississippi's epidemic possibly intensifies. Virginia uses a mid-strict approach to balance moderate risk and flow. Quantitatively, the expected imported infected cases each week are proportional to Flow * fraction * (I/pop), and the chosen fractions strategically reduce this sum over time. This cooperative allocation minimizes the overall epidemic seeding risk while preserving essential mobility. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become more beneficial, especially from high-flow states. Conversely, if local Mississippi control improves, relaxation can be expedited to maintain economic and social activity. Thus, these strategies dynamically balance epidemic control and mobility preservation in the context of Mississippi's epidemic parameters and multi-state inflow risks."

States with high infection prevalence and/or large inbound flows, such as Arizona and Texas, receive strategies with stronger initial restrictions to curb early importation risks. Mississippi, despite its smaller inbound flow, has a high infection prevalence, thus also merits stringent early controls. Virginia's moderate prevalence but low flow justifies a similar strict-first approach but with less overall intensity. Quantitatively, imported infected cases depend on the product of inbound flow, fraction of allowed flow (ft), and infection prevalence (I/pop). By front-loading stricter controls in the initial weeks (low ft), New Mexico reduces the immediate risk of seeding local outbreaks, while gradual relaxation allows essential mobility to resume, supporting economic and social needs. The cooperation among strategies ensures that weeks of high import risk are met with stricter controls, collectively lowering cumulative imported infections and deaths. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter or more prolonged controls may be needed, particularly from high-flow states. Conversely, improvements in source states¡¯ epidemic situations could allow more relaxed policies. Overall, this approach strategically tailors controls to origin state risk profiles and mobility volumes, optimizing New Mexico¡¯s epidemic control and mobility balance over the next four weeks."

States with higher infection prevalence relative to population and significant inbound flow, such as Arizona and Mississippi, receive the strict-first-then-relaxed S1 strategy to suppress early infection seeding while gradually restoring mobility. New Mexico, with lower infection prevalence but the highest flow, is assigned the mid-relaxed S5 strategy to maintain essential travel with moderate controls during peak transmission risk. Virginia, with moderate infection risk and flow, is managed with the mid-strict S4 strategy to balance control and mobility. Collectively, these strategies reduce cumulative imported infections by front-loading restrictions where risk is highest and allowing relaxation where safe, thus flattening potential infection import peaks. Inter-week cooperation ensures that restrictions are dynamically balanced to prevent spillover effects between weeks. Sensitivity to changes in prevalence or transmission (beta) suggests that if infection rates rise, stricter initial controls would be necessary, while stable or declining cases could justify more relaxed policies. This adaptive framework optimizes Texas's epidemic control across multiple origin states and time horizons."

States with higher infection prevalence and/or large daily inflows to Virginia, such as Texas, Mississippi, and Arizona, are assigned the 'strict-first-then-relaxed' strategy to enforce stronger controls initially and ease them later as epidemic conditions improve. This approach capitalizes on the temporal dynamics of disease spread and the importance of early intervention to reduce seeding events. New Mexico, with low infection prevalence and moderate flow, receives a more balanced 'mid-relaxed' strategy, preserving essential mobility while maintaining moderate control. Quantitatively, flow multiplied by infection prevalence and control fraction (ft) estimates imported infection risk; minimizing this product early reduces epidemic amplification in Virginia. Cross-state cooperation is implicit in allocating stricter controls to higher-risk origins and more relaxed controls to lower-risk ones, optimizing overall risk reduction without uniformly severe mobility restrictions. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter or longer-lasting controls should be prioritized, especially for large flow states. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta lowers due to vaccination or behavior change, controls can be relaxed sooner to restore mobility. This adaptive, evidence-based allocation balances epidemic control and mobility preservation effectively across states and weeks."

States with high infectious prevalence and/or large inflows (Mississippi, Texas) are assigned strict-first strategies to minimize initial importation risk when Arizona's epidemic is most vulnerable. New Mexico, with very high inflow but lower prevalence, receives a mid-strict pattern balancing control and mobility. Virginia, with moderate prevalence but low flow, is assigned a relaxed-first pattern to preserve mobility early while preparing for increased controls if needed. This coordinated approach leverages temporal control patterns to distribute epidemic risk management over four weeks, minimizing cumulative imported infections. Sensitivity to prevalence and flow is critical: if infectious prevalence rises or beta increases, stricter early controls gain importance; conversely, if prevalence falls, more relaxed allocations could be justified to support economic activity.

High-risk states like Texas and Arizona, with larger infected populations and higher mobility flows, are assigned stricter early-stage controls ('S1_strict_first_then_relaxed') to quickly reduce imported infections during the critical initial weeks. New Mexico, with lower infection prevalence and smaller flows, receives a mid-strict approach ('S4_mid_strict') that enforces moderate restrictions primarily during mid-month to manage potential secondary transmission while allowing reasonable mobility otherwise. Virginia, representing an intermediate risk, adopts a mid-relaxed strategy ('S5_mid_relaxed') that balances infection control with mobility needs. This coordinated approach ensures that the cumulative imported infections and deaths in Mississippi are minimized by front-loading strict controls where risk is highest, while progressively relaxing restrictions in lower-risk or lower-volume origins to preserve essential economic and social activities. Sensitivity to parameter variations, such as changes in beta (transmission rate) or prevalence shifts, highlights the importance of early strict controls for high-risk inflows; if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become even more critical to prevent seeding new outbreaks. Conversely, if infection rates decline, more relaxed strategies could safely maintain mobility. The coordinated multi-week, multi-origin policy integration optimizes the trade-off between epidemic control and mobility, reducing overall epidemic burden in Mississippi."

These states pose the highest risk of importing infectious individuals, and the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy reduces initial imported infections significantly during the crucial early weeks, aligning with New Mexico's moderate infection levels. Virginia, with lower inflow and moderate epidemic metrics, receives a uniform policy balancing risk and mobility preservation. Collectively, these allocations minimize cumulative imported infections and deaths by frontloading restrictions when epidemic risk is greatest, then gradually easing to restore essential economic and social mobility. Sensitivity analyses suggest if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) increase, stricter or prolonged controls would be warranted; conversely, lower prevalence could allow more relaxed patterns. Coordination across origin states ensures that importation risks are managed dynamically, protecting New Mexico's epidemic trajectory while supporting critical inbound traffic. This approach balances public health imperatives with mobility needs, leveraging quantitative infection import logic and epidemic parameters for optimized policy design."

This front-loading of restrictions reduces the seeding of new cases in Texas and allows local epidemic control measures to be more effective. For states with lower infection prevalence but high mobility (New Mexico), a mid-strict approach balances epidemic control and mobility preservation. The cumulative effect of these strategies reduces the expected number of imported infections by applying low fractions during the highest risk periods while permitting gradual relaxation to restore essential economic and social activities. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence rises or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence falls or effective vaccination or NPIs reduce beta, relaxation could be accelerated. Coordination across states ensures that Texas mitigates importation risks without imposing unnecessarily harsh or prolonged restrictions that would harm mobility and economic stability.'

Mississippi and Texas present the highest combined risk due to elevated infected proportions and large mobility volumes, warranting the strict-first-then-relaxed (S1) strategy to minimize early imported cases and deaths. Arizona, with moderate prevalence and high flow, also adopts S1 to contain initial risks while enabling phased reopening. New Mexico's low infected prevalence and smaller inbound flow justify a more relaxed mid-level control (S5), balancing epidemic safety and mobility. This coordinated approach reduces cumulative importation by shifting the majority of inbound flow to later weeks when local Virginia risk is better controlled and vaccination/immunity may have increased. Sensitivity to variations in prevalence or transmission rates (beta) suggests that if infection rates rise, stricter or extended early controls are needed, while lower prevalence could allow more relaxed patterns.

Mississippi and Texas, which have higher infection prevalence and significant flows, are subject to strict-first-then-relaxed (S1) strategies to minimize early imported infections that could seed new outbreaks in Arizona. New Mexico, with low prevalence but large flows, adopts a uniform moderate control (S3) to maintain steady mobility while limiting risks. Virginia, with moderate prevalence and flow, is assigned a mid-strict (S4) strategy to ensure consistent risk mitigation. Collectively, these allocations lower cumulative imported infections by applying stronger controls where prevalence and flow risk are highest early on, then easing as risks wane or local control improves. This phased cooperation across states optimizes epidemic containment without severe mobility disruption. Sensitivity analyses highlight that if prevalence or transmission rates increase in origin states, stricter or longer duration controls would be necessary to avoid overwhelming Arizona's healthcare capacity. Conversely, if local vaccination or immunity improves, mobility can be relaxed more quickly. Continuous monitoring should inform dynamic adjustments to these strategies."

States with high infection prevalence and large inbound flows, notably Texas and Arizona, are assigned the S1 strict-first-then-relaxed strategy to sharply reduce early importation risk, minimizing seeding that could exacerbate Mississippi's epidemic. New Mexico, with lower prevalence and flow, also receives S1 to maintain caution but allow gradual normalization. Virginia, with moderate prevalence and lower flow, is assigned the more balanced S5 mid_relaxed strategy, reflecting a nuanced trade-off between risk reduction and mobility preservation. This coordinated approach leverages temporal heterogeneity in control strictness, front-loading restrictions when Mississippi is most vulnerable, then easing to restore essential travel. Quantitatively, imported infected cases approximate Flow * ft * (I/pop), so front-loaded low ft's on high-flow, high-prevalence states reduce cumulative imported infections and deaths. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls become even more critical. Conversely, if Mississippi's internal epidemic improves faster, relaxation could accelerate. This cooperative, state-specific strategy maximizes epidemic control while preserving vital mobility and economic functions."

This approach leverages the epidemiological principle that early intervention is critical for preventing seeding and exponential spread within the community. States like Texas and Arizona contribute the highest inflow and have moderate infection prevalence, hence strict early controls here substantially reduce imported infections. Mississippi, despite low flow, has a very high infection prevalence, warranting strict early controls to prevent even small but risky importations. Virginia\'s moderate risk and flow also justify early caution. By progressively relaxing controls in later weeks, the strategy balances epidemic control with essential mobility needs, allowing economic and social activities to resume cautiously as risk diminishes or surveillance improves. Quantitatively, minimizing the product of flow, fraction, and infection prevalence in early weeks reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if beta (transmission rate) or prevalence increases, early strict control becomes even more critical, whereas reductions in these parameters could permit more relaxed early strategies. The uniform adoption of S1 ensures coordinated risk mitigation across all source states, maximizing epidemic control benefits for New Mexico while preserving necessary mobility over time.'

States with higher infection prevalence and significant inflows, such as Arizona and Mississippi, are assigned the strict-first strategy (S1) to impose strong initial controls that reduce immediate imported infections, thereby protecting Texas from sudden epidemic surges. New Mexico¡¯s relatively low infection prevalence but high inflow justifies a mid-relaxed approach (S5) to maintain mobility while cautiously managing infection risk. Virginia¡¯s moderate infection prevalence and lower inflow warrant a mid-strict pattern (S4), balancing epidemic control with mobility needs. This coordinated approach effectively reduces expected imported infections by applying stricter controls where the infection load and inflow are highest and relaxing controls where risk is lower. Sensitivity-wise, if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls would further reduce importation risk; conversely, if local Texas immunity improves or beta decreases, some relaxation could be considered earlier. The strategy library¡¯s discrete patterns allow flexible yet scientifically grounded policy adjustments, optimizing epidemic control without unduly compromising essential mobility.'

Arizona, Mississippi, and Texas contribute the highest infection importation risk due to their elevated infected counts combined with significant inbound flows. These states are assigned the S1_strict_first_then_relaxed strategy, emphasizing strong initial restrictions to reduce early imported cases and deaths in Virginia. This approach leverages the nonlinear epidemic dynamics where early seeding events can disproportionately amplify outbreaks. New Mexico's low infection prevalence and lower inbound flow justify a more relaxed mid-term strategy (S5_mid_relaxed), balancing mobility and epidemic risk efficiently. Coordinating these strategies across states reduces cumulative imported infections by front-loading restrictions on high-risk flows while avoiding overly harsh uniform policies that could unnecessarily constrain mobility. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter initial controls become even more critical. Conversely, if these parameters decrease, the system could tolerate more relaxed patterns. This cooperative and dynamic allocation approach aligns with Virginia's objective to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases while preserving essential economic and social functions."
