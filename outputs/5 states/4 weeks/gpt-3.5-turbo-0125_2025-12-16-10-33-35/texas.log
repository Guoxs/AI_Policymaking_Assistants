The imported infected estimation (inflow * fraction * I/pop) suggests that reducing flow early (weeks 1 and 2) would minimize initial seeding of infections.

Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence in any origin state increases or transmission parameters (beta) rise, strict-first strategies become even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence drops or vaccination improves, relaxation can be accelerated without significant risk. This adaptive, data-driven allocation across states and time maintains essential mobility while protecting Texas from new outbreak waves caused by inbound travel."

Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increase, stricter or prolonged early controls will be necessary to offset higher importation risks. Conversely, if prevalence declines or beta reduces, relaxed strategies could be adopted earlier to facilitate recovery. Cooperation across states via calibrated temporal fractions enables dynamic epidemic control while preserving essential mobility, minimizing cumulative infections and deaths in Texas."

Given its large average daily inbound flow to Texas (44086.52), there is significant potential for importing infections. The imported infected estimate can be approximated by Flow * fraction * (I/pop), which with strict early restrictions reduces initial infection import. The S1 strategy, with strict control initially and gradual relaxation, is chosen to minimize early week risks while allowing some mobility later to balance economic and social needs. This approach mitigates initial infection seeding in Texas, which is critical given Texas's large susceptible pool and ongoing infections. The trade-off considers that relaxing controls too soon could increase transmission, while overly strict long-term controls could harm essential mobility; hence, a ramp-up strategy is optimal."
