The infection prevalence is approximately 0.013%, which combined with an inbound flow of 1471.52 into Mississippi implies a notable potential for imported infections, calculated as Flow * ft * (I/pop). Given this moderate risk, a strict-first-then-relaxed strategy (S1) is optimal to minimize early imported infections while allowing mobility to gradually relax as the situation stabilizes. This approach balances epidemic control and economic activity by front-loading restrictions during periods of higher risk and relaxing them later when the imported infection risk diminishes.

This strategy aggressively limits inbound flow fractions initially, reducing the risk of seeding new infections when Mississippi's own infected population remains high. The subsequent relaxation phases balance epidemic control with socioeconomic mobility needs, allowing gradual restoration of travel and trade. The approach leverages the infection import formula Flow * fraction * (I/pop) to target higher-risk states like Texas with strict early controls, while also applying consistent caution to moderate and low-risk states. Cross-state coordination through a unified strategy simplifies implementation and maximizes infection import reduction by frontloading restrictions. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) increases, the strict-first approach gains further importance to prevent surges. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, the relaxation phases can be accelerated. Overall, this strategy reflects a cautious but adaptive policy optimizing epidemic suppression and essential mobility preservation under Mississippi's current epidemic and inflow conditions."

Using the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/pop), even with low flow, the infection proportion can influence risk. Selecting 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' applies strict controls initially (low fractions in weeks 1 and 2) to reduce immediate import risk while relaxing later as local Mississippi dynamics and surveillance improve.

  "global_guidance": "The overall inbound traffic control strategy prioritizes reducing imported infections during Mississippi's critical high-risk period characterized by large exposed and infected populations. States with high infection prevalence and large inbound flows, notably Texas and Arizona, are assigned the S1 strict-first-then-relaxed strategy to sharply reduce early importation risk, minimizing seeding that could exacerbate Mississippi's epidemic. New Mexico, with lower prevalence and flow, also receives S1 to maintain caution but allow gradual normalization. Virginia, with moderate prevalence and lower flow, is assigned the more balanced S5 mid_relaxed strategy, reflecting a nuanced trade-off between risk reduction and mobility preservation. This coordinated approach leverages temporal heterogeneity in control strictness, front-loading restrictions when Mississippi is most vulnerable, then easing to restore essential travel. Quantitatively, imported infected cases approximate Flow * ft * (I/pop), so front-loaded low ft's on high-flow, high-prevalence states reduce cumulative imported infections and deaths. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls become even more critical. Conversely, if Mississippi's internal epidemic improves faster, relaxation could accelerate. This cooperative, state-specific strategy maximizes epidemic control while preserving vital mobility and economic functions."

States with high infection prevalence and large inbound flows, notably Texas and Arizona, are assigned the S1 strict-first-then-relaxed strategy to sharply reduce early importation risk, minimizing seeding that could exacerbate Mississippi's epidemic. New Mexico, with lower prevalence and flow, also receives S1 to maintain caution but allow gradual normalization. Virginia, with moderate prevalence and lower flow, is assigned the more balanced S5 mid_relaxed strategy, reflecting a nuanced trade-off between risk reduction and mobility preservation. This coordinated approach leverages temporal heterogeneity in control strictness, front-loading restrictions when Mississippi is most vulnerable, then easing to restore essential travel. Quantitatively, imported infected cases approximate Flow * ft * (I/pop), so front-loaded low ft's on high-flow, high-prevalence states reduce cumulative imported infections and deaths. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls become even more critical. Conversely, if Mississippi's internal epidemic improves faster, relaxation could accelerate. This cooperative, state-specific strategy maximizes epidemic control while preserving vital mobility and economic functions."
