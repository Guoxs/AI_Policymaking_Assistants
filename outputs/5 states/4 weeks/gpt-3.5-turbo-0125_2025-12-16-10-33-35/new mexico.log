Virginia's low flow and intermediate prevalence justify a mid-relaxed strategy, preserving connectivity while managing risk. Quantitatively, imported infected cases scale as flow * fraction * (I/pop), so strategies target reducing fractions (ft) when risk is greatest. Cooperation across weeks and states reduces overall importation, as stricter early weeks for high-risk states curb early seeding events, while gradual relaxation preserves essential mobility and economic functions. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls would become more imperative, while lower prevalence or beta values could permit more relaxed strategies. This adaptive, heterogeneous approach balances epidemic control and mobility preservation based on origin-specific epidemic and mobility profiles, optimizing New Mexico's public health outcomes over the next 28 days."

  },
  "global_guidance": "The traffic control strategy for New Mexico¡¯s inbound flows is designed to minimize cumulative imported infections and deaths by calibrating restrictions according to each origin state¡¯s infection prevalence and mobility volume. States with high infected populations and/or high inbound flows (Arizona, Mississippi, Texas) are assigned the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy, imposing the lowest allowed inbound fractions initially to sharply curb imported infections when New Mexico is still vulnerable. This front-loaded strict control reduces the risk of seeding new infections while preserving the capacity to relax measures as local conditions improve. Conversely, Virginia's moderate infection prevalence combined with low inbound flow justifies a more balanced 'S5_mid_relaxed' approach, which maintains essential mobility and economic activity without excessive epidemic risk. Collectively, these policies strategically allocate restrictions to states where the risk and volume justify them, optimizing the epidemiological impact across all origin states. Sensitivity to prevalence and transmission parameters (beta) indicates that if infection prevalence or transmissibility increases, more stringent or extended strict controls would be needed to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, lower prevalence or reduced transmissibility could permit earlier relaxation. This dynamic calibration ensures New Mexico maintains epidemic control while minimizing economic and social disruption from mobility restrictions. Coordination across weeks and states facilitates adaptive, risk-based control that aligns with evolving epidemic and mobility patterns."

States with high infected populations and/or high inbound flows (Arizona, Mississippi, Texas) are assigned the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy, imposing the lowest allowed inbound fractions initially to sharply curb imported infections when New Mexico is still vulnerable. This front-loaded strict control reduces the risk of seeding new infections while preserving the capacity to relax measures as local conditions improve. Conversely, Virginia's moderate infection prevalence combined with low inbound flow justifies a more balanced 'S5_mid_relaxed' approach, which maintains essential mobility and economic activity without excessive epidemic risk. Collectively, these policies strategically allocate restrictions to states where the risk and volume justify them, optimizing the epidemiological impact across all origin states. Sensitivity to prevalence and transmission parameters (beta) indicates that if infection prevalence or transmissibility increases, more stringent or extended strict controls would be needed to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, lower prevalence or reduced transmissibility could permit earlier relaxation. This dynamic calibration ensures New Mexico maintains epidemic control while minimizing economic and social disruption from mobility restrictions.

    "notes": "Virginia exhibits moderate epidemic prevalence with exposed (E=119,866) and infected (I=28,770) relative to susceptible (S=7,524,931), giving an infection prevalence of approximately 0.0037. The inbound flow to New Mexico is modest (1,905.38), but because prevalence is non-trivial, imported infection risk remains relevant. Applying a strict-first-then-relaxed approach (S1) reduces imported infections when outbreak seeding is most critical, minimizing early risk without permanently suppressing mobility. The progressive relaxation supports socio-economic needs after initial control. Compared to uniform or relaxed-first strategies, S1 better mitigates early transmission while preserving essential mobility, aligning with Virginia¡¯s moderate infection risk and flow volume."

  "global_guidance": "The collective strategy across all origin states employs the \"S1_strict_first_then_relaxed\" pattern, prioritizing early strict controls to minimize initial importation of infected individuals into New Mexico. This approach leverages the epidemiological principle that early intervention is critical for preventing seeding and exponential spread within the community. States like Texas and Arizona contribute the highest inflow and have moderate infection prevalence, hence strict early controls here substantially reduce imported infections. Mississippi, despite low flow, has a very high infection prevalence, warranting strict early controls to prevent even small but risky importations. Virginia's moderate risk and flow also justify early caution. By progressively relaxing controls in later weeks, the strategy balances epidemic control with essential mobility needs, allowing economic and social activities to resume cautiously as risk diminishes or surveillance improves. Quantitatively, minimizing the product of flow, fraction, and infection prevalence in early weeks reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if beta (transmission rate) or prevalence increases, early strict control becomes even more critical, whereas reductions in these parameters could permit more relaxed early strategies. The uniform adoption of S1 ensures coordinated risk mitigation across all source states, maximizing epidemic control benefits for New Mexico while preserving necessary mobility over time."
