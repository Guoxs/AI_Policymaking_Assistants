The ratio I/pop (~0.00047) combined with a daily inbound flow into Arizona of around 1920 suggests potential importation of infected individuals. Given this, a stricter control initially (12% of total flow allowed in week 1) followed by gradual relaxation aligns with reducing imported infections during the critical early weeks. This phased approach balances the need to suppress early imported infection seeding while allowing some mobility recovery in subsequent weeks.

The infection prevalence (I/population ~ 0.22%) is significantly higher than that of Arizona. Given the average daily inflow of about 2444 persons from Mississippi to Arizona, the product of flow * fraction * infection prevalence indicates a meaningful potential importation of cases. Thus, applying the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy, which imposes stricter control in the initial weeks, effectively curtails early importation risks when Arizona's local epidemic is still sensitive. This phased relaxation balances the need to reduce disease importation while gradually restoring mobility. The trade-off prioritizes epidemic suppression early on with mobility resuming as risk diminishes, aligning with the relatively high risk posed by Mississippi."

However, the low prevalence justifies a uniform control strategy to maintain consistent moderate restrictions over the 4 weeks.

Given a significant average inbound flow into Arizona (~2284 daily), unchecked mobility from Mississippi could import a substantial number of infectious cases: imported_infected ¡Ö flow * ft * (I/pop). The strict-first-then-relaxed strategy is appropriate here to initially minimize high-risk imports, especially in the first 1-2 weeks when local Arizona infection levels remain critical. This approach balances epidemic control with mobility, allowing gradual relaxation as risk diminishes or local control improves. The initial strict control reduces early imported infections that could seed further outbreaks, while later relaxation supports economic and social needs."

The exposed population is also significant at 67,681. Given the high inbound flow to Arizona (1718 daily), the potential for importing infected individuals is considerable. Using the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/pop), stricter control in the initial weeks (ft lower) minimizes early imported cases when Arizona's own epidemic burden remains critical. The strict control first followed by relaxation balances the epidemiological risk by suppressing early importation without permanently shutting down mobility, preserving essential travel and economic ties. This phased approach also allows Arizona to adapt as Mississippi's epidemic potentially improves, mitigating the risk of overwhelming Arizona's healthcare system while maintaining vital connectivity."
