The strict-first-then-relaxed strategy is selected to reduce initial imported infections when epidemic risk is highest, then gradually relax controls as the situation potentially improves. This approach balances minimizing Virginia's exposure to Arizona-origin infections early on while allowing some mobility restoration over the month, preserving essential economic and social connections. The trade-off is justified by Arizona's moderate infection prevalence and high mobility volume, warranting early strict control to mitigate epidemic risk effectively."

The 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy allows imposing strict controls during the first two weeks, substantially reducing transmission risk at the critical early period.

The inbound flow from Arizona to Virginia is substantial (average 6438 daily), which raises the risk of importing infections. Using the infection-import estimation formula (imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/pop)), even a moderate prevalence multiplied by a large inflow could significantly affect Virginia's epidemic. Therefore, a stricter control initially (S1 pattern) is justified to reduce early importation risk when Virginia's local cases are still concerning (I=2431).

  "global_guidance": "The collective strategy prioritizes early stringent control for high-risk origin states (Texas, Mississippi, Arizona) while applying uniform control for low-risk New Mexico. This approach reduces the cumulative imported infection pressure on Virginia, especially in the critical early weeks when Virginia's own epidemic remains significant. The use of S1_strict_first_then_relaxed for states with moderate to high infection prevalence and high inbound flow ensures that the highest risks are mitigated upfront, lowering the potential for new outbreaks and excess deaths. For New Mexico, the uniform moderate control sustains steady mobility with minimal epidemic impact due to its low prevalence and flow. The coordination across origin states leverages temporal and spatial heterogeneity in epidemic risk and mobility flows, optimizing the epidemic-mobility balance. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls become more crucial to prevent spillover infections. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or mobility demands increase, gradual relaxation supports economic recovery. Overall, the policy is designed to minimize Virginia's cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically allocating traffic control intensity based on origin state risk profiles and flow volumes."

This approach reduces the cumulative imported infection pressure on Virginia, especially in the critical early weeks when Virginia's own epidemic remains significant. The use of S1_strict_first_then_relaxed for states with moderate to high infection prevalence and high inbound flow ensures that the highest risks are mitigated upfront, lowering the potential for new outbreaks and excess deaths. For New Mexico, the uniform moderate control sustains steady mobility with minimal epidemic impact due to its low prevalence and flow. The coordination across origin states leverages temporal and spatial heterogeneity in epidemic risk and mobility flows, optimizing the epidemic-mobility balance. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls become more crucial to prevent spillover infections.

The average past inbound flow of 5763.29 combined with a moderate infection prevalence (I/pop ~ 0.000106) implies a non-negligible risk of infected individuals entering Virginia. By selecting the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy, we emphasize stricter controls in the initial weeks (12% of total allowed flow) to reduce early importation of infections, which is critical to prevent seeding outbreaks in Virginia. As time progresses, controls relax allowing higher mobility but after initial risk is mitigated. This approach balances epidemic control with economic and social needs, as too strict prolonged restrictions could hamper essential mobility. The gradual relaxation also aligns with the likelihood of improved epidemic conditions or vaccination coverage."

This coordinated approach minimizes Virginia's imported infection risk by front-loading mobility restrictions during the epidemic's critical early phase when local infections are high. The fraction allocations strictly follow the S1 and S3 patterns to ensure consistent epidemic control across weeks. Quantitatively, the imported infected estimate (Flow * ft * (I/pop)) is minimized initially for high-risk states, reducing Virginia's epidemic seeding and helping flatten the curve. Sensitivity analysis shows that if the infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls become even more critical to prevent exponential growth. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, mobility can be relaxed faster to support economic recovery.

The ratio of infected to total population is low, suggesting a moderate current infectious risk. However, Arizona has a very high average past 21-day inflow (12,775,936), which poses a significant risk for importing infections into Virginia. The imported infections can be approximated by Flow * ft * (I/pop), meaning that even modest infection prevalence with large flows can bring in significant risk. Given this, a stricter control initially (lower fractions in the first week) helps reduce the immediate risk of imported infections when Virginia's own epidemic is still active (I=17,307). Gradually relaxing control over the four weeks balances disease control with the economic and social necessity of mobility. This strategy minimizes initial infection spikes while allowing mobility restoration as risk decreases, addressing the epidemic-mobility trade-off appropriately for Arizona's profile."

The average past 21-day inflow from Mississippi is smaller (2,095) but non-negligible. The infection import risk is Flow * ft * (I/pop), and with higher I/pop ratio, the risk per traveler is elevated. The strict-first-then-relaxed strategy is appropriate here to limit immediate importation of cases into Virginia, which is crucial given Virginia's moderate infection levels. This approach prioritizes epidemic control in the early weeks when risks are high, then eases mobility to allow essential flow, balancing public health with economic activity. Maintaining stricter control early on is vital to prevent exacerbation of Virginia's epidemic."

  "global_guidance": "The overall inbound traffic control strategy prioritizes minimizing imported infections from origin states with higher infection prevalence and larger flows to Virginia. Arizona, Mississippi, and Texas have relatively higher infection ratios combined with significant inbound flows, warranting strict initial traffic reductions (ft ~0.12) to sharply cut early imported infections. This is critical because early-stage importation risks exacerbating Virginia's ongoing epidemic burden (current I=30,586, E=126,980). New Mexico, with very low infection prevalence and flow, is managed with uniform moderate control, preserving steady mobility without undue epidemic risk. Week-by-week graduated relaxation aligns with expected improvements in Virginia¨s internal epidemic state and rising immunity, balancing disease control and socioeconomic activity. Quantitatively, imported infections scale with Flow * ft * (I/pop), so aggressive early reductions in ft for high-risk origins greatly reduce Virginia¨s imported case burden. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if beta (transmission rate) increases, stricter early control is even more crucial to prevent exponential spread. Conversely, if prevalence drops faster than expected, controls can be relaxed more quickly. The coordinated approach ensures that restrictions are targeted and proportional to risk, optimizing epidemic control without unduly restricting essential inflows."
