The infection prevalence (I/pop) is relatively low (~3.39e-5), but the large inbound flow to Texas (average 33,250 daily) could import infections. The imported infected cases roughly scale as Inflow * ft * (I/pop).

This phased approach minimizes early seeding of infections from Arizona while allowing more flow in later weeks as Texas epidemic control improves or vaccination coverage grows.

Gradual relaxation acknowledges the need to sustain economic activity and social connectivity, minimizing disruption while leveraging improved local and origin state epidemic conditions over time. Quantitatively, imported infections are proportional to inbound flow, infection prevalence, and control fractions; thus, concentrating stricter controls during initial weeks when seeding risk is highest optimizes containment. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter or more prolonged controls would be necessary. Conversely, lower prevalence or improved vaccination and treatment could justify earlier relaxation. This policy framework balances epidemiological risk with mobility needs, tailored by origin state risk profiles and flow volumes to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas over the upcoming period."

Virginia, with moderate risk, also follows S1 to mitigate initial seeding while allowing phased reopening. New Mexico, characterized by low infected prevalence but highest inflow, is managed with uniform moderate control (S3) to balance continuous importation risk with essential mobility needs. This coordinated multi-state approach reduces cumulative imported infections by front-loading stricter controls where most needed while smoothing mobility flows elsewhere, optimizing epidemic control and economic activity. Quantitatively, importing infected individuals is proportional to inflow * ft * (I/pop), so states with higher I/pop require lower ft (stricter control) initially. Sensitivity analysis suggests if beta or prevalence increases, the strict-first approach's early impact is increasingly critical to dampen epidemic amplification.

These states adopt the S1 strategy with strict controls in the first weeks to minimize imported infections, thereby protecting Texas's large susceptible population and healthcare burden. Virginia, with moderate risk, also follows S1 to mitigate initial seeding while allowing phased reopening. New Mexico, characterized by low infected prevalence but highest inflow, is managed with uniform moderate control (S3) to balance continuous importation risk with essential mobility needs. This coordinated multi-state approach reduces cumulative imported infections by front-loading stricter controls where most needed while smoothing mobility flows elsewhere, optimizing epidemic control and economic activity. Quantitatively, importing infected individuals is proportional to inflow * ft * (I/pop), so states with higher I/pop require lower ft (stricter control) initially. Sensitivity analysis suggests if beta or prevalence increases, the strict-first approach's early impact is increasingly critical to dampen epidemic amplification. Conversely, lower transmission or prevalence could allow more relaxed uniform strategies.

Given its large average daily inflow to Texas (~44,086), the risk of importing infections is notable. The imported infected cases can be approximated as Inflow * ft * (I / Population), indicating that a strict initial control (low ft) would significantly reduce early importation of infected individuals, which is critical to dampen initial seeding in Texas. The strategy 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' starts with stricter control (lower fractions early) and relaxes over time as the risk decreases or Texas gains control. This balanced approach mitigates the risk while allowing mobility restoration. A uniform or no control strategy would risk higher imported infections initially, which could exacerbate Texas¡¯s epidemic. Hence, strict-first then relaxed is epidemiologically justified given Arizona's moderate infection prevalence and significant mobility contribution."

The infection import risk, proportional to inflow and infection prevalence, necessitates strict initial control to prevent a surge in cases in Texas.

Arizona and Virginia, with moderate prevalence and significant flows, also adopt a strict-first-then-relaxed approach to reduce cumulative infection seeding while allowing progressive mobility recovery. New Mexico, with lower infection levels but highest flow volume, employs uniform moderate control to maintain steady mitigation without undue disruption. This coordinated approach leverages temporal allocation to frontload restrictions when epidemic risks are highest, thus reducing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, maintaining or intensifying early restrictions yields better control. Conversely, if local epidemic control in Texas improves or origin states¡¯ prevalence decrease, gradual relaxation can be accelerated. Overall, the strategy balances epidemiological risk reduction with essential mobility preservation, optimizing public health outcomes alongside economic and social considerations."

Mississippi, with a high infection density but smaller population, receives strict early restrictions to sharply curtail importation risk when Texas remains vulnerable. Arizona and Virginia, with moderate prevalence and significant flows, also adopt a strict-first-then-relaxed approach to reduce cumulative infection seeding while allowing progressive mobility recovery. New Mexico, with lower infection levels but highest flow volume, employs uniform moderate control to maintain steady mitigation without undue disruption.
