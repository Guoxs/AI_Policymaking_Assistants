However, Arizona's daily inflow to Mississippi is moderate (1596.33), and imported infections can accumulate over time. Applying the 'strict first then relaxed' strategy, with early strong controls (lower ft) ramping to relaxed controls, helps to suppress initial imported infections during critical early weeks when Mississippi's local epidemic is still active (I=3822). The imported infected estimate is roughly Flow * ft * (I/pop), so early strictness reduces imported infections when imported risk is highest.

The exposed (E=13,354) and confirmed (Q=18,581) counts are notable but not alarming relative to size. Given the past 21-day average inflow into Mississippi from Arizona is moderate (2,988 daily historically, now forecasted at 2,601.43), the potential imported infected estimate is approximately Flow * ft * (I / population) = 2601.43 * ft * (884 / 8,313,112). Selecting 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' imposes stronger controls early on (lower ft values), reducing the initial importation risk when Mississippi's local epidemic is still significant (I=15,509). This phased relaxation balances disease control with mobility needs, easing restrictions as Arizona's risk stabilizes or Mississippi's local control improves. The trade-off respects Arizona¡¯s moderate prevalence, preventing an early surge of imported cases while avoiding excessive long-term mobility restrictions."

However, with an average forecasted daily inbound flow of 1,605.76 people to Mississippi and the infectious proportion being approximately 351 / 4,556,923, the importation risk remains non-negligible. Applying the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy aligns with the need to mitigate early imported infections when Mississippi's epidemic load is still considerable. Early strict control minimizes initial risk, allowing Mississippi's own control measures to gain effect. As local conditions improve, relaxation respects New Mexico¡¯s low prevalence, enabling essential mobility without escalating imported cases.

Given Mississippi's own high infectious load, strict early controls on Texas inbound traffic are necessary to prevent exacerbation of local transmission. The 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy prioritizes early reduction of traffic, lowering imported infections during Mississippi's critical period, and gradually relaxes as conditions improve.

This phased approach reduces the seeding of new cases, allowing local control measures to gain effectiveness. For Virginia, with moderate infection prevalence and inflow, a uniform control strategy is chosen to maintain steady mitigation without abrupt changes, balancing risk and mobility. Quantitatively, imported infections approximate Flow * ft * (I/S), so states with larger infected populations and flows require stricter control factors initially. Across all states, this cooperation reduces cumulative imported infections and consequently deaths, preventing healthcare overload. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter or longer-lasting controls would be necessary; conversely, if local conditions improve, controls can be relaxed earlier.

The daily inbound flow to Mississippi is very high (~30,566), making Texas the most critical origin state regarding potential infection importation. Estimated imported infections are roughly 30,566 * ft * (37,336/19,508,125), which is substantial. Thus, applying the 'strict first then relaxed' strategy (S1) is essential to impose strong initial flow restrictions, reducing immediate risk of seeding outbreaks in Mississippi. Gradual relaxation as weeks progress accommodates economic and social mobility needs while prioritizing epidemic control early when risk is greatest."

    "notes": "Virginia's infected count (I=28,352) and exposed individuals (E=118,386) suggest a notable epidemic presence, with a population of about 7.5 million. The daily inflow to Mississippi is moderate (~3,576). The imported infection estimate is approximately 3,576 * ft * (28,352/7,566,644), which indicates a moderate infection importation risk. Selecting the 'strict first then relaxed' strategy (S1) balances the need to reduce imported infections early on, given Virginia's infection levels, while allowing incremental restoration of mobility in later weeks. This approach helps protect Mississippi's vulnerable population and healthcare capacity from initial influxes of infections."

  "global_guidance": "The collective choice of the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' inbound traffic allocation strategy for all origin states reflects a unified policy prioritizing early strict control measures to minimize imported infections and deaths in Mississippi. This approach leverages the epidemic dynamics: all origin states have non-negligible infected and exposed populations, with Texas and Arizona posing the highest importation risk due to their large infected populations and/or high daily inbound flows. By frontloading stricter controls (12% and 21% of baseline flows in the first two weeks), the policy reduces the immediate seeding of infections, allowing Mississippi's healthcare system and epidemic control measures to stabilize. As weeks progress and local containment improves, gradual relaxation (31% and 36% in weeks 3 and 4) restores essential mobility and economic activities, balancing public health and social needs. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stronger or prolonged restrictions may be necessary, while improvements in prevalence or vaccination coverage could allow faster relaxation. The uniform adoption of S1 across states simplifies enforcement and communication, ensuring consistent risk mitigation tailored to the combined epidemic and mobility profiles. This coordinated strategy minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi by limiting early high-risk importations while preserving mobility critical for socio-economic resilience."
