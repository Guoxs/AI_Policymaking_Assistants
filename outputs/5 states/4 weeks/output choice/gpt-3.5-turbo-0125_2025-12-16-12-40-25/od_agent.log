This approach minimizes cumulative imported infections by reducing the early influx of infected individuals when Arizona¡¯s susceptible population is large, thus limiting secondary transmission. The phased relaxation of controls for higher-risk states in weeks 3 and 4 balances epidemic control with the economic and social need for mobility restoration. Quantitatively, imported infected cases approximate Flow * ft * (I/pop), so lower ft values early on suppress this importation effectively. Cooperation across weeks and states ensures that early epidemic seeding is minimized, which has outsized impact on overall outbreak size. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter or longer duration controls would be needed, while lower prevalence or transmission would permit more relaxed policies. This strategy suite balances epidemiological risk with maintaining essential mobility, aiming to minimize Arizona¡¯s cumulative confirmed and deceased cases while preserving critical inbound traffic flows.'

Texas, with low prevalence but very high mobility, receives a uniform control strategy to maintain essential flows while mitigating risk consistently. This coordinated approach balances the epidemic risk (quantified by infectious prevalence and inflow) and mobility needs, minimizing total imported infections and deaths. Early strict control phases reduce seeding events that can amplify local outbreaks in Mississippi, while relaxed later phases enable essential mobility and economic activity. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter or prolonged controls become more critical for higher prevalence states. Conversely, if prevalence declines or vaccination progresses, gradual relaxation could be accelerated. Coordinated cross-state control leverages temporal dynamics and infection prevalence to optimize epidemic and economic trade-offs, preserving public health while sustaining vital mobility corridors.'

By adopting the 'strict-first-then-relaxed' pattern uniformly, New Mexico reduces the risk of early seeding events from all sources, especially those with high inflow volumes or higher infectious prevalence. Quantitatively, imported infections are proportional to the product of baseline inflow, control fraction ft, and infection prevalence (I/pop). Arizona and Texas, with their massive flows, pose the greatest risk despite differing infection ratios, demanding early lower ft values to suppress importation. Mississippi's higher prevalence but smaller flow still requires early stringent control to prevent disproportionate impact. Virginia, with moderate prevalence and low flow, benefits similarly from early caution. As the weeks progress, relaxing controls balances economic mobility needs with reduced epidemic risk due to potential immunity gains and improved local containment. This coordinated approach across states leverages temporal control intensity to minimize cumulative imported infections and deaths. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if transmission rates (beta) increase, the early strictness becomes even more critical, while lower prevalence states might tolerate relatively relaxed controls. Conversely, if prevalence estimates are underestimated, the uniform strict-first approach provides a robust buffer. Overall, this policy mix optimizes epidemic control without unduly compromising essential mobility, particularly from high-volume states."

Mississippi and New Mexico have the highest infected proportions (5.90e-4 and 6.10e-4 respectively) combined with substantial inflows, making early strict control imperative to reduce Texas's imported infection burden. Arizona, with moderate prevalence and high inflow, also benefits from early strict control to curb initial seeding. Virginia's moderate prevalence and lower inflow justify a uniform strategy, balancing control and mobility without unnecessary restrictions. This coordinated approach minimizes cumulative infections and deaths in Texas by concentrating stricter controls in the epidemic's early phase when imported infections have the greatest impact on local epidemic growth. Later weeks apply relaxed controls to restore mobility and economic activity. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence in origin states increases, stricter early controls become more critical, while if transmission rates (beta) decrease, control intensity could be modulated accordingly. This multi-state cooperation in traffic allocation optimizes epidemic control-mobility trade-offs, preserving essential flows while protecting Texas's public health."

States with higher infection prevalence and/or high mobility volumes¡ªArizona, Mississippi, and Texas¡ªare assigned the 'strict-first-then-relaxed' strategy, prioritizing early stringent control to reduce initial imported infection seeding. This front-loaded approach addresses the higher early epidemic risk and allows gradual restoration of mobility as risks potentially decline. New Mexico, with moderate infection prevalence and relatively lower mobility, is assigned a uniform control strategy to maintain steady mitigation without excessive disruption. Collectively, these strategies reduce aggregated imported infections by lowering the product of inbound flow, control fraction, and infection prevalence in the early weeks when viral spread risk is highest. Sensitivity to prevalence changes indicates that if infectious counts rise, stricter early controls are more critical; if beta (transmission rate) increases, the importance of reducing early imported cases intensifies, justifying the chosen front-loaded controls. Conversely, if prevalence or beta declines, a more relaxed or uniform approach could suffice. This cooperative control scheme across states balances epidemic containment and essential mobility, aiming to limit Virginia's epidemic burden while sustaining vital economic and social linkages."

Mississippi and Texas, with higher infected counts and/or very large travel volumes, are controlled strictly in the initial weeks to reduce seeding risk, gradually relaxing as infection risks are expected to decline or be managed. New Mexico and Virginia, with lower infection prevalence or smaller flows, maintain uniform moderate controls to balance epidemic control with essential mobility. This cooperation across states leverages temporal and spatial heterogeneity in epidemic risk and travel patterns to optimize overall risk reduction. Sensitivity analysis reveals that if infection prevalence increases or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early controls or extended duration might be warranted. Conversely, if prevalence falls or beta decreases, a more relaxed or uniform approach could be justified. This strategic layering of controls acknowledges both epidemiological dynamics and socio-economic necessities, aiming to minimize imported cases and deaths in Arizona while preserving vital mobility links.'

Texas, with the largest inflow and notable infected prevalence, is assigned the 'strict first then relaxed' strategy to minimize initial imported infections during Mississippi's vulnerable phase. Arizona and New Mexico, with lower prevalence but moderate inflows, also follow this strategy to suppress early importation risk while gradually restoring mobility. Virginia, with moderate infection and inflow levels, adopts a uniform control pattern to maintain consistent mitigation without abrupt mobility changes. This cross-state coordination reduces cumulative imported infection risk, limiting the burden on Mississippi's healthcare system and enabling better epidemic control locally. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more critical to prevent epidemic resurgence. Conversely, if prevalence drops or vaccination improves, controls can be relaxed earlier. This adaptive approach ensures a balance between epidemic suppression and essential mobility, minimizing economic and social disruption while protecting public health."

This approach prioritizes strong early restrictions to reduce the seeding of new infections from states with varying infection prevalence and mobility volumes. Arizona and Texas contribute the largest inbound flows, while Mississippi has the highest infection prevalence, necessitating early strict control to mitigate importation risk. Virginia's moderate infection prevalence and low flow also justify early restrictions. By progressively easing controls in later weeks, the policy balances epidemic suppression with the need for economic and social mobility, preserving essential connections. Quantitatively, imported infections approximate Flow * ft * (I/pop), so controlling ft (traffic fractions) early reduces expected cases substantially. Coordination across states leverages temporal dynamics, reducing cumulative risk while allowing gradual normalization. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter or longer controls would be justified; conversely, lower prevalence or effective local containment could permit faster relaxation. This policy thus offers a robust, adaptive framework to manage epidemic risk from inbound traffic while preserving critical mobility for New Mexico."

This reduces the initial imported infected load during Texas's current epidemic risk phase, leveraging temporal control dynamics to gradually restore mobility as epidemic conditions improve. For New Mexico, despite its low prevalence, the large inbound flow necessitates a uniform moderate control strategy (S3_uniform) to consistently manage infection risk without disrupting critical mobility links. Quantitatively, imported infected cases are approximately proportional to inflow * ft * (I/pop), so controlling ft early in higher-risk states significantly lowers imported infections, reducing Texas's cumulative cases and deaths. The phased approach allows adaptive mitigation that adjusts to evolving local and external epidemic states. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, earlier and stricter controls become more crucial to prevent seeding new outbreaks in Texas. Conversely, if prevalence declines or beta reduces due to interventions or vaccination, more relaxed strategies could be adopted sooner to facilitate mobility. This coordinated multi-state control framework balances epidemic suppression with economic and social mobility, aiming to minimize Texas's epidemic burden while preserving essential inbound flow integrity."

By enforcing the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' pattern for these states, we front-load the epidemic control effort during the first weeks, reducing the initial importation of infectious individuals that could trigger outbreaks in Virginia. This reduces cumulative infections and deaths by lowering the seeding risk when Virginia's local epidemic is still active. For New Mexico, with a comparatively low infection prevalence and a small inbound flow, a uniform strategy (S3_uniform) balances epidemic risk and mobility without unnecessary disruption. The quantitative infection-import risk is approximated by Flow * ft * (I/pop), so states with higher I/pop or Flow require stricter early control (lower ft early). Across weeks, the phased relaxation accounts for improving local epidemic conditions and the need to restore economic activity. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence (I/pop) or transmission rates (beta) increase, initial strict control becomes even more critical to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence declines or beta decreases due to vaccination or NPIs, more relaxed strategies could be considered. Coordinated multi-state strategies reduce overall importation risk synergistically, protecting Virginia's population while preserving essential interstate mobility."

Mississippi, New Mexico, and Texas, all presenting considerable infection prevalence combined with moderate to very high inflow volumes, are assigned a 'strict-first then relaxed' strategy. This approach front-loads travel restrictions to suppress early importation when Arizona's own epidemic is active, then gradually restores mobility to mitigate socio-economic impacts. Virginia, with moderate infection rates but lower travel volume, is managed uniformly to maintain steady flow while controlling risks. Quantitatively, the imported infected flow is modulated by daily inflow, infection prevalence, and control fraction ft; thus, the chosen strategies reduce the product of these variables, especially in weeks 1 and 2. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates rise, stricter early controls yield greater benefits by curbing seeding events. Conversely, if prevalence declines or beta reduces, mobility can be relaxed sooner with minimal risk. This coordinated multi-state strategy leverages temporal and spatial heterogeneity in epidemic risk and travel patterns to optimize Arizona¡¯s disease control and mobility preservation objectives."

The strategy for all origin states is a strict-first-then-relaxed control pattern (S1), which frontloads stricter traffic restrictions in weeks 1 and 2, gradually relaxing to allow mobility recovery. This pattern minimizes initial imported infections, crucial for blunting early epidemic spikes in Mississippi. Quantitatively, expected imported infections scale with inbound flow, infected prevalence (I/pop), and control fraction (ft). States like Texas with high infected counts and large flows require stringent early control, while lower-risk states still benefit from this approach to prevent cumulative case growth. Coordinated timing across states amplifies effect: simultaneous early reduction of importation lowers risk synergistically. Sensitivity analysis shows if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls further reduce risk, justifying frontloaded policies. Conversely, if prevalence falls, gradual relaxation preserves essential connectivity. This balanced approach aligns with epidemic control imperatives and socioeconomic needs, offering a robust, adaptive framework for minimizing disease importation into Mississippi over the next 28 days."

Arizona, Mississippi, and Texas are assigned the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy due to their moderate-to-high infection ratios combined with substantial or significant inflows into New Mexico. This front-loaded strict control pattern reduces the initial importation of infections when the risk is greatest, helping to prevent seeding new outbreaks and overwhelming local health systems in New Mexico. The gradual relaxation balances epidemic control with economic recovery and mobility needs over the 4-week horizon. Virginia, with relatively low infection prevalence and minimal inflow, is assigned a uniform moderate control (S3), reflecting a lower risk profile and allowing steady mobility. This diverse strategy portfolio leverages epidemiological data and mobility patterns to efficiently allocate control efforts where they are most impactful. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase in any origin state, stricter or more prolonged controls would be warranted to avoid spikes in imported cases. Conversely, if prevalence drops or vaccine coverage improves, controls can relax sooner. Maintaining flexibility and monitoring real-time data will be essential to adapt strategies dynamically. Coordinated multi-state control efforts, as modeled here, optimize New Mexico's epidemic resilience while sustaining critical economic and social connectivity."

Early strict controls reduce the immediate importation of infectious individuals, lowering Texas's risk of epidemic resurgence or increased mortality. Gradual relaxation acknowledges the need to sustain economic activity and social connectivity, minimizing disruption while leveraging improved local and origin state epidemic conditions over time. Quantitatively, imported infections are proportional to inbound flow, infection prevalence, and control fractions; thus, concentrating stricter controls during initial weeks when seeding risk is highest optimizes containment. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter or more prolonged controls would be necessary. Conversely, lower prevalence or improved vaccination and treatment could justify earlier relaxation. This policy framework balances epidemiological risk with mobility needs, tailored by origin state risk profiles and flow volumes to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas over the upcoming period."

This approach reduces the cumulative imported infection pressure on Virginia, especially in the critical early weeks when Virginia's own epidemic remains significant. The use of S1_strict_first_then_relaxed for states with moderate to high infection prevalence and high inbound flow ensures that the highest risks are mitigated upfront, lowering the potential for new outbreaks and excess deaths. For New Mexico, the uniform moderate control sustains steady mobility with minimal epidemic impact due to its low prevalence and flow. The coordination across origin states leverages temporal and spatial heterogeneity in epidemic risk and mobility flows, optimizing the epidemic-mobility balance. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls become more crucial to prevent spillover infections. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or mobility demands increase, gradual relaxation supports economic recovery. Overall, the policy is designed to minimize Virginia's cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically allocating traffic control intensity based on origin state risk profiles and flow volumes."

Mississippi and Texas, with higher infection prevalence and large inflows, receive the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy to strongly suppress early transmission risk and then ease controls as epidemic conditions stabilize. New Mexico and Virginia, having lower prevalence or smaller flows, are managed with a 'S3_uniform' strategy maintaining consistent moderate restrictions to balance risk and mobility. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections scale with flow * fraction * (I/population), so imposing stricter controls (lower fractions) in higher risk states reduces imported infections early on when Arizona is vulnerable. The phased relaxation in high-risk states supports economic and social needs while prioritizing epidemic control. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter or longer initial controls would be warranted. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed or uniform strategies could be employed. This coordinated multi-state approach collectively minimizes the risk of seeding new outbreaks in Arizona while preserving essential mobility and economic activity."

All origin states exhibit non-negligible infectious populations, with Texas posing the highest risk given its large infectious count and very high inbound flow. Arizona, New Mexico, and Virginia present moderate to low infectious prevalence but still warrant caution due to their mobility volumes. The consistent selection of the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy across all origin states reflects a precautionary principle: imposing stricter controls initially to sharply curtail imported infections when Mississippi's epidemic burden is high, then gradually relaxing as local conditions improve or as epidemic risk declines in origin states. This phased approach aligns with epidemiological understanding that early intervention yields outsized benefits in outbreak control, while gradual relaxation mitigates economic and social disruptions. Quantitatively, the imported infected count is proportional to the product of inbound flow, the control fraction ft, and the infectious prevalence (I/population). By front-loading stricter controls (lower ft values) early weeks, the cumulative imported infections are significantly reduced, especially from high-risk Texas. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) were to increase, stricter and possibly prolonged control would be necessary to maintain control, highlighting the importance of adaptive policy. Conversely, if local epidemic control in Mississippi improves faster than expected, relaxation can be accelerated. This cooperative, data-driven approach balances epidemic control with essential cross-state mobility, supporting public health and economic resilience."

Arizona and Texas, with large populations and high mobility, present substantial importation risks even with moderate prevalence, necessitating early strict control to prevent seeding new infections in New Mexico. Mississippi's high infected fraction, despite smaller flow, similarly demands strict initial control to minimize high-risk imports. Virginia¡¯s moderate prevalence but low flow justifies the same cautious approach to avoid unnoticed epidemic seeding. This uniform adoption of the S1 strategy across origin states facilitates coordinated epidemic suppression while progressively restoring essential travel and commerce. Quantitatively, imported infections are proportional to flow * ft * (I/pop), and minimizing ft early reduces cumulative imported cases and deaths. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter front-loaded controls become even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence declines or vaccines reduce transmission, gradual relaxation maintains mobility without compromising epidemic control. This coordinated, adaptive policy balances epidemic risks and mobility needs, optimizing public health outcomes for New Mexico."

States with higher infection prevalence (Mississippi and Arizona) are assigned strict-first-then-relaxed strategies (S1) to impose strong early restrictions, reducing initial imported infections when Texas is vulnerable due to its current infected and exposed counts. This approach leverages the multiplicative effect of controlling flow early to decrease cumulative infections. New Mexico, having a low infection prevalence but high mobility volume, is assigned a uniform control strategy (S3) to balance ongoing importation risk and maintain consistent essential traffic. Virginia, with moderate prevalence and mobility, also follows S1 to prioritize early risk reduction with gradual relaxation. The coordination across weeks and states ensures that the highest risks are curbed initially, preventing overwhelming Texas's healthcare while gradually restoring mobility to avoid economic disruption. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter or more prolonged controls would be warranted. Conversely, if Texas's own epidemic improves, relaxation could accelerate. This policy optimally balances epidemic control and mobility preservation under current conditions, leveraging epidemic data and flow volumes to minimize imported infections and deaths."

This front-loaded control approach minimizes the initial importation of infected individuals, reducing the risk of seeding new outbreaks in Virginia during a critical phase. The uniform strategy for New Mexico reflects its low infection prevalence and lower inbound flow, allowing for steady mobility without excessive restrictions. Collectively, these strategies reduce the expected imported infected cases approximately proportional to the product of each state's flow, infection prevalence, and traffic fractions. The gradual relaxation in weeks 3 and 4 for higher-risk states balances epidemic control with essential mobility to support economic and social needs. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if viral transmissibility (beta) or infection prevalence increases, stricter initial controls or longer duration of restrictions may be warranted. Conversely, if prevalence declines due to vaccination or natural epidemic dynamics, relaxation could be accelerated. Coordination across states ensures that Virginia's inbound infection risk is managed efficiently, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths while preserving critical mobility."

States with higher infection prevalence and significant inflow to Arizona, such as Mississippi and Texas, are subjected to a strict-first-then-relaxed strategy. This front-loaded control reduces early importation risk when Arizona¡¯s local epidemic remains active, limiting seeding and secondary transmission. Meanwhile, states with low or moderate infection prevalence but high or moderate flow volumes, such as New Mexico and Virginia, adopt uniform control strategies to maintain consistent mitigation without abrupt disruptions. This combination leverages temporal and spatial heterogeneity in epidemic risk and mobility needs, optimizing overall risk reduction. The approach assumes infection prevalence and flow rates remain stable; sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence increases or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter or extended controls may be warranted, especially in high-flow states. Conversely, reductions in prevalence or beta could allow for more relaxed strategies. Coordination across states balances epidemic suppression with economic and social imperatives, ensuring Arizona receives essential mobility with minimized risk of imported cases and deaths.'

By frontloading stricter controls (12percent week 1, 21percent week 2) and progressively relaxing (31percent, 36percent), the policy reduces cumulative imported infectious pressure while gradually restoring mobility necessary for economic and social activity. Quantitatively, imported infected cases are proportional to inflow * ft * (I/population), so applying lower ft values early across states with varying prevalence and inflows synergistically reduces risk. Texas, with the highest inflow and notable prevalence, benefits most from this approach, while states like New Mexico, with lower prevalence and inflow, also contribute to reduced importation risk. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter or longer-duration controls may be warranted; conversely, if local immunity or vaccination improves, relaxation could accelerate. This coordinated, adaptive policy balances epidemic control with essential mobility, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next four weeks."

These states exhibit significant infection levels and volumes of inbound travel, which pose substantial risk for seeding new cases in New Mexico. The S1_strict_first_then_relaxed strategy effectively frontloads control efforts to the earliest weeks, curbing the initial surge of imported infections when the risk of outbreaks and healthcare strain is highest. This approach balances epidemic risks with preserving essential mobility and economic activity, allowing gradual relaxation as the epidemic impact potentially diminishes or adapts. For Virginia, with moderate infection prevalence and lower flow, a uniform control strategy (S3) is more appropriate to maintain steady, manageable risk while preserving mobility. Collectively, these strategies optimize epidemic control by targeting states contributing the most to importation risk with tighter early controls and applying moderate, consistent control to lower-risk states. Sensitivity to changes in infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) suggests that if infection levels rise, stricter or more prolonged controls may be needed; conversely, if prevalence declines, relaxation could be expedited. This adaptive, risk-based allocation ensures New Mexico minimizes cumulative cases and deaths from imported infections while safeguarding necessary travel and commerce.'

This strict-first approach minimizes the seeding of new infections while allowing mobility to gradually increase as the local and imported risk potentially decreases or is better managed. For New Mexico, with notably low infection prevalence, a uniform control strategy effectively balances importation risk and mobility needs, avoiding unnecessarily harsh restrictions that could harm local economies. Across all states, the flow-weighted infection import risk is carefully considered: imported_infected ¡Ö daily_inflow * ft * (I / total_population). This approach collectively minimizes cumulative infections and deaths in Texas by limiting initial high-risk inflows and progressively relaxing control as risks moderate. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence rises or transmission rates increase (beta), stricter early controls become even more critical to curb imported cases. Conversely, if prevalence drops or vaccination increases, greater relaxation can be safely permitted earlier. This coordinated multi-state strategy ensures epidemic control while preserving essential mobility, optimizing public health outcomes and economic resilience for Texas."

New Mexico, with low prevalence and minimal inflow, is managed with uniform moderate control to sustain stable mobility without compromising safety. This coordinated approach reduces the cumulative imported infections and deaths in Virginia by frontloading strict control measures when epidemic risks are highest, then relaxing controls as risks subside and local immunity or interventions improve. Weekly allocation fractions are tailored to maintain the overall pattern, enabling smooth transitions and avoiding abrupt shifts that could disrupt essential mobility. Sensitivity to infection prevalence and transmissibility (beta) is critical; higher beta or prevalence would warrant more stringent or prolonged restrictions, while lower values might allow faster relaxation. Cross-state cooperation is implicit as controlling high-risk origins early limits infection seeding into Virginia, reducing secondary transmission chains. This balance between epidemic control and mobility preservation aligns with public health goals and socioeconomic stability, optimizing outcomes in a dynamic, interconnected environment.'

This front-loaded control reduces the seeding of infections during the most vulnerable period, helping to prevent exponential growth in Arizona's case counts and deaths. New Mexico, with low prevalence but high inflow, is managed with uniform moderate control to sustain essential mobility while limiting risk. The overall policy leverages temporal allocation of control measures to balance epidemiological risk and socioeconomic needs. By focusing stricter controls early, the policy exploits the infection dynamics where early importation seeds larger outbreaks. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter or more prolonged controls would be necessary, while improvements in local vaccination or treatment could allow faster relaxation. Cross-state coordination in timing and intensity ensures that Arizona minimizes imported infections, reduces cumulative burden, and preserves critical mobility for economic and social resilience."

This phased approach reduces the seeding of new cases, allowing local control measures to gain effectiveness. For Virginia, with moderate infection prevalence and inflow, a uniform control strategy is chosen to maintain steady mitigation without abrupt changes, balancing risk and mobility. Quantitatively, imported infections approximate Flow * ft * (I/S), so states with larger infected populations and flows require stricter control factors initially. Across all states, this cooperation reduces cumulative imported infections and consequently deaths, preventing healthcare overload. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter or longer-lasting controls would be necessary; conversely, if local conditions improve, controls can be relaxed earlier.

Mississippi's very high infection ratio demands strict early control to prevent seeding outbreaks in New Mexico, despite its low flow. Arizona and Virginia, with moderate infection ratios and flows, benefit from strict-first-then-relaxed patterns to minimize early high-risk importation while allowing mobility recovery. Texas, with a large population and flow but lower infection ratio, is best managed with uniform moderate controls to balance importation risk and mobility. Collectively, these strategies reduce New Mexico's cumulative imported infections by front-loading restrictions where risk is highest and easing them as conditions improve, minimizing epidemic pressure without excessive mobility loss. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) rise, earlier and stricter controls would be required. Conversely, reductions in these parameters might allow more relaxed traffic policies. Coordination across states and weeks ensures that imported infections are minimized early, reducing local transmission amplification potential and cumulative morbidity and mortality in New Mexico."

These states adopt the S1 strategy with strict controls in the first weeks to minimize imported infections, thereby protecting Texas's large susceptible population and healthcare burden. Virginia, with moderate risk, also follows S1 to mitigate initial seeding while allowing phased reopening. New Mexico, characterized by low infected prevalence but highest inflow, is managed with uniform moderate control (S3) to balance continuous importation risk with essential mobility needs. This coordinated multi-state approach reduces cumulative imported infections by front-loading stricter controls where most needed while smoothing mobility flows elsewhere, optimizing epidemic control and economic activity. Quantitatively, importing infected individuals is proportional to inflow * ft * (I/pop), so states with higher I/pop require lower ft (stricter control) initially. Sensitivity analysis suggests if beta or prevalence increases, the strict-first approach's early impact is increasingly critical to dampen epidemic amplification. Conversely, lower transmission or prevalence could allow more relaxed uniform strategies. This dynamic, data-driven allocation enhances Texas's epidemic resilience through adaptive, risk-based mobility management."

This coordinated approach minimizes Virginia's imported infection risk by front-loading mobility restrictions during the epidemic's critical early phase when local infections are high. The fraction allocations strictly follow the S1 and S3 patterns to ensure consistent epidemic control across weeks. Quantitatively, the imported infected estimate (Flow * ft * (I/pop)) is minimized initially for high-risk states, reducing Virginia's epidemic seeding and helping flatten the curve. Sensitivity analysis shows that if the infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls become even more critical to prevent exponential growth. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, mobility can be relaxed faster to support economic recovery. The chosen strategies reflect a balanced trade-off between epidemic control and maintaining essential mobility, ensuring that imported cases and deaths are collectively minimized while allowing gradual normalization of travel as conditions improve."

This reduces seeding of new cases and deaths in Arizona, which currently has moderate local infection levels. For New Mexico and Virginia, where either infectious prevalence or inbound flows are moderate to low, a uniform control strategy is employed to sustain essential mobility without causing undue economic disruption. This calibrated approach leverages quantitative infection-import logic (imported_infected ~ flow * ft * (I/pop)) to optimize epidemic-mobility trade-offs. Sensitivity to changes in beta or prevalence suggests that stricter controls upfront are especially valuable if transmission rates climb, whereas if prevalence falls or beta reduces, gradual relaxation can accelerate. Coordination across states ensures that Arizona¡¯s epidemic burden is minimized by limiting high-risk importations early while maintaining essential flows. This balanced, data-informed multi-state allocation minimizes overall expected infections and deaths in Arizona over the next month while preserving critical economic and social connectivity."

This front-loaded control pattern aims to minimize imported infections during the critical initial weeks, when Mississippi's own exposed and infected populations remain substantial, and the healthcare system risks being overwhelmed. By allocating lower traffic fractions early, the policy reduces the momentum of new seeding events into Mississippi. Over subsequent weeks, the gradual relaxation of controls allows restoration of essential economic and social mobility, which is vital for long-term sustainability. The coordinated approach across states, considering their respective infection prevalence and flow volumes, ensures that the highest risk origins like Texas receive appropriate initial restrictions, while all origins contribute to reducing overall importation pressure. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates rise, stricter or longer initial control may be warranted; conversely, if local conditions improve, relaxation can be accelerated. This strategy balances epidemic mitigation with mobility needs, leveraging temporal control dynamics for optimal public health outcomes."

This approach prioritizes stringent traffic controls during the initial weeks when epidemic importation risk is highest, effectively suppressing the seeding of new infections from states with varying infection prevalence and mobility volumes. Arizona and Texas, contributing the largest inbound flows and having significant infectious populations, necessitate strong early restrictions to reduce immediate importation risk. Mississippi and Virginia, despite lower inflows, exhibit higher infection prevalence ratios, justifying similar strict early controls to prevent outbreaks. The strategy gradually relaxes controls over subsequent weeks, harmonizing epidemic control with the imperative to restore essential mobility and economic activity. This coordinated temporal allocation reflects a risk-weighted approach that adapts to dynamic epidemic conditions and mobility demands. Sensitivity to parameter variations¡ªsuch as changes in prevalence or transmission rate (beta)¡ªreinforces the prudence of early strict controls; even small increases in infection rates or mobility could exponentially escalate imported cases. Conversely, premature relaxation risks destabilizing New Mexico's local epidemic control. Thus, the selected policy balances epidemiological prudence with socio-economic realities, leveraging cooperation across states and time to optimize health outcomes and preserve vital connectivity."

This front-loaded control limits early seeding events that could amplify local transmission in Texas, which is crucial given Texas's current high number of infected and exposed individuals. New Mexico, with low infection prevalence despite the highest inflow, is assigned a uniform control strategy to maintain balanced mobility and epidemic risk. This cooperative approach leverages temporal allocation of control intensity to minimize cumulative infections and deaths. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence rises or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter controls or prolonged durations may be needed.

Arizona and Texas, with large inflow volumes and moderate infection prevalence, are assigned the strict-first-then-relaxed strategy to sharply reduce initial imported infections and provide gradual mobility restoration. Mississippi, despite smaller inflows, has high infection prevalence, warranting early strict control to prevent seeding new infections in Virginia. New Mexico's low prevalence and smaller inflow justify a uniform moderate control, balancing epidemic control and mobility. This coordination leverages week-by-week risk dynamics and flow volumes, reducing cumulative imported infections in the crucial early period to prevent epidemic resurgence in Virginia. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early control becomes even more critical, while if prevalence decreases, more uniform or relaxed policies could be considered. This flexible, state-specific strategy maximizes public health benefits while preserving essential economic and social mobility across states."

These states pose a greater risk of importing infected individuals, necessitating the 'strict-first then relaxed' pattern to curb early seeding of new cases in Arizona. New Mexico, with low infection rates but high mobility, is assigned a uniform moderate control to balance risk and mobility needs. This cross-state coordination ensures that the overall imported infection load is minimized during the critical early weeks when Arizona's epidemic is still substantial, thereby protecting healthcare capacity and reducing mortality risk. Over time, gradual relaxation aligns with improving epidemic conditions and economic imperatives. Sensitivity to prevalence and transmission parameters (beta) highlights that if infection rates increase or transmissibility rises, earlier and stricter controls yield greater benefits. Conversely, if prevalence declines rapidly, the relaxation phase could accelerate safely. This coordinated, phased approach reflects a dynamic balance between epidemic suppression and preserving essential mobility, optimizing public health outcomes for Arizona."

The origin states vary in infection prevalence, but all present non-negligible risk, especially Texas and Virginia with higher prevalence and/or large inbound flows. Early strict controls reduce the initial imported infection pressure, crucial to prevent exacerbation of Mississippi's epidemic burden. This front-loaded containment approach leverages the first two weeks for highest control, then progressively relaxes to restore essential mobility while monitoring epidemic trends. Quantitatively, the expected imported infected cases scale with Flow * ft * (I/pop). By applying lower ft values early (0.12 and 0.21 in weeks 1 and 2), we sharply reduce imports from all origins. Later weeks have higher ft values (0.31 and 0.36), balancing epidemic control with economic and social needs. This coordinated approach across states is sensitive to changes in prevalence and transmission rates; if prevalence rises or transmissibility (beta) increases, stricter or longer-duration controls would be warranted. Conversely, if local or origin state prevalence declines, relaxation could be expedited. The strategy also preserves essential mobility by not imposing zero-flow (S2_no_control) or uniform moderate restrictions (S3_uniform), which either risk uncontrolled importation or insufficient control. Overall, the chosen policies optimally reduce the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Mississippi while sustaining critical mobility."

States with high infection prevalence and significant inflows (Arizona and Mississippi) receive front-loaded strict control (S1_strict_first_then_relaxed) to sharply reduce early importation risk when the potential for seeding new infections is highest. Texas, with a large population, moderate infection prevalence, and exceptionally high inflow, is assigned uniform controls (S3_uniform) to balance epidemic risk against critical cross-border mobility continuously, avoiding severe disruptions. Virginia, with moderate epidemic risk but low inflow, also receives front-loaded strict measures to prevent seeding while relaxing controls as risk diminishes. This coordinated approach leverages the epidemic curve dynamics and mobility volumes, applying stricter measures early when prevalence is highest and relaxing later to preserve essential economic activity. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, front-loaded strict strategies become even more critical to prevent early seeding. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or immunity rises, relaxation can be accelerated safely. Overall, this strategy balances epidemic containment with economic imperatives, optimizing health outcomes by reducing imported infections and deaths while allowing essential mobility.'

New Mexico's low infection prevalence combined with high mobility justifies a uniform control approach, balancing risk and mobility needs. This coordinated approach leverages temporal infection dynamics: strict early controls reduce initial seeding, and gradual relaxation supports economic recovery and essential movement. Sensitivity analysis suggests if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, the early strict control's importance escalates, reinforcing the need for prompt and tight restrictions.

High-risk states with higher infection prevalence and larger inflows (Texas, Arizona, Mississippi) are assigned the strict-first-then-relaxed strategy (S1), which front-loads control efforts to suppress early seeding of infections, leveraging the low ft values in the initial weeks. This reduces the effective number of infectious travelers entering Virginia during peak risk periods. New Mexico, with low infection prevalence and low inflow, uses a uniform moderate control (S3) to maintain consistent but less disruptive mitigation. This coordinated approach balances public health objectives and essential mobility by modulating restrictions according to dynamic risk profiles. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter or prolonged controls may be needed to prevent surges. Conversely, if vaccination or natural immunity rises, relaxation could accelerate. Week-by-week fractional allocations ensure the sum remains 1, preserving the intended control pattern while allowing fine-tuning for daily flows. This cooperative cross-state allocation reduces the aggregate imported infection burden and associated mortality in Virginia while sustaining critical mobility links."

High prevalence and high flow states (Texas, Mississippi) adopt the strict-first-then-relaxed strategy to sharply reduce early importation risk when Arizona's epidemic is sensitive, thereby preventing new seeding and minimizing cumulative infections and deaths. Moderate prevalence but high flow states (New Mexico) use uniform control to maintain steady mitigation without excessive disruption. Lower flow but moderate prevalence states (Virginia) also adopt uniform control to balance consistent risk management with essential mobility. This coordinated approach reduces the expected imported infected cases by modulating the flow fractions (ft) in direct proportion to infection prevalence and flow volume, leveraging the multiplicative effect of flow * ft * (I/pop). Sensitivity analyses indicate that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls would be even more critical, while if prevalence declines, gradual relaxation could be accelerated without compromising safety. The multi-week fraction patterns strategically allocate control efforts to balance epidemic suppression and socio-economic continuity, minimizing the total burden on Arizona's healthcare and economy while addressing heterogeneous risks from different origin states."

This approach leverages the epidemic dynamics: all origin states have non-negligible infected and exposed populations, with Texas and Arizona posing the highest importation risk due to their large infected populations and/or high daily inbound flows. By frontloading stricter controls (12percent and 21percent of baseline flows in the first two weeks), the policy reduces the immediate seeding of infections, allowing Mississippi's healthcare system and epidemic control measures to stabilize. As weeks progress and local containment improves, gradual relaxation (31percent and 36percent in weeks 3 and 4) restores essential mobility and economic activities, balancing public health and social needs. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stronger or prolonged restrictions may be necessary, while improvements in prevalence or vaccination coverage could allow faster relaxation. The uniform adoption of S1 across states simplifies enforcement and communication, ensuring consistent risk mitigation tailored to the combined epidemic and mobility profiles. This coordinated strategy minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi by limiting early high-risk importations while preserving mobility critical for socio-economic resilience."

Texas and Arizona represent the highest risk due to their large infected populations and substantial inbound flows to New Mexico, necessitating strict early controls to minimize imported infections. Mississippi, despite lower mobility volume, shows very high infection prevalence, justifying strict initial control to prevent disproportionate risk. Virginia's moderate risk and flow also warrant cautious initial restrictions. The chosen uniform strategy 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' across all origin states ensures a coordinated approach¡ªstringent controls early on reduce immediate importation risk, protecting New Mexico's population and healthcare capacity. Gradual relaxation over the four weeks accounts for expected decreases in prevalence and balances public health with economic and social imperatives. Quantitatively, the strategy minimizes cumulative imported infected individuals by applying the lowest flow fractions when the product of prevalence and flow would produce the highest risk. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, an even stricter early control or extended duration might be necessary. Conversely, if prevalence rapidly declines, relaxation could be accelerated. This coordinated approach across states is crucial because unilateral policies risk importing infections from less controlled origins. By synchronizing control levels and timing, New Mexico can better manage its epidemic trajectory and maintain essential mobility for critical economic and social functions."

Arizona and Virginia, with moderate prevalence and significant flows, also adopt a strict-first-then-relaxed approach to reduce cumulative infection seeding while allowing progressive mobility recovery. New Mexico, with lower infection levels but highest flow volume, employs uniform moderate control to maintain steady mitigation without undue disruption. This coordinated approach leverages temporal allocation to frontload restrictions when epidemic risks are highest, thus reducing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, maintaining or intensifying early restrictions yields better control.

Arizona, Mississippi, and Texas have relatively higher infection ratios combined with significant inbound flows, warranting strict initial traffic reductions (ft ~0.12) to sharply cut early imported infections. This is critical because early-stage importation risks exacerbating Virginia's ongoing epidemic burden (current I=30,586, E=126,980). New Mexico, with very low infection prevalence and flow, is managed with uniform moderate control, preserving steady mobility without undue epidemic risk. Week-by-week graduated relaxation aligns with expected improvements in Virginia¡¯s internal epidemic state and rising immunity, balancing disease control and socioeconomic activity. Quantitatively, imported infections scale with Flow * ft * (I/pop), so aggressive early reductions in ft for high-risk origins greatly reduce Virginia¡¯s imported case burden. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if beta (transmission rate) increases, stricter early control is even more crucial to prevent exponential spread. Conversely, if prevalence drops faster than expected, controls can be relaxed more quickly. The coordinated approach ensures that restrictions are targeted and proportional to risk, optimizing epidemic control without unduly restricting essential inflows."
