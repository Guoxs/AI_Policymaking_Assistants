Given its very high average daily inflow into New Mexico (~19,167), the potential for imported infections is significant. The imported infected estimate can be approximated as inflow * ft * (I/pop). Early strict restrictions (lower ft in initial weeks) reduce imported cases when the risk is highest, mitigating seeding events in New Mexico. Gradually relaxing control aligns with expected decreases in risk or increasing economic necessity. This strategy balances epidemiological caution with the need to preserve essential mobility, especially because Arizona's flow volume is substantial and abrupt strictness would heavily disrupt connectivity.

The strict-first-then-relaxed strategy prioritizes early control to limit initial seeding from this higher-risk origin, especially when New Mexico is still vulnerable with current infections and exposed cases.

Quantitatively, imported infections are proportional to the product of baseline inflow, control fraction ft, and infection prevalence (I/pop). Arizona and Texas, with their massive flows, pose the greatest risk despite differing infection ratios, demanding early lower ft values to suppress importation.

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic control policies focus on minimizing imported infections from the highest risk origin states while preserving essential mobility. Arizona, Mississippi, and Texas are assigned the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy due to their moderate-to-high infection ratios combined with substantial or significant inflows into New Mexico. This front-loaded strict control pattern reduces the initial importation of infections when the risk is greatest, helping to prevent seeding new outbreaks and overwhelming local health systems in New Mexico. The gradual relaxation balances epidemic control with economic recovery and mobility needs over the 4-week horizon. Virginia, with relatively low infection prevalence and minimal inflow, is assigned a uniform moderate control (S3), reflecting a lower risk profile and allowing steady mobility. This diverse strategy portfolio leverages epidemiological data and mobility patterns to efficiently allocate control efforts where they are most impactful. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase in any origin state, stricter or more prolonged controls would be warranted to avoid spikes in imported cases. Conversely, if prevalence drops or vaccine coverage improves, controls can relax sooner. Maintaining flexibility and monitoring real-time data will be essential to adapt strategies dynamically. Coordinated multi-state control efforts, as modeled here, optimize New Mexico's epidemic resilience while sustaining critical economic and social connectivity."

Arizona, Mississippi, and Texas are assigned the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy due to their moderate-to-high infection ratios combined with substantial or significant inflows into New Mexico. This front-loaded strict control pattern reduces the initial importation of infections when the risk is greatest, helping to prevent seeding new outbreaks and overwhelming local health systems in New Mexico. The gradual relaxation balances epidemic control with economic recovery and mobility needs over the 4-week horizon. Virginia, with relatively low infection prevalence and minimal inflow, is assigned a uniform moderate control (S3), reflecting a lower risk profile and allowing steady mobility. This diverse strategy portfolio leverages epidemiological data and mobility patterns to efficiently allocate control efforts where they are most impactful. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase in any origin state, stricter or more prolonged controls would be warranted to avoid spikes in imported cases. Conversely, if prevalence drops or vaccine coverage improves, controls can relax sooner. Maintaining flexibility and monitoring real-time data will be essential to adapt strategies dynamically. Coordinated multi-state control efforts, as modeled here, optimize New Mexico's epidemic resilience while sustaining critical economic and social connectivity."

    "notes": "Arizona presents a considerable epidemic risk to New Mexico due to its large population (approximately 9 million) and a substantial number of infectious individuals (I=4019) and exposed individuals (E=62035). The ratio of infected to population (~0.000448) combined with a high average daily inflow (~28077) suggests a significant potential for importing infections, roughly estimated as inflow * ft * (I/pop). Given this high risk, implementing a strict-first-then-relaxed strategy (S1) aligns with the objective to initially reduce imported infections aggressively, particularly in the critical early weeks, and then gradually relax controls to restore mobility. This pattern balances epidemic suppression with preserving essential economic and social links. The initial stricter control reduces early seeding of infections in New Mexico, while the relaxation later accommodates mobility needs once local control improves. The approach reflects a prudent trade-off between minimizing imported cases and allowing reasonable travel over time."

Despite a much smaller average daily inflow into New Mexico (~1340), the elevated infection ratio means imported cases could be impactful. The S1 strategy, featuring stricter controls initially, is justified to curb early importation risk given Mississippi¡¯s higher infection prevalence. This approach mitigates the risk of seeding new outbreaks early on while progressively restoring mobility as conditions improve or as local New Mexico immunity rises. The stricter early controls for Mississippi are particularly warranted to limit risk from a high-prevalence source, even if inflow is modest, preserving essential mobility later balances economic and social needs without compromising epidemic control."

    "notes": "Texas, with a large susceptible population (~19.5 million) and significant infected count (37,336), presents a moderate-to-high epidemic risk. The daily average inbound flow to New Mexico is very large (~151,000), making Texas the highest contributor to imported infections by volume. Using Flow * ft * (I/pop), controlling Texas inflow strictly in the first weeks reduces the absolute number of imported infections substantially. The 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy ensures initial suppression of imported cases, protecting New Mexico's epidemic status. Gradually relaxing controls aligns with expected improvements in Texas's epidemic curve, enabling essential economic and social mobility without jeopardizing public health."

    "notes": "Virginia has a moderate population (~7.5 million susceptible) and notable infected cases (28,352), with a moderate exposed number (118,386). Its daily average inbound flow to New Mexico (~1,905) is low but not negligible. Given the moderate infection prevalence, imported infections could still seed outbreaks in New Mexico. The strict-first-then-relaxed strategy reduces early imported infection risk by limiting flow to 12% initially. This approach balances the relatively smaller mobility volume with the epidemic risk. Gradual relaxation mirrors anticipated epidemic control improvements, preserving essential movement and minimizing social-economic costs."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound states present varying epidemic risks and mobility volumes. Texas and Arizona represent the highest risk due to their large infected populations and substantial inbound flows to New Mexico, necessitating strict early controls to minimize imported infections. Mississippi, despite lower mobility volume, shows very high infection prevalence, justifying strict initial control to prevent disproportionate risk. Virginia's moderate risk and flow also warrant cautious initial restrictions. The chosen uniform strategy 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' across all origin states ensures a coordinated approach¡ªstringent controls early on reduce immediate importation risk, protecting New Mexico's population and healthcare capacity. Gradual relaxation over the four weeks accounts for expected decreases in prevalence and balances public health with economic and social imperatives. Quantitatively, the strategy minimizes cumulative imported infected individuals by applying the lowest flow fractions when the product of prevalence and flow would produce the highest risk. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, an even stricter early control or extended duration might be necessary. Conversely, if prevalence rapidly declines, relaxation could be accelerated. This coordinated approach across states is crucial because unilateral policies risk importing infections from less controlled origins. By synchronizing control levels and timing, New Mexico can better manage its epidemic trajectory and maintain essential mobility for critical economic and social functions."
