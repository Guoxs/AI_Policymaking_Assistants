The inbound flow from Mississippi to Arizona averages around 1586 daily, which results in a significant potential for imported infections when combined with this prevalence and mobility volume. Using the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/pop), stricter controls in the early weeks (ft lower) will reduce initial seeding into Arizona, limiting early outbreak amplification. The S1_strict_first_then_relaxed strategy, which imposes stricter control early (12% of flow, then gradually relaxing), balances the need to reduce importation risk during the most critical period while relaxing later to preserve essential mobility. This approach is prudent given Mississippi's moderate infection load and flow volume, prioritizing epidemic control first while allowing gradual mobility recovery."

New Mexico, with moderately elevated prevalence and very high flow, is managed with a mid-level steady control to balance epidemic mitigation and essential mobility. Texas, with low prevalence but very high flow, is assigned a mid-relaxed pattern to preserve economic and social activity while maintaining moderate infection import risk control. This cooperative approach distributes controls to reduce the overall imported infection pressure across weeks and states, preventing overwhelming local cases and deaths in Arizona.

The exposed population (E=15215) further amplifies this potential for transmission. The average daily inbound flow to Arizona from Mississippi is moderate (~2696), so importation risk is meaningful but not extreme. Import risk can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I/pop), which remains elevated given the high infection prevalence (~0.00115). Consequently, a strategy with strict controls initially (low ft in week 1) reduces immediate importation risk when Arizona's local incidence is still concerning, then relaxes controls gradually to balance essential mobility needs. This phased approach aligns with Mississippi's epidemiological profile, mitigating imported cases upfront while accommodating economic and social mobility over time.

Given the low prevalence but high mobility, a mid-strict pattern that imposes moderate control uniformly but with slightly stronger restrictions in the middle weeks balances risk and mobility. This pattern helps to dampen any emerging outbreaks in New Mexico without imposing severe restrictions that could unnecessarily hinder essential travel.

This approach maintains essential economic and social links while protecting Arizona by preventing any unnoticed exponential growth of infections through imported cases."

Coupled with a moderate inflow of 2284 daily travelers to Arizona, the importation risk is non-negligible. The imported infected estimate is roughly Flow * ft * (I/pop). Early weeks require stricter control to minimize initial seeding of infections in Arizona, which justifies the strict first then relaxed pattern (S1). This strategy allows mobility to recover gradually as the risk diminishes over time or as local Arizona controls strengthen. The trade-off balances minimizing initial importation while not overly restricting essential mobility long-term, supporting economic and social needs. Given Mississippi's moderate-to-high infection rate and moderate inflow, a front-loaded strict control reduces early epidemic impact on Arizona efficiently."

The S4 strategy balances maintaining essential mobility to support Arizona¡¯s economy while mitigating consistent risk of importation.
