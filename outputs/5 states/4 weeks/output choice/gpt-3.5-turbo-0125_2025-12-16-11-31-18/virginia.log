Choosing 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' enables strict inbound traffic control initially to reduce immediate imported infections, then relaxes over time. This is justified as Arizona has moderate but non-negligible infections; stricter early control can prevent seeding new cases in Virginia's vulnerable population while allowing gradual mobility restoration. This balances epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia without overly restricting flow from Arizona long-term."

The 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy is appropriate, imposing strict control in the first weeks to reduce immediate seeding while allowing phased reopening as Virginia's internal controls improve. This approach carefully balances mobility with epidemic suppression, preventing early spikes in imported cases that could overwhelm Virginia's epidemic control."

New Mexico, with moderate infection prevalence and smaller inflow, receives mid-level strict control ('S4_mid_strict') to balance mitigation and mobility. Texas, with a large population but very low infected ratio, is assigned a more relaxed policy ('S5_mid_relaxed') to maintain essential mobility with minimal epidemic risk.

The inbound flow from Arizona to Virginia is relatively high at 5763.29 daily, which combined with a moderate infection prevalence (I/pop ~0.000106), suggests a meaningful risk of importing infections. Applying the S1_strict_first_then_relaxed strategy with initially strict controls (low ft in week 1) reduces early importation risk when Virginia is vulnerable, while gradually relaxing controls aligns with improving epidemic conditions or vaccination progress. This balances epidemic risk and mobility needs by prioritizing strict control initially to prevent seeding infections, then allowing increased mobility to support economic and social activity.

The S1_strict_first_then_relaxed strategy allows Virginia to strongly limit infected importation from Mississippi's substantial infectious population at the outset, then progressively ease controls to balance socio-economic needs.

The inflow from Arizona is relatively high (6712.52 daily), which could lead to substantial imported infections if uncontrolled. The imported infected estimate is roughly proportional to Flow * ft * (I/pop), so initially strict control reduces early risk.

The daily inflow is moderate (5483.38) but the high infected ratio increases the risk of importing cases into Virginia. The imported infected estimate (Flow * ft * I/pop) is thus substantial, demanding strong early traffic restrictions. The S1_strict_first_then_relaxed strategy imposes strict control initially (ft=0.12) to sharply reduce incoming infection pressure, then progressively relaxes control to balance economic and social mobility needs.

Given this lower risk profile, a mid-relaxed traffic control strategy (S5_mid_relaxed) is suitable, allowing more normalized mobility while maintaining moderate caution through the 4 weeks. This strategy supports slightly relaxed traffic controls in weeks 2 and 3 (ft=0.30), with somewhat stricter control in weeks 1 and 4 to buffer potential epidemic fluctuations.

Coupled with a very high daily inflow of 28664.38, the potential for imported infections to Virginia is significant. The calculation of imported infected cases as Flow * ft * (I/pop) suggests that early, strict traffic control can substantially reduce infection importation. Thus, the S1_strict_first_then_relaxed strategy is chosen to strongly limit mobility from Texas initially (ft=0.12), then gradually relax controls to balance epidemic control and economic mobility. This staged approach aligns with Virginia¡¯s goal to minimize cumulative cases and deaths while allowing essential transportation and commerce over time. Early strict measures are crucial due to Texas's high inflow and moderate infection prevalence, ensuring Virginia¡¯s epidemic burden is not exacerbated."

  "global_guidance": "The overall inbound traffic control strategy for Virginia prioritizes minimizing imported infections from states with higher infection prevalence and/or larger inflows. Arizona, Mississippi, and Texas, due to their combination of moderate-to-high infected prevalence and substantial daily inflows, are managed with the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy, imposing strong early restrictions to sharply reduce infection importation during the most critical initial weeks. This aligns with the epidemiological principle of early containment, reducing cumulative exposed and infected cases in Virginia. New Mexico, with its low infection prevalence and smaller inflow, is assigned a more relaxed 'S5_mid_relaxed' strategy to maintain essential mobility and economic activity without significant epidemic risk. Importantly, the cumulative fractions in each strategy sum to 1, ensuring total inbound flow preservation while modulating weekly distributions to optimize epidemic control. This coordinated approach across states leverages temporal control intensity variations to manage risk dynamically, reducing initial seeding while enabling phased mobility recovery. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) increases in any origin state, stricter early controls would become more imperative; conversely, if prevalence decreases, relaxation could be accelerated.

The infection prevalence ratio (I/pop) is approximately 0.00073, which coupled with a large average daily inbound flow into Virginia (5618.52) suggests a significant risk of importing infections.

Applying the same quantitative infection-import logic (Flow * ft * (I/pop)) shows that even moderate mobility can result in significant case importation. The 'strict first then relaxed' strategy (S1) is justified as it initially suppresses mobility from Mississippi to limit early imported infections when risk is highest, then gradually relaxes as Virginia¡¯s local epidemic is managed. This strategy optimally balances the risk of importation and the need to maintain essential mobility, reducing the likelihood of triggering Virginia¡¯s epidemic resurgence."

  "global_guidance": "The overall inbound traffic control strategy for Virginia prioritizes early strict restrictions on states with higher infected populations and/or high inbound traffic volumes, specifically Arizona, Mississippi, and Texas. These states pose the greatest risk of importing infections due to either large infected populations or substantial traffic volume. The S1_strict_first_then_relaxed strategy is effective in these cases to minimize early seeding of new cases and deaths in Virginia by sharply reducing inbound infected cases initially, then gradually relaxing controls to resume essential mobility. For New Mexico, with lower infection prevalence and smaller traffic volumes, a more relaxed mid-level strategy (S5_mid_relaxed) balances epidemic control and mobility preservation. This cross-state approach reduces cumulative imported infections by focusing controls where risk is greatest, while allowing controlled mobility from lower-risk origins. Sensitivity to infection prevalence and transmission rates (beta) supports this dynamic strategy: if prevalence rises or beta increases, stricter early controls become even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence declines, the strategy allows faster relaxation to support economic and social activity. By coordinating control levels and timing across origin states, Virginia can effectively reduce epidemic spread while maintaining essential inbound mobility, optimizing public health and economic outcomes concurrently."

These states pose the greatest risk of importing infections due to either large infected populations or substantial traffic volume. The S1_strict_first_then_relaxed strategy is effective in these cases to minimize early seeding of new cases and deaths in Virginia by sharply reducing inbound infected cases initially, then gradually relaxing controls to resume essential mobility. For New Mexico, with lower infection prevalence and smaller traffic volumes, a more relaxed mid-level strategy (S5_mid_relaxed) balances epidemic control and mobility preservation. This cross-state approach reduces cumulative imported infections by focusing controls where risk is greatest, while allowing controlled mobility from lower-risk origins. Sensitivity to infection prevalence and transmission rates (beta) supports this dynamic strategy: if prevalence rises or beta increases, stricter early controls become even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence declines, the strategy allows faster relaxation to support economic and social activity. By coordinating control levels and timing across origin states, Virginia can effectively reduce epidemic spread while maintaining essential inbound mobility, optimizing public health and economic outcomes concurrently.'
