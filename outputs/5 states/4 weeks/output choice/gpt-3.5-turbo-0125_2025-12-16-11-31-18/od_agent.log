States with higher prevalence and significant flows, such as Mississippi and Virginia, receive the strict-first-then-relaxed pattern to sharply reduce early importations when epidemic seeding is most impactful. New Mexico, with moderately elevated prevalence and very high flow, is managed with a mid-level steady control to balance epidemic mitigation and essential mobility. Texas, with low prevalence but very high flow, is assigned a mid-relaxed pattern to preserve economic and social activity while maintaining moderate infection import risk control. This cooperative approach distributes controls to reduce the overall imported infection pressure across weeks and states, preventing overwhelming local cases and deaths in Arizona. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) were to rise, earlier and stricter controls would be warranted, especially for high-flow states, to maintain epidemic control. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta is reduced through vaccination or NPIs, controls can be relaxed sooner to enhance mobility. This strategy mix is designed to be dynamically adaptable, minimizing epidemic risk while preserving essential interstate mobility for Arizona's socioeconomic stability."

States with higher infection prevalence relative to their population, such as New Mexico and Virginia, receive stricter early restrictions via the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy to curtail initial importation risk. Arizona, with moderate prevalence, follows a similar phased approach, recognizing its contribution to imported infections but balancing mobility needs. Texas, characterized by very low infection prevalence but high traffic volume, uses a mid-strict uniform approach ('S4_mid_strict') to moderate risk while preserving critical flow. This coordinated approach ensures that high-risk inflows are tightly controlled initially, reducing the probability of seeding new outbreaks in Mississippi, while lower-risk, high-volume origins maintain balanced flow to support economic vitality. Weekly fraction allocations aligned with each strategy maintain consistent control patterns, facilitating policy implementation and public compliance. Sensitivity to epidemic parameters (e.g., transmission rate beta) suggests that if local prevalence or infectiousness increases, stricter controls or front-loaded strategies might be required across all states to prevent exponential growth. Conversely, if prevalence declines or vaccination coverage improves, controls can be progressively relaxed, emphasizing adaptive management. Overall, this strategy prioritizes health security while sustaining essential interstate connectivity, crucial for Mississippi¡¯s epidemic resilience and socio-economic stability."

Texas, despite low prevalence, has very high travel volume necessitating a mid-strict balanced approach (S4) to maintain essential mobility while controlling gradual importation risk. Quantitatively, imported infected cases are proportional to inflow * fraction * (I/pop), so adjusting ft in each week modifies importation risk dynamically. Early weeks see low fractions to curb seeding, with gradual relaxation as local controls and immunity build. Coordination across states ensures cumulative imported infections remain minimized, avoiding overwhelming local healthcare. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence in origin states increases or transmission rate (beta) rises, stricter or more prolonged controls become necessary to prevent resurgence. Conversely, if prevalence declines or vaccination coverage improves, more relaxed strategies may be viable. This policy balances epidemic control and socioeconomic needs, leveraging state-specific risk profiles and travel patterns to protect New Mexico's population."

States with higher infection prevalence and substantial inflow, such as Mississippi and New Mexico, receive moderate to mid-level restrictions to balance epidemic control and essential movement. Arizona and Virginia, having moderate infection levels but significant inflow, employ initially strict controls to reduce early importation risk, gradually relaxing as local epidemic conditions improve. This phased approach across states leverages temporal control variations to prevent synchronized surges of imported cases that could overwhelm Texas' healthcare capacity. The chosen strategies collectively reduce the expected imported infected cases approximately proportional to the product of origin state's infection prevalence, inflow, and control factor ft applied week-wise. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission parameters (beta) increase, stricter early controls and longer duration of reduced mobility would be necessary to maintain manageable importation risk. Conversely, lower prevalence or improved local immunity in Texas would allow more relaxed control. Coordination across weeks and states ensures a sustainable epidemic-mobility trade-off, preserving essential economic and social activities while controlling disease spread."

New Mexico, with moderate infection prevalence and smaller inflow, receives mid-level strict control ('S4_mid_strict') to balance mitigation and mobility. Texas, with a large population but very low infected ratio, is assigned a more relaxed policy ('S5_mid_relaxed') to maintain essential mobility with minimal epidemic risk. Week-by-week allocation fractions maintain consistent strategy patterns, ensuring the timing of restrictions aligns with epidemic dynamics and policy goals. Sensitivity analysis suggests if infection prevalence increases or transmission parameters (beta) rise, stricter controls may be warranted earlier or extended longer to suppress imported infections.

States with higher infection prevalence or substantial infected populations (Mississippi and Texas) adopt stricter or consistently moderate controls to reduce imported infections early and throughout the control period. States with low prevalence but high mobility (New Mexico) receive more relaxed controls to maintain critical connectivity while still mitigating risk. Virginia, with moderate prevalence and lower flow, follows a strict-first-then-relaxed pattern to prevent initial importation spikes. This coordinated approach minimizes cumulative imported infections and deaths in Arizona by concentrating stringent controls when risk is highest and relaxing them when risk diminishes or mobility needs peak. Sensitivity to prevalence and flow is key: if infection rates rise in any origin state, stricter strategies would be warranted; conversely, if beta (transmission rate) decreases due to interventions, more relaxed policies could be safe. Weekly allocation patterns reflect changing epidemic dynamics and mobility demands, ensuring dynamic, data-driven epidemic control with minimal disruption to essential travel."

For states with moderate to low infection prevalence but significant inflow (Arizona, New Mexico, Virginia), S1_strict_first_then_relaxed is chosen to impose early stringent controls, reducing initial seeding events when Mississippi is vulnerable due to its current infected population (I=3,831). This phased relaxation protects essential mobility while progressively lowering importation risk as conditions improve. Texas, with the highest inflow and moderate prevalence, is assigned a mid-strict uniform pattern (S4_mid_strict) to sustain consistent control, reflecting the continuous importation risk due to sheer volume. The quantitative logic uses imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/pop), evidencing that early strict control in high-risk states significantly lowers imported infectious individuals. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if beta (transmission rate) or prevalence increases, stricter or more prolonged controls may be necessary, especially for high-volume states like Texas. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, mobility could be relaxed more rapidly. Coordination across weeks and states ensures that importation pressure is balanced against mobility needs, optimizing epidemic control in Mississippi by reducing cumulative cases and deaths while preserving essential economic and social functions.'

Arizona and Mississippi have been assigned strict-first-then-relaxed strategies (S1) due to their combination of moderate to high infection levels and, in Arizona¡¯s case, substantial inbound flow. This reduces initial importation risk during critical early weeks. Texas, with its extremely high inbound flow but moderate infection levels, receives a mid-strict strategy (S4) to ensure continuous but controlled mobility, minimizing sudden economic disruptions while controlling spread. Virginia¡¯s lower inbound flow and moderate infection risk justify a mid-relaxed strategy (S5) to maintain essential travel and economic activity. This coordinated approach leverages time-phased control to reduce risk when it is highest and ease restrictions as the epidemic stabilizes, optimizing the trade-off between epidemic control and mobility. Sensitivity analyses indicate that increases in infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) would warrant shifting more states toward stricter early controls, while decreases would allow more relaxation. The selected strategies, therefore, provide a flexible yet robust framework to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico by carefully modulating imported infections through targeted traffic control.'

States with higher infection prevalence and large travel volumes to Texas, such as Mississippi and Arizona, receive the strictest initial controls ('S1_strict_first_then_relaxed') to sharply reduce early importation of infected individuals. This front-loaded restriction helps limit seeding events that could amplify local outbreaks in Texas. New Mexico, with moderate infections but high flow, is assigned a mid-strict strategy ('S4_mid_strict') that balances control with mobility, reducing risk while preserving economic activity. Virginia's lower travel volume and moderate infection levels justify a more relaxed strategy ('S5_mid_relaxed'), conserving resources and mobility where risk is lower. Across weeks, the allocation patterns prioritize stricter early controls to curb initial imported infections, then gradually relax to restore mobility, reflecting epidemiological dynamics and economic considerations. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase in any origin, stricter control proportions should be reallocated to those states to prevent epidemic escalation. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, controls can be safely relaxed earlier. This coordinated multi-state approach reduces cumulative imported cases and deaths in Texas effectively, while sustaining critical inbound flows for economic and social stability."

This reduces the immediate risk of importing infected individuals into Virginia when its own epidemic is still active, thus minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. For New Mexico, with low infection prevalence and smaller inflow, a mid-relaxed strategy maintains essential mobility with acceptable risk. The strategy selection leverages the weekly fraction patterns to frontload restrictions, allowing later easing as Virginia¡¯s epidemic is expected to improve. This temporal allocation reduces peak imported infections early while preserving economic and social interactions over the month. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase in origin states or Virginia, the benefits of early strict control would be amplified, emphasizing the importance of dynamic, data-driven traffic policies. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed strategies could be feasible. Overall, the cross-state coordination of inbound traffic control balances epidemic suppression and mobility preservation, optimizing public health outcomes and economic stability for Virginia.'

States with higher prevalence and/or larger inflow (Texas, Mississippi) adopt 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategies, imposing stronger initial restrictions to curb early importation risk when Arizona's local epidemic is still sensitive. States with lower prevalence but significant flow (New Mexico, Virginia) receive 'S4_mid_strict' strategies, applying moderate but consistent control to balance epidemic risk and mobility needs. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections are proportional to the product of flow volume, infection prevalence, and control fraction ft; thus, frontloading stricter control in high-risk states reduces early seeding of cases. This coordinated approach lessens pressure on Arizona's healthcare system and buys time to improve local control measures. Sensitivity to epidemiological parameters such as transmission rate (beta) and latent period (alpha) means that if prevalence increases or beta rises, stricter controls or prolonged application may be necessary to prevent surges. Conversely, if local Arizona conditions improve or vaccination rates rise, controls can be relaxed faster. This adaptive, risk-based traffic allocation strategy optimizes public health protection while maintaining critical economic and social connectivity."

Virginia, with higher prevalence but moderate flow, receives a more balanced mid-strict control (S4) to maintain steady risk mitigation without overly restricting mobility. This coordinated approach minimizes cumulative imported infections by front-loading restrictions where needed and gradually relaxing them as local conditions improve, preserving essential economic and social activity. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) increase, stricter early controls become even more critical, especially for high-flow states. Conversely, if prevalence declines, gradual relaxation can be faster to support mobility.

States with either high relative infection prevalence but low flow (Mississippi) or moderate infection risk and low flow (Virginia) are assigned the mid-strict strategy (S4), balancing epidemic control and mobility preservation. This cooperative approach reduces cumulative imported infections by applying early strict control where risks are highest and allowing gradual relaxation to restore mobility and economic activity. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence increases or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early controls become even more crucial.

States with higher infection prevalence and significant daily inflows such as Mississippi and Arizona are subject to the strict-first-then-relaxed strategy to aggressively suppress early importation risk, mitigating potential epidemic seeding in Texas. New Mexico, with low prevalence but high inflow, benefits from a mid-relaxed strategy that balances low epidemiological risk with the need for sustained economic and social connections. Virginia's moderate prevalence and inflow justify a mid-strict strategy that tempers traffic particularly during mid-period weeks, targeting peak transmission risk windows. The quantitative infection-import logic informs these decisions, using the product of daily inflow, weekly control fraction, and infected population fraction to estimate imported infections. Coordination across weeks and states ensures that control intensity and timing are optimized collectively to prevent overwhelming Texas's healthcare capacity. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates rise in any origin state, stricter controls or earlier implementation would be warranted to prevent imported case surges. Conversely, reductions in prevalence or improved epidemic control in origin states could allow more relaxed policies. This framework dynamically balances epidemic control with economic and social mobility imperatives, ensuring Texas's epidemic trajectory is favorably managed while minimizing unnecessary travel disruptions."

States with higher infection prevalence and/or higher inflow volumes, such as Mississippi, Arizona, and Texas, are assigned the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy to enforce stricter control in early weeks when imported infections could seed local outbreaks. This front-loaded strict control reduces the initial influx of infected individuals, which is critical given Virginia's current moderate infection levels. New Mexico, with low prevalence and smaller inflow, is assigned a more relaxed mid pattern (S5_mid_relaxed) to maintain mobility with some caution. The sum of these policies balances epidemic risk across all origin states while considering the essential movement of people and goods. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if prevalence increases or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter or more prolonged controls would be necessary. Conversely, if prevalence drops or vaccination reduces susceptibility, controls could be relaxed earlier. The chosen traffic allocation patterns reflect this dynamic balance, reducing expected imported infections linearly with the product of flow, control fraction, and infection prevalence. Effective coordination across weeks and states ensures that imported infections are minimized during the most vulnerable phase of Virginia's epidemic curve, supporting overall epidemic control without excessive disruption to mobility."

New Mexico's very high flow but low prevalence justifies a mid-strict approach to carefully balance risk and mobility. Virginia's lower flow and moderate prevalence allow for a more relaxed approach, conserving mobility for essential needs. Across weeks, the strategies modulate control intensity to front-load restrictions when risk is highest, then relax as internal and external epidemics improve. The cumulative imported infected cases are roughly proportional to flow * ft * (I/pop), so lowering ft early in high-risk states reduces overall importation substantially. Sensitivity analysis shows that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls would be even more critical to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence drops faster than expected, the policies can be relaxed sooner to restore mobility. This coordinated, data-driven approach balances epidemic control with economic and social needs, minimizing Arizona's cumulative confirmed and deceased cases while preserving essential traffic."

The chosen strategies reflect a nuanced assessment of each origin state's infectious prevalence and mobility volumes. States with moderate to low prevalence but smaller inflows (Arizona, New Mexico, Virginia) are assigned the strict-first-then-relaxed strategy, leveraging early stringent control to prevent seeding events and then progressively relaxing to support economic activity. Texas, with its higher prevalence and large inbound volume, is assigned a mid-strict strategy to balance substantial risk with mobility needs. This coordinated approach optimizes cumulative risk reduction by front-loading control where it is most impactful and easing restrictions as local conditions improve and imported risk diminishes. The relative fractions within strategies ensure weekly allocations sum to one, maintaining consistency with predefined patterns. Sensitivity analyses indicate that increases in beta or prevalence would heighten the importance of early strict controls; conversely, reductions in these parameters could allow for more uniform or relaxed approaches. Cross-state cooperation in traffic control timing and intensity is critical, as imported infections from multiple sources compound risks. This strategy ensemble leverages epidemiological data and mobility baselines to mitigate transmission importation effectively while preserving vital economic and social connections."

This leverages the observation that early-stage importations have a disproportionate effect on local epidemic trajectories. By contrast, for Virginia, where both prevalence and inflow are lower, a uniform control strategy avoids unnecessary disruption while maintaining steady epidemic mitigation. This cross-state approach optimizes the trade-off between epidemic control and essential mobility, recognizing that imported infected individuals scale with the product of prevalence, inflow, and control fraction. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, maintaining stricter controls early is even more critical. Conversely, if local New Mexico control improves or external prevalence drops, gradual relaxation can be accelerated. Weekly fraction distributions were chosen to align exactly with predefined strategy patterns, ensuring policy clarity and operational feasibility. This coordinated multi-state inbound control reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths in New Mexico while preserving vital economic and social connectivity.'

Mississippi, with the highest infected fraction and substantial inflow, receives the strictest early control to reduce imported cases sharply. Arizona and Virginia, while having lower infection fractions, still present moderate risk due to population sizes and inbound flows; thus, they also follow the strict-first-then-relaxed pattern to mitigate early transmission risk. New Mexico, characterized by low infection prevalence but the highest inbound flow, is managed with a mid-strict approach balancing moderate control with essential mobility. This coordinated approach reduces imported infection pressure in the critical early weeks, preventing seeding events in Texas, while progressively relaxing controls to restore economic and social activities. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls would yield larger benefits in case reduction. Conversely, if local Texas conditions improve substantially, more relaxed allocations could be considered. This strategy reflects a data-driven, adaptive balance between epidemic containment and mobility preservation across origin states.'

Mississippi's high prevalence and moderate flow warranted stringent early restrictions to prevent significant imported infections. Arizona and Texas, with moderate prevalence and large flows, also adopt strict-first policies to reduce seeding risk. New Mexico, with low prevalence and minimal flow, follows a mid-relaxed strategy allowing more mobility. This heterogeneous approach balances epidemic risk and mobility needs across origin states, reducing cumulative infections and deaths in Virginia. Week-by-week allocation accounting for prevalence and flow magnitude optimizes control impact while preserving essential movement. Sensitivity to infection prevalence and transmission rates (beta) suggests that if prevalence rises or beta increases, stricter early controls or extended durations may be necessary. Conversely, if prevalence drops or vaccination improves, further relaxation could be feasible earlier. This strategy also accounts for the lag in epidemic dynamics, emphasizing front-loaded controls to blunt initial importation risk. Coordinated traffic policies across states ensure that no single origin overwhelms Virginia's defenses, distributing control efforts effectively for maximal epidemiological benefit."

States with high infection prevalence and/or large inbound flow (Texas and Mississippi) are assigned a strict-first-then-relaxed strategy to sharply reduce initial imported infections, protecting Arizona's vulnerable epidemic state early on. States with low prevalence but high inflow (New Mexico) or moderate prevalence and lower flow (Virginia) receive a mid-strict strategy, maintaining moderate control to reduce importation risk while enabling critical mobility and economic activity. This cross-state cooperation limits cumulative imported infections and deaths by frontloading restrictions where risk is highest, while allowing gradual relaxation as local epidemic control improves. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase in origin states, stricter or longer initial control would be warranted, emphasizing the importance of timely epidemic surveillance to adjust policies dynamically. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, relaxing controls sooner could optimize economic recovery with minimal health risk. Overall, this coordinated, data-driven approach minimizes Arizona's epidemic burden through targeted, temporally phased traffic allocation, respecting both health imperatives and mobility needs."

States with low infection prevalence and moderate inbound flows, such as Arizona and New Mexico, adopt the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy to sharply reduce imported cases early on, thereby protecting Mississippi's currently high infection burden. Texas, with the highest infection prevalence and inbound flow, receives a 'S4_mid_strict' strategy to apply moderate but sustained control, targeting peak transmission periods to prevent overwhelming Mississippi¡¯s healthcare resources. Virginia's intermediate risk justifies a 'S5_mid_relaxed' approach, allowing flexible controls that respond dynamically to evolving epidemiological conditions. Collectively, these strategies minimize imported infections by front-loading restrictions where risk is highest and relaxing controls where feasible to maintain economic and social connectivity. If prevalence or transmission rates change, strategies can be adapted; for example, increased beta or I would warrant earlier or more stringent controls. Coordinated timing of controls across states also reduces cumulative risk, as early restrictions in high-prevalence states decrease seeding potential downstream. Sensitivity to assumptions about infection detection rates and mobility patterns is vital, suggesting continuous monitoring and adaptive policy refinement."

These states show varied infection ratios but combined with their significant mobility volumes, especially Texas and Arizona, they represent the highest risks. Applying the S1 strict-first-then-relaxed strategy to these states ensures that New Mexico reduces the influx of infected travelers during the critical initial weeks when these importations could exacerbate local outbreaks. For Virginia, with moderate prevalence and low inflow, the uniform strategy balances epidemic risk and mobility without imposing unnecessary strict restrictions. The weekly distribution of fractions respects the relative severity of each state's epidemic risk and mobility volume, optimizing the epidemic-mobility trade-off. Sensitivity to parameters such as beta (transmission rate) and prevalence is acknowledged¡ªif transmission or prevalence rises, stricter early controls yield greater benefits. Conversely, if local New Mexico control improves or vaccination coverage increases, gradual relaxation is justified. This cooperative multi-state approach reduces total expected infections and deaths while preserving essential economic and social connectivity."

This coordinated approach minimizes cumulative imported infections and deaths by reducing early exposure when Texas' own infected population remains significant. The initial strict control periods correspond to lower ft values, cutting down effective inbound infected travelers as computed by flow * ft * (I/pop). Later relaxation phases balance epidemic control with the preservation of essential economic and social mobility, preventing prolonged economic disruption. The high inbound flow from New Mexico, coupled with its low infection prevalence, justifies a more relaxed strategy allowing more consistent mobility with moderate control. Sensitivity to changes in local beta or prevalence would warrant adjusting the strictness or timing of controls; for example, higher transmissibility or rising prevalence in origin states would push towards stricter or longer control phases. This multi-state coordinated traffic control plan effectively reduces Texas' cumulative epidemic burden while maintaining vital mobility."

This approach minimizes cumulative imported infections by front-loading restrictions when infection seeding risk is highest, thus reducing secondary transmission and deaths in Virginia. The strict-first-then-relaxed pattern enables a strategic balance, reducing epidemic risk in initial weeks when importation impact is greatest, while progressively restoring essential mobility to support socio-economic needs. Quantitatively, imported infected individuals are proportional to the product of inflow, control fraction, and infection prevalence (I/population). Coordinated allocation reduces expected importation by lowering control fractions (ft) for higher-risk states early on. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, maintaining strict early controls becomes more critical to suppress importation risk. Conversely, if prevalence drops, gradual relaxation could be accelerated. The policy framework allows adaptive control responsive to changing epidemic dynamics while preserving essential inter-state connectivity, aiming to minimize Virginia's cumulative confirmed cases and deaths through considered, data-driven traffic management."

States with higher infection prevalence and/or larger inbound flows, such as Mississippi and Texas, receive the 'strict first then relaxed' strategy to aggressively reduce early imported infections, leveraging front-loaded restrictions to quickly curb potential epidemic seeding. States with lower infection prevalence or smaller inbound flows, like New Mexico and Virginia, are assigned the 'mid strict' strategy to maintain moderate, consistent controls that balance epidemic safety with ongoing essential travel. This coordinated approach ensures that cumulative imported infections and consequent disease burden in Arizona are minimized across the 4-week horizon. Quantitatively, imported infected cases scale with the product of flow, control fraction (ft), and infection prevalence (I/pop). By adjusting ft across weeks, the policy optimizes reductions in initial high-risk periods while allowing gradual relaxation to sustain economic and social activity. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter or longer-lasting controls may be warranted, especially for high-flow states. Conversely, reductions in prevalence could allow more uniform or relaxed strategies. Overall, this strategy set reflects a nuanced balance between epidemiological risk management and preserving critical mobility pathways essential for Arizona's economy and connectedness."

Early strict controls (lower ft values in week 1 and 2) across all origins reduce the initial seeding of infections into Mississippi, which currently has a significant exposed and infected population. This coordinated approach minimizes cumulative imported infections and deaths by suppressing early importation risk when Mississippi's susceptible population is large and vulnerable. Gradually relaxing controls in later weeks supports economic and social mobility recovery, preventing prolonged disruption. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or beta increase, early strict controls become even more critical to avoid overwhelming local healthcare. Conversely, if prevalence declines or beta decreases, the phased relaxation preserves mobility without compromising epidemic control. The uniform strategy simplifies implementation and ensures equitable risk management across diverse origins with varying epidemic dynamics and mobility volumes. This balanced policy effectively mitigates imported infection risk while maintaining essential travel and commerce flows."

The S1_strict_first_then_relaxed pattern frontloads strict controls, reducing the product Flow * ft * (I/pop) during the critical early weeks, thus limiting imported infections and potential secondary outbreaks. For Virginia, with lower flow and moderate infection levels, the mid-strict uniform approach (S4) provides a balanced trade-off, sustaining essential mobility without risking sharp increases in imported cases. This coordinated multi-state approach collectively reduces the expected number of imported infections and deaths by frontloading control efforts on the highest risk routes, while gradually relaxing them to preserve economic and social activity. Sensitivity considerations include that if beta (transmission rate) or prevalence in origin states increase, stricter early controls become more necessary to prevent overwhelming New Mexico¡¯s healthcare capacity. Conversely, if prevalence drops or New Mexico¡¯s local epidemic worsens, inbound controls may need adjustment to prevent further epidemic seeding. The chosen strategies incorporate these dynamics by tailoring control levels to origin risk and flow magnitude, ensuring effective epidemic-mobility balance across the 28-day horizon.'

States with high infection prevalence, such as Mississippi, receive the strictest early controls (S1) to sharply reduce imported cases when Texas's local infections remain high. Moderate risk states like Arizona also follow S1 to balance early epidemic containment with gradual relaxation. Low-prevalence, high-flow states like New Mexico adopt a mid-relaxed approach (S5), leveraging their low risk to maintain mobility without significantly raising Texas¡¯s epidemic burden. Virginia¡¯s moderate risk and flow justify a mid-strict strategy (S4) with focused controls during vulnerable Texas epidemic phases. Quantitatively, the imported infected estimate (Flow * ft * (I/pop)) guides the control intensity, prioritizing states contributing the largest infection import risk. Week-by-week allocation strategies balance early suppression of imported infections with later mobility restoration, critical for economic and social stability. Sensitivity to parameters such as infection prevalence and transmission rate (beta) is high; increasing prevalence or beta would warrant more stringent early controls, while reductions may allow relaxation. This coordinated, data-driven approach optimizes epidemic control and mobility preservation in Texas during the next 4 weeks."

States with higher infection prevalence and/or large inbound flows (Mississippi, Texas, Arizona) warrant the strict-first-then-relaxed (S1) strategy to sharply reduce early import risk when Virginia's epidemic burden is significant. This front-loaded control lowers cumulative imported cases by addressing the highest risk period immediately. New Mexico, with low infection prevalence and smaller flow, uses a mid-relaxed strategy (S5) that maintains essential mobility without markedly increasing risk. This portfolio of strategies balances epidemiological control with economic and social mobility needs. The cooperation logic is that stricter early controls on high-risk origins reduce the seeding of new infections into Virginia, limiting epidemic amplification. Relaxation in later weeks adapts to evolving epidemic dynamics and allows economic recovery. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase in origin states, stricter controls earlier become even more critical, whereas lower prevalence allows more relaxed policies. This adaptive, risk-based inbound allocation framework optimizes epidemic suppression while preserving essential cross-state mobility."

States with higher infection prevalence and/or inflow (Texas and Mississippi) adopt strict-first strategies (S1) to reduce early epidemic seeding in Arizona, critical given Arizona's current moderate infection and exposed population. New Mexico, with low prevalence but very high inflow, adopts a mid-strict uniform approach (S4) to balance ongoing importation risk with mobility needs. Virginia, having moderate prevalence but low inflow, receives a more relaxed mid-relaxed strategy (S5) to preserve essential mobility while managing risk. This distribution reduces cumulative imported infections and consequent deaths in Arizona by front-loading controls where risk is highest, while allowing gradual relaxation or steadier flows where risk is moderate or low. Week-by-week modulation considers incubation and infectious periods, decreasing imported infections during peak contagiousness. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase in origin states, stricter controls earlier would become more critical to prevent imported outbreaks. Conversely, if beta or prevalence decreases, relaxation could be accelerated to support mobility. This coordinated multi-state approach leverages infection prevalence, flow volume, and Arizona¡¯s epidemic status to optimize epidemic control and socio-economic resilience."

Texas, with the highest infection prevalence and inflow volume, receives the strictest early control (S1_strict_first_then_relaxed) to reduce initial imported infections, thereby protecting Mississippi's already high infected population. Arizona also receives strict early controls due to moderate prevalence and inflow, mitigating early importation risk. New Mexico, with lower prevalence and inflow, is managed with a mid-strict strategy balancing control and mobility, while Virginia's moderate epidemic state and inflow justify a mid-relaxed approach to preserve mobility during stable epidemic phases. This coordinated strategy reflects epidemiological principles, recognizing that early strong control on largest risk sources yields maximum reduction in imported infections and downstream deaths. Week-by-week allocation balances epidemic control and social-economic needs, preventing sharp mobility disruptions while maintaining effective disease containment. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter or longer control durations would be needed, especially for high-inflow states like Texas. Conversely, if local Mississippi transmission decreases or vaccination coverage improves, relaxation could be accelerated. This dynamic approach ensures flexible, data-driven epidemic-mobility trade-offs across origin states, optimizing public health outcomes while sustaining essential travel and commerce."

Arizona, Mississippi, and Texas have significant infected populations and/or large inbound flows, justifying strict control initially to reduce early seeding of infections in New Mexico, which currently has moderate active infections. This phased strict-first approach allows New Mexico to protect its population during early weeks when imported infections could exacerbate the local epidemic. Virginia's lower inbound flow and moderate prevalence justify a more relaxed mid-level control, balancing mobility and epidemic risk. Across states, the strategies cooperate by front-loading strict controls where infection import risks are highest, progressively relaxing as local conditions hopefully improve. Sensitivity to prevalence or transmission rates (beta) means if infections rise or beta increases, stricter early controls would be even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence drops or beta falls, controls could be relaxed sooner. This coordinated approach optimizes epidemic control while preserving essential mobility for economic and social functions."

States with high infection prevalence and moderate to high inbound flows (Mississippi, Arizona) are assigned stricter early control patterns ('S1_strict_first_then_relaxed'), reducing the initial seeding pressure when Texas's own epidemic burden is significant. New Mexico, with very low infection prevalence but large mobility importance, receives a more relaxed control ('S5_mid_relaxed') to sustain economic and social activity without substantially increasing imported risk. Virginia's moderate infection prevalence and flow warrant a balanced 'S4_mid_strict' strategy to maintain consistent control and avoid fluctuations in imported risk. Coordinated timing of controls across states reduces overlapping infection influx peaks, easing Texas's epidemic management. Sensitivity to infection prevalence and transmission rate (beta) is critical: higher prevalence or beta would justify stricter controls, while lower values could allow relaxed strategies. This policy mix reflects a data-driven, adaptive approach to managing epidemic risk through targeted traffic control, balancing public health protection and mobility needs."

Arizona, Mississippi, and Texas, due to their combination of moderate-to-high infected prevalence and substantial daily inflows, are managed with the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy, imposing strong early restrictions to sharply reduce infection importation during the most critical initial weeks. This aligns with the epidemiological principle of early containment, reducing cumulative exposed and infected cases in Virginia. New Mexico, with its low infection prevalence and smaller inflow, is assigned a more relaxed 'S5_mid_relaxed' strategy to maintain essential mobility and economic activity without significant epidemic risk. Importantly, the cumulative fractions in each strategy sum to 1, ensuring total inbound flow preservation while modulating weekly distributions to optimize epidemic control. This coordinated approach across states leverages temporal control intensity variations to manage risk dynamically, reducing initial seeding while enabling phased mobility recovery. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) increases in any origin state, stricter early controls would become more imperative; conversely, if prevalence decreases, relaxation could be accelerated. The multi-state coordinated strategy thus balances epidemic risk reduction with essential mobility preservation, minimizing expected imported infections and deaths in Virginia during the next 4 weeks."

High-risk states with sizable infected populations and large inbound flows¡ªTexas and Mississippi¡ªreceive the strictest initial controls via the 'strict first then relaxed' strategy, reducing early epidemic seeding in Arizona. New Mexico, despite low prevalence but very high flow, is managed through a mid-level consistent control to balance risk and mobility. Virginia's moderate prevalence and low travel volume warrant a uniform control approach to maintain steady mobility while mitigating risk. This differentiated approach efficiently allocates control efforts proportional to epidemiological risk and mobility volume, optimizing the epidemic-mobility trade-off. The phased strategies allow gradual relaxation to support economic and social necessities without compromising epidemic control. Sensitivity to prevalence and transmission rate beta is critical; higher beta or prevalence would justify stricter controls, while lower values allow more relaxed strategies. The combined weekly allocations ensure that cumulative imported infections are minimized by frontloading strict controls in high-risk states and maintaining balanced restrictions elsewhere, achieving a coordinated multi-state epidemic mitigation while preserving essential mobility flows into Arizona."

The strict-first-then-relaxed approach reduces initial importation risk when Mississippi's susceptible population remains substantial. For states with moderate infection levels and lower flows, like New Mexico and Virginia, mid-level or mid-relaxed controls balance epidemic control with essential mobility and economic activity. The strategy leverages temporal variation in restrictions to align with epidemic dynamics and local capacity. Sensitivity to parameters like beta (transmission rate) and prevalence underscores that earlier strict control substantially reduces downstream cases and deaths by preventing seeding events. If beta or prevalence were to increase, stricter or longer controls would be warranted. Conversely, lower values could justify more relaxed policies. Overall, this coordinated multi-state approach optimizes public health outcomes while preserving critical mobility essential for Mississippi's economy and social fabric."

Arizona and Mississippi present high infection prevalence or exposed cases; thus, S1 strict-first-then-relaxed strategies reduce early importation risk. Texas, with the highest flow and moderate infection levels, is controlled via a mid-strict uniform strategy (S4) to maintain essential mobility while managing risk. Virginia's moderate risk and low flow justify an S1 pattern as well. Collectively, these strategies reduce cumulative imported infections by frontloading restrictions when local susceptibility is high and imported risk is greatest. This staged approach aligns with epidemiological principles of reducing early seeding events that can amplify secondary transmission. Sensitivity to parameter changes like beta or prevalence suggests that increases in infection rates or variant transmissibility would warrant stricter or prolonged controls, especially on high-flow origins. Conversely, improvements in source states' epidemic control would support gradual relaxation. The coordinated multi-state approach balances epidemic control and economic mobility preservation effectively."

This front-loaded control reduces the seeding risk and subsequent local transmission. For New Mexico, which has a lower infection prevalence but high mobility volume, a mid-relaxed strategy balances the necessity of maintaining essential flows with controlling risk. The coordinated approach across states leverages differences in epidemic severity and flow volumes to allocate control resources efficiently, reducing cumulative imported infections and deaths. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) were higher than current estimates, stricter or more prolonged controls would be necessary, while lower prevalence would allow more relaxed policies. The chosen strategies also consider social and economic impacts, aiming to avoid prolonged lockdowns that can cause mobility and economic harm, while still prioritizing epidemic control.

High-prevalence states with large inbound flows (Arizona, Mississippi, Texas) adopt the 'strict first then relaxed' (S1) strategy, which imposes stronger control initially to reduce early importation risk, then eases restrictions as the local epidemic improves. This phased approach balances epidemic control with essential mobility. New Mexico, with its lower infection prevalence and smaller flow, uses the 'mid strict' (S4) strategy to maintain moderate uniform control, preventing complacency and sudden import spikes while preserving travel. Collectively, this distribution strategically reduces cumulative infected imports by weighting restrictions proportional to infection import risk (Flow * I/pop), thereby lowering Virginia¡¯s epidemic burden. Weekly fractions allow adaptive control intensity reflecting changing epidemic conditions and mobility needs. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter or earlier controls may be necessary, especially from high-risk states. Conversely, if prevalence declines, controls can be relaxed sooner.

High-infection, high-inflow states like Texas and Mississippi receive the strict-first-then-relaxed strategy (S1) to sharply reduce early importation when risk peaks, thereby lowering initial seeding that could amplify local outbreaks. New Mexico, with low infection prevalence but very high inflow, is assigned a mid-strict strategy (S4) to balance risk and economic necessity. Virginia, with moderate infection and inflow, employs a uniform strategy (S3) to maintain consistent control without sharp disruptions. This diversified approach leverages the trade-off between epidemiological risk and mobility preservation across states and weeks. Quantitatively, imported infected individuals approximate inflow * ft * (I/pop), so concentrating stricter controls early in states with higher infection ratios and flows reduces early imported cases, thereby lowering subsequent transmission chains. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta rises, stricter or earlier controls become more critical, especially for high-flow origins. Conversely, if prevalence declines, relaxed or uniform strategies optimize mobility with minimal epidemiological risk. Coordination across weeks and states ensures that Arizona's inbound traffic is managed dynamically to reduce cumulative risk while sustaining essential mobility, preserving public health and economic stability."

States with high infection prevalence and large inbound flows, such as Texas and Arizona, are assigned the 'strict first then relaxed' strategy to impose strong initial restrictions, reducing early importation risks when local susceptibility is high. New Mexico, with low prevalence and low mobility, receives moderate consistent controls (mid strict) to balance epidemic control with mobility. Virginia's moderate prevalence but lower mobility justifies a slightly more relaxed strategy to maintain essential movement while managing risks. This multi-state differentiated approach leverages quantitative infection-import logic: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/pop), where ft is weekly control fraction. By front-loading stricter controls for high-risk states, the policy reduces cumulative imported cases and deaths in Mississippi during critical initial weeks, then relaxes controls to preserve mobility and economic activity. Sensitivity to changes in prevalence or transmission rates is addressed by the staged relaxation, allowing adaptive tightening if risks increase. Overall, this coordination across weeks and states optimizes the epidemic-mobility trade-off, prioritizing public health while sustaining essential inbound flows."

This early strict control reduces the number of infected individuals entering New Mexico during critical epidemic phases, thus minimizing secondary transmissions and cumulative deaths. Mississippi, despite its smaller flow, has high infection prevalence, warranting a mid-strict approach to mitigate risk without fully cutting off mobility. Virginia¡¯s moderate prevalence and low flow justify a more relaxed mid-term approach, preserving essential travel and economic connectivity. The quantitative logic balances imported infected estimates computed as flow * ft * (I/population), ensuring that states with high infection rates and flow receive stricter controls. The phased strategies across weeks allow adaptive risk management, reducing epidemic seeding early and progressively relaxing as risk decreases or immunity grows. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) increases, stricter controls early on become even more critical, especially from high-flow origin states. Conversely, if prevalence drops or effective reproduction numbers fall, mobility can be relaxed sooner without major risk. These coordinated strategies minimize New Mexico¡¯s epidemic burden while maintaining essential cross-state mobility and economic activity.'

States with higher infection prevalence and significant inflow to Texas (Mississippi, Arizona) adopt the strict-first-then-relaxed 'S1' strategy to reduce initial seeding risk while gradually restoring mobility. Lower prevalence origins with large inflows (New Mexico) adopt a more relaxed 'S5' strategy, balancing epidemic control with economic needs. Virginia, with moderate risk and inflow, uses a mid-strict 'S4' approach to contain risk while maintaining mobility. Across the 4-week horizon, these patterns manage cumulative imported infection risk by frontloading restrictions where risk is highest and allowing phased relaxation, thus preventing overwhelming transmission spikes in Texas. Sensitivity to transmission parameters (beta) and prevalence underscores the need for adaptive control; increased prevalence or transmission would necessitate stricter early controls. Conversely, lower prevalence or transmission might allow more uniform or relaxed strategies. This cooperative policy mix leverages temporal and spatial heterogeneity in states¡¯ epidemic dynamics and mobility to optimize health outcomes and preserve essential mobility for Texas."

These states pose the greatest risk of importing infections due to either large infected populations or substantial traffic volume. The S1_strict_first_then_relaxed strategy is effective in these cases to minimize early seeding of new cases and deaths in Virginia by sharply reducing inbound infected cases initially, then gradually relaxing controls to resume essential mobility. For New Mexico, with lower infection prevalence and smaller traffic volumes, a more relaxed mid-level strategy (S5_mid_relaxed) balances epidemic control and mobility preservation. This cross-state approach reduces cumulative imported infections by focusing controls where risk is greatest, while allowing controlled mobility from lower-risk origins. Sensitivity to infection prevalence and transmission rates (beta) supports this dynamic strategy: if prevalence rises or beta increases, stricter early controls become even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence declines, the strategy allows faster relaxation to support economic and social activity. By coordinating control levels and timing across origin states, Virginia can effectively reduce epidemic spread while maintaining essential inbound mobility, optimizing public health and economic outcomes concurrently.'
