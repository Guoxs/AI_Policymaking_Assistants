The infected ratio (I/pop) is approximately 1.7e-4, and exposed ratio is higher, indicating a significant potential for importation of infections through mobility. Given the substantial baseline inflow into New Mexico (25,478 daily), the importation risk is non-trivial. The chosen S1 strategy enforces stricter control in the first week (12% of total allowed mobility), relaxing progressively later, aligning with the need to immediately reduce imported infections to New Mexico during the early weeks when the epidemic risk is highest. This approach balances the epidemiological risk and economic necessity by allowing increased mobility after initial containment. The progressive relaxation accounts for the assumption that New Mexico's own control and vaccination may improve epidemic conditions over time, reducing the relative risk of imported cases."

Thus, strict early control is critical to minimize the importation risk at the start of the 4-week period.
