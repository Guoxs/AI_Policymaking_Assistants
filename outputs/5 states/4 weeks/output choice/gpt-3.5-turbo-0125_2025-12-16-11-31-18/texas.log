Arizona's infection prevalence ratio (I/pop) ~0.000132 is significant given the inflow volume. Implementing the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy reduces traffic initially, limiting early importation of cases when Texas' own cases (I=327, Q=7619) remain moderate but still vulnerable to external seeding. The gradual relaxation aligns with expected improvements in Texas' epidemic curve and balances mobility needs as risk declines.

Choosing the 'S4_mid_strict' strategy applies moderately strict controls uniformly but maintains some flow to preserve essential mobility.

Arizona and Virginia, having moderate infection levels but significant inflow, employ initially strict controls to reduce early importation risk, gradually relaxing as local epidemic conditions improve.

Coordination across weeks and states ensures that control intensity and timing are optimized collectively to prevent overwhelming Texas's healthcare capacity. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates rise in any origin state, stricter controls or earlier implementation would be warranted to prevent imported case surges. Conversely, reductions in prevalence or improved epidemic control in origin states could allow more relaxed policies. This framework dynamically balances epidemic control with economic and social mobility imperatives, ensuring Texas's epidemic trajectory is favorably managed while minimizing unnecessary travel disruptions."

The relatively large susceptible population (8.8 million) and moderate exposed counts (22,919) suggest caution is warranted to prevent importation of infection into Texas. The average daily inbound flow from Arizona is considerable (48,046), which could significantly contribute to imported cases if not controlled. Using the S1 strategy (strict first then relaxed) aligns with the need to initially minimize imported infections during the early weeks when Texas' own infection levels remain high (I=19,508). This strategy reduces initial risk by applying stricter control early, lowering imported infections approximately proportional to flow * ft * (I/pop). As weeks progress and surveillance or immunity potentially improves, relaxing controls permits necessary mobility for economic and social reasons. This balances epidemic control and mobility, mitigating early importation risk while preserving essential inflows later."

The average daily inbound flow from Mississippi to Texas (60,330) is substantial and could lead to significant infected importation if unrestricted. Applying the S1 strategy ensures stringent control during the first weeks, effectively reducing imported infections when Texas' epidemic burden is still significant. This is critical to limit amplification of local cases. Later relaxation supports economic and social needs, reflecting a pragmatic epidemic-mobility trade-off.

Later relaxation phases balance epidemic control with the preservation of essential economic and social mobility, preventing prolonged economic disruption. The high inbound flow from New Mexico, coupled with its low infection prevalence, justifies a more relaxed strategy allowing more consistent mobility with moderate control.

Given this moderate infection risk and mobility, the S4_mid_strict strategy, which applies stricter control at the start and end of the 4-week period with relatively relaxed middle weeks, is appropriate.

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic control policies across origin states are designed collectively to minimize imported infections and deaths in Texas while sustaining essential mobility. States with high infection prevalence, such as Mississippi, receive the strictest early controls (S1) to sharply reduce imported cases when Texas's local infections remain high. Moderate risk states like Arizona also follow S1 to balance early epidemic containment with gradual relaxation. Low-prevalence, high-flow states like New Mexico adopt a mid-relaxed approach (S5), leveraging their low risk to maintain mobility without significantly raising Texas¡¯s epidemic burden. Virginia¡¯s moderate risk and flow justify a mid-strict strategy (S4) with focused controls during vulnerable Texas epidemic phases. Quantitatively, the imported infected estimate (Flow * ft * (I/pop)) guides the control intensity, prioritizing states contributing the largest infection import risk. Week-by-week allocation strategies balance early suppression of imported infections with later mobility restoration, critical for economic and social stability. Sensitivity to parameters such as infection prevalence and transmission rate (beta) is high; increasing prevalence or beta would warrant more stringent early controls, while reductions may allow relaxation.

States with high infection prevalence, such as Mississippi, receive the strictest early controls (S1) to sharply reduce imported cases when Texas's local infections remain high. Moderate risk states like Arizona also follow S1 to balance early epidemic containment with gradual relaxation. Low-prevalence, high-flow states like New Mexico adopt a mid-relaxed approach (S5), leveraging their low risk to maintain mobility without significantly raising Texas¡¯s epidemic burden. Virginia¡¯s moderate risk and flow justify a mid-strict strategy (S4) with focused controls during vulnerable Texas epidemic phases. Quantitatively, the imported infected estimate (Flow * ft * (I/pop)) guides the control intensity, prioritizing states contributing the largest infection import risk. Week-by-week allocation strategies balance early suppression of imported infections with later mobility restoration, critical for economic and social stability. Sensitivity to parameters such as infection prevalence and transmission rate (beta) is high; increasing prevalence or beta would warrant more stringent early controls, while reductions may allow relaxation. This coordinated, data-driven approach optimizes epidemic control and mobility preservation in Texas during the next 4 weeks."

Lower prevalence origins with large inflows (New Mexico) adopt a more relaxed 'S5' strategy, balancing epidemic control with economic needs. Virginia, with moderate risk and inflow, uses a mid-strict 'S4' approach to contain risk while maintaining mobility. Across the 4-week horizon, these patterns manage cumulative imported infection risk by frontloading restrictions where risk is highest and allowing phased relaxation, thus preventing overwhelming transmission spikes in Texas. Sensitivity to transmission parameters (beta) and prevalence underscores the need for adaptive control; increased prevalence or transmission would necessitate stricter early controls.

States with higher infection prevalence and significant inflow to Texas (Mississippi, Arizona) adopt the strict-first-then-relaxed 'S1' strategy to reduce initial seeding risk while gradually restoring mobility. Lower prevalence origins with large inflows (New Mexico) adopt a more relaxed 'S5' strategy, balancing epidemic control with economic needs. Virginia, with moderate risk and inflow, uses a mid-strict 'S4' approach to contain risk while maintaining mobility. Across the 4-week horizon, these patterns manage cumulative imported infection risk by frontloading restrictions where risk is highest and allowing phased relaxation, thus preventing overwhelming transmission spikes in Texas. Sensitivity to transmission parameters (beta) and prevalence underscores the need for adaptive control; increased prevalence or transmission would necessitate stricter early controls. Conversely, lower prevalence or transmission might allow more uniform or relaxed strategies. This cooperative policy mix leverages temporal and spatial heterogeneity in states¡¯ epidemic dynamics and mobility to optimize health outcomes and preserve essential mobility for Texas."
