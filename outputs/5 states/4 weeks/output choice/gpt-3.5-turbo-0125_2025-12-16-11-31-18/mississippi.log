Arizona¡¯s inbound flow to Mississippi is moderate (avg 1471.52 daily), which combined with its relative infection prevalence suggests a moderate risk of importing infections. The chosen strategy, 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed', imposes stricter control initially to curb early importation risk, then gradually relaxes to preserve mobility as Mississippi's local control improves. This phased approach balances the initial need to reduce importation of exposed and infected individuals while maintaining essential traffic over time.

This reduces initial imported infections into Mississippi when its own epidemic burden is high (I=9038, E=18986), limiting new seeding events and allowing healthcare resources to stabilize. Virginia, with higher prevalence but moderate flow, receives a more balanced mid-strict control (S4) to maintain steady risk mitigation without overly restricting mobility. This coordinated approach minimizes cumulative imported infections by front-loading restrictions where needed and gradually relaxing them as local conditions improve, preserving essential economic and social activity. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) increase, stricter early controls become even more critical, especially for high-flow states.

This coordinated approach minimizes cumulative imported infections and deaths by suppressing early importation risk when Mississippi's susceptible population is large and vulnerable. Gradually relaxing controls in later weeks supports economic and social mobility recovery, preventing prolonged disruption. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or beta increase, early strict controls become even more critical to avoid overwhelming local healthcare. Conversely, if prevalence declines or beta decreases, the phased relaxation preserves mobility without compromising epidemic control. The uniform strategy simplifies implementation and ensures equitable risk management across diverse origins with varying epidemic dynamics and mobility volumes.

Early strict controls (lower ft values in week 1 and 2) across all origins reduce the initial seeding of infections into Mississippi, which currently has a significant exposed and infected population. This coordinated approach minimizes cumulative imported infections and deaths by suppressing early importation risk when Mississippi's susceptible population is large and vulnerable. Gradually relaxing controls in later weeks supports economic and social mobility recovery, preventing prolonged disruption. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or beta increase, early strict controls become even more critical to avoid overwhelming local healthcare. Conversely, if prevalence declines or beta decreases, the phased relaxation preserves mobility without compromising epidemic control. The uniform strategy simplifies implementation and ensures equitable risk management across diverse origins with varying epidemic dynamics and mobility volumes.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control strategies across origin states collectively aim to minimize imported infections and deaths into Mississippi by tailoring controls to each state's epidemic risk and mobility volume. States with high infection prevalence and large inbound flows, such as Texas and Arizona, are assigned the 'strict first then relaxed' strategy to impose strong initial restrictions, reducing early importation risks when local susceptibility is high. New Mexico, with low prevalence and low mobility, receives moderate consistent controls (mid strict) to balance epidemic control with mobility. Virginia's moderate prevalence but lower mobility justifies a slightly more relaxed strategy to maintain essential movement while managing risks. This multi-state differentiated approach leverages quantitative infection-import logic: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/pop), where ft is weekly control fraction. By front-loading stricter controls for high-risk states, the policy reduces cumulative imported cases and deaths in Mississippi during critical initial weeks, then relaxes controls to preserve mobility and economic activity. Sensitivity to changes in prevalence or transmission rates is addressed by the staged relaxation, allowing adaptive tightening if risks increase. Overall, this coordination across weeks and states optimizes the epidemic-mobility trade-off, prioritizing public health while sustaining essential inbound flows."
