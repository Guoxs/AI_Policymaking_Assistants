Given the substantial average daily inbound flow into Mississippi (1471.52), the potential imported infections each week can be approximated by Flow * fraction * (I / Population). Applying a strict control early (low fractions in first weeks) helps reduce initial imported cases when Mississippi still faces exposure risk, allowing gradual relaxation as local control improves.

Despite the low prevalence, Arizona's very high inbound flow to Mississippi (average 2601.43 daily) poses a non-negligible risk of importing infections. The imported infected estimate can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population), indicating that even a small prevalence multiplied by large flows can result in meaningful case imports. Given this, a strategy that starts with strict controls to quickly limit initial importation risk, then gradually relaxes is appropriate. This balances early epidemic suppression with mobility needs as risk diminishes. The chosen 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy reduces initial import risk while allowing increasing traffic later, minimizing disruption to travel and commerce over time. This approach best aligns with Arizona¡¯s moderate infection risk and high mobility influence on Mississippi¡¯s epidemic."

  "global_guidance": "The chosen strategies collectively aim to minimize Mississippi's cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by tailoring inbound traffic controls based on origin states' infection prevalence and flow volumes. Texas, with the highest infected count and inbound flow, receives the strictest early control (S1) to sharply reduce imported infections during the critical early weeks. Arizona, with moderate prevalence and flow, is similarly managed with strict early control but allows somewhat faster relaxation. New Mexico's low prevalence and flow justify a consistent mid-level restriction (S4) to maintain steady risk mitigation without excess mobility disruption. Virginia, despite having relatively high prevalence, has lower flow, allowing a more relaxed mid-level approach (S5) to balance risk and mobility. This allocation strategy leverages quantitative infection-import logic, where imported infected approximates flow * fraction * (I/pop), to prioritize restrictions where the product of prevalence and flow is highest. The phased fraction patterns also account for temporal epidemic dynamics, front-loading restrictions where necessary and relaxing as risk decreases or local controls improve. Sensitivity to beta and other epidemiological parameters suggests that if transmission rates increase, stricter or longer controls would be required, especially for high-flow, high-prevalence states like Texas. Conversely, if prevalence drops or testing and quarantine improve, controls could be more relaxed. This cooperative allocation across states optimizes epidemic control and essential mobility, minimizing imported infections and associated mortality risk to Mississippi."

Texas, with the highest infected count and inbound flow, receives the strictest early control (S1) to sharply reduce imported infections during the critical early weeks. Arizona, with moderate prevalence and flow, is similarly managed with strict early control but allows somewhat faster relaxation. New Mexico's low prevalence and flow justify a consistent mid-level restriction (S4) to maintain steady risk mitigation without excess mobility disruption. Virginia, despite having relatively high prevalence, has lower flow, allowing a more relaxed mid-level approach (S5) to balance risk and mobility. This allocation strategy leverages quantitative infection-import logic, where imported infected approximates flow * fraction * (I/pop), to prioritize restrictions where the product of prevalence and flow is highest. The phased fraction patterns also account for temporal epidemic dynamics, front-loading restrictions where necessary and relaxing as risk decreases or local controls improve. Sensitivity to beta and other epidemiological parameters suggests that if transmission rates increase, stricter or longer controls would be required, especially for high-flow, high-prevalence states like Texas. Conversely, if prevalence drops or testing and quarantine improve, controls could be more relaxed.

Lower-risk states with smaller infected proportions and lower flows (Arizona, New Mexico) are assigned the strict-first-then-relaxed pattern to protect Mississippi early on while progressively restoring mobility. This phased relaxation across states and weeks allows for adaptive risk mitigation, balancing disease control and economic activity. Sensitivity to parameters like infection prevalence and transmission rate (beta) is critical; higher beta or prevalence would necessitate stricter or prolonged controls. Conversely, if prevalence declines, relaxation could be accelerated. This coordinated approach across states optimizes cumulative risk reduction in Mississippi while preserving essential mobility, recognizing the trade-offs inherent in epidemic control and economic functioning."

High-risk states with larger infected proportions and higher inbound flows (Texas, Virginia) receive stricter or mid-strict controls initially, reducing the product of inbound flow, fraction, and infected proportion (Flow * ft * (I/pop)) to lower expected imported infections. Lower-risk states with smaller infected proportions and lower flows (Arizona, New Mexico) are assigned the strict-first-then-relaxed pattern to protect Mississippi early on while progressively restoring mobility. This phased relaxation across states and weeks allows for adaptive risk mitigation, balancing disease control and economic activity. Sensitivity to parameters like infection prevalence and transmission rate (beta) is critical; higher beta or prevalence would necessitate stricter or prolonged controls. Conversely, if prevalence declines, relaxation could be accelerated.
