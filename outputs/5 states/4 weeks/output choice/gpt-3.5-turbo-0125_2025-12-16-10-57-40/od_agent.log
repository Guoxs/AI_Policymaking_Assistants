Mississippi, Texas, and Virginia are assigned the strict-first-then-relaxed strategy to sharply reduce early importation risk due to their moderate to high infection prevalence or high inflow, mitigating immediate pressures on Arizona's healthcare system. New Mexico, with a substantial inflow and moderate infection levels, receives a consistent mid-strict policy to balance risk and mobility over time. This coordinated approach minimizes cumulative imported infections and deaths by targeting early intervention in high-risk states while allowing gradual normalization. Sensitivity to beta or prevalence changes underscores the need for adaptable policies; higher transmissibility or rising infections would justify prolonging strict phases or adopting uniformly stricter controls. Conversely, declining prevalence might permit more relaxed allocations. Collectively, this policy suite leverages temporal dynamics and heterogeneity in origin states to optimize Arizona's epidemic and mobility outcomes over the next month."

Arizona, Texas, and Virginia, each with significant infected populations and/or high mobility flows, are assigned the strict-first-then-relaxed strategy to prioritize rigorous early control and gradual normalization. New Mexico, with a moderate infection prevalence and inbound flow, receives a mid-strict strategy to maintain consistent control without excessive early restrictions. This coordinated approach recognizes the interplay between infection prevalence and inbound flow: states with high flow but low prevalence (Texas) still warrant strict early controls due to absolute numbers of potential imported infections. Conversely, states with moderate prevalence and flow (New Mexico) benefit from steady mid-level controls. The phased relaxation patterns allow Mississippi to preserve essential mobility and economic activity while minimizing epidemic risk during peak vulnerability periods. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection rates or transmission coefficients (beta) increase in any origin state, stricter or prolonged controls would be advised to prevent resurgence. Conversely, if prevalence declines, gradual relaxation can be accelerated with careful monitoring. This multi-state, multi-week strategy integrates epidemiological data and mobility patterns to optimize health outcomes and mobility preservation effectively.'

Arizona and Mississippi have moderate to high infection rates and significant inflows; thus, strict early restrictions reduce initial infection importation risk, allowing New Mexico to stabilize local epidemic dynamics. Texas, with very low prevalence but massive travel volume, benefits from a mid-level steady control (S4) to balance risk and mobility. Virginia¡¯s moderate risk and low inflow justify a similar strict-then-relaxed approach to prevent importation surges. This coordinated strategy lowers cumulative imported infections by temporally modulating restrictions, preventing simultaneous import peaks from multiple states. Sensitivity analysis shows that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, earlier and stricter controls become more critical, especially for high-flow states. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, gradual relaxation accelerates, preserving economic activity. This approach balances epidemic suppression with essential mobility, optimizing public health outcomes while sustaining critical travel and commerce.'

Arizona and New Mexico pose high importation risk due to a combination of moderate-to-high infected prevalence and large inbound flows; thus, they receive strict early restrictions gradually easing over time to reduce initial infection seeding. Mississippi, with moderate prevalence and flow, receives a mid-strict approach balancing control and mobility. Virginia, despite higher prevalence, has lower flow, allowing a more relaxed mid-level strategy. This coordinated approach reduces the cumulative number of infected arrivals by suppressing flows when infection prevalence is high and relaxing controls as risk diminishes or Texas¡¯s internal epidemic evolves. Sensitivity considerations include potential changes in beta or prevalence; increased transmission rates or prevalence would necessitate even stricter early controls, while decreases might allow more relaxed patterns. Coordination across weeks and states ensures that the imported infection burden is flattened, preventing overwhelming local health systems while maintaining essential mobility for economic and social functions.'

States with moderate to high infection prevalence and significant inflow (Arizona, Mississippi, New Mexico, Texas) require phased or moderate traffic restrictions to reduce imported infections while preserving essential movement. The strict-first-then-relaxed strategy is chosen for Arizona and Texas, which have large inflows but lower or moderate infection prevalence, allowing early stringent controls that relax as local conditions improve. Mississippi's higher prevalence justifies a mid-strict uniform approach to balance sustained epidemic control and mobility. New Mexico's moderate prevalence but lower inflow supports a mid-relaxed pattern, permitting more mobility with manageable risk. This cooperative strategy reduces expected imported infections and deaths across weeks by front-loading restrictions where needed and gradually relaxing them, preventing epidemic resurgence. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter or longer-lasting controls may become necessary to prevent import-driven outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence drops, mobility could be further relaxed earlier. This approach balances epidemiological prudence with economic and social necessities, leveraging flow fractions to dynamically tune importation risk and preserve essential interstate connectivity."

For states with higher infection prevalence and/or large inbound flows (Texas and Mississippi), stricter early restrictions (S1_strict_first_then_relaxed) minimize initial imported infections, crucial for preventing epidemic surges in Arizona. For New Mexico, with lower prevalence but high flow, a mid-relaxed pattern (S5_mid_relaxed) maintains mobility while mitigating moderate risk. Virginia, with moderate prevalence and low flow, is managed with mid-strict control (S4_mid_strict) to balance risk and mobility. This cross-state approach leverages temporal variation in control intensity, concentrating restrictions when imported risk is highest and relaxing as risk diminishes or immunity builds. The multiplicative infection-import logic (Flow * ft * I/pop) guides this allocation, focusing restrictions where they yield greatest epidemic control impact. Sensitivity to parameter changes (e.g., infection rate beta or prevalence fluctuations) suggests that if prevalence rises in any origin, stricter early control would be warranted, while lower prevalence or reduced flow could justify relaxation. This coordinated multi-state strategy reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths in Arizona by tailoring control intensity to origin-specific risk and flow, thus optimizing the epidemic-mobility trade-off."

High inflow states with moderate infection prevalence, such as Texas and Arizona, receive stricter initial controls ('S1_strict_first_then_relaxed'), reducing early importation risk during critical epidemic phases. States with lower infection prevalence and moderate inflow, like New Mexico, are assigned mid-strict controls ('S4_mid_strict') to balance safety and mobility. Virginia, with moderate infection prevalence and inflow, is managed by a mid-relaxed strategy ('S5_mid_relaxed'), reflecting a balanced approach. Collectively, these strategies reduce cumulative imported infections by lowering the product of flow, fraction, and infection prevalence over four weeks. The phased nature of most chosen strategies allows gradual easing, supporting economic recovery without compromising epidemic control. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter controls in early weeks become even more critical to prevent exponential growth. Conversely, if prevalence falls, controls can be relaxed sooner to preserve mobility. This coordinated multi-state approach optimally manages the epidemic-mobility trade-off for Mississippi, minimizing imported cases and fatalities while preserving essential travel and commerce."

States with higher infection prevalence and/or large flows, such as Mississippi and Arizona, receive the strictest early restrictions ('S1_strict_first_then_relaxed') to suppress initial imported infections, leveraging the initial low ft values to reduce early seeding. Texas, with very high flow but moderate prevalence, receives a mid-strict control ('S4_mid_strict') to balance epidemic risk and mobility, imposing stricter control during critical middle weeks while allowing some flow initially and later. Virginia, with moderate prevalence and low flow, is managed with uniform moderate control ('S3_uniform'), ensuring steady risk mitigation without excessive disruption. This cooperative traffic allocation leverages temporal changes in restrictions to balance epidemic control and economic needs, recognizing that infection import risk depends on both prevalence and flow. Sensitivity analyses affirm that if infection prevalence rises or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls are more critical to prevent rapid epidemic growth. Conversely, if prevalence falls or local controls improve, gradual relaxation can be expedited. Coordinated staggered controls across states reduce cumulative imported infections and deaths more effectively than uniform or no control strategies. This approach carefully weighs epidemic risks and essential mobility to protect New Mexico's public health while sustaining essential travel and commerce."

Arizona and Mississippi, both with elevated infection counts and sizable inflows, receive the 'strict-first-then-relaxed' pattern to sharply reduce importation risk at the epidemic onset, protecting Texas when it is most vulnerable. New Mexico, despite the highest inflow, has lower prevalence, justifying a 'mid-strict' approach that balances moderate control and essential mobility. Virginia's lower inflow and moderate infection levels support a more relaxed strategy, preserving mobility with limited risk. This multi-state differentiated approach leverages epidemiological data (I/pop) and mobility to tailor controls week-by-week, effectively reducing the expected number of imported infections calculated as inflow * fraction * (I/pop). The cooperation across weeks ensures initial suppression of high-risk importation sources, followed by gradual normalization to support economic and social activities. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if transmission rates (beta) increase or prevalence estimates shift, early strict controls become even more critical, particularly for states with high mobility. Conversely, if infection prevalence declines faster than expected, controls can be further relaxed to maximize mobility benefits. This strategy provides a flexible, data-driven framework to dynamically balance epidemic control and essential mobility for Texas."

For New Mexico, with lower infection prevalence and moderate flow, a more balanced 'S5_mid_relaxed' strategy optimizes mobility while maintaining epidemic control. Collectively, these allocations reduce the cumulative imported infections by weighting restrictions proportional to infection prevalence and inbound flow. This cross-state cooperation logic ensures that Virginia's epidemic risk is minimized without unnecessarily crippling mobility from lower-risk states.

Quantitatively, imported infections roughly scale with Flow * fraction * (I/pop). Applying the strict-first-then-relaxed strategy to high-risk states frontloads restrictions when imported infection risk is highest, reducing cumulative cases and deaths in Arizona. Moderate or mid-strict strategies for lower-risk states maintain essential mobility to support economic and social functions, recognizing their lower infection prevalence. The cooperative logic leverages the temporal dimension to relax controls as risks abate or local management improves, balancing epidemic suppression and mobility needs. Sensitivity to parameter changes (e.g., beta or infection prevalence) suggests that if infection rates increase in any origin state, stricter controls might be warranted; conversely, if prevalence declines, relaxation could be accelerated. This dynamic approach ensures that Arizona¡¯s inbound traffic policies are adaptive, targeted, and effective in minimizing disease spread while preserving vital movement.'

States with lower infection prevalence and flow, such as New Mexico and Arizona, are controlled strictly in early weeks to prevent seeding but allowed gradual relaxation, mitigating economic and social impact. Texas, with the highest flow and moderate infection prevalence, is assigned a mid-strict uniform control to consistently reduce importation without severe disruption. Virginia, with intermediate prevalence and flow, follows a strict-first-then-relaxed approach for early containment. This coordinated approach leverages the temporal dynamics of epidemic spread, focusing on reducing importation when it matters most (early weeks) and allowing relaxation later to balance epidemic and mobility needs. Sensitivity to changes in prevalence or transmission rates (beta) suggests that if prevalence rises, stricter initial controls would be warranted, especially from high-flow states like Texas. Conversely, if beta decreases due to vaccination or behavior change, some relaxation could be safely accelerated. The chosen strategies reflect a dynamic, risk-based, and cooperative control policy, aiming to reduce cumulative cases and deaths in Mississippi by minimizing infectious importation from all key origin states over the next 4 weeks.'

States with high infection prevalence and/or large inbound flows, such as Mississippi and Arizona, are assigned strict-first-then-relaxed strategies to sharply reduce imported infections early, preventing seeding of outbreaks in New Mexico. Texas, with the highest inbound flow but moderate infection levels, receives a mid-strict strategy, balancing epidemic control with economic and social needs. Virginia, with low flows and moderate infection prevalence, is managed with a uniform moderate control, reflecting its lower risk. This coordinated approach reduces New Mexico's cumulative imported infections and deaths by focusing restrictions where epidemiological risks are highest and allowing gradual relaxation to restore mobility. The strategy leverages temporal variation and cross-state differences to optimize outcomes. Sensitivity to parameters like transmission rate beta and prevalence is considered; higher beta or prevalence would warrant stricter controls, while improvements in local epidemic conditions could relax restrictions. Overall, these policies collectively minimize New Mexico's epidemic burden while preserving critical mobility."

States with higher infection prevalence and significant inbound flow, such as Mississippi and Arizona, have been assigned the S1_strict_first_then_relaxed strategy to impose strong early restrictions that reduce initial seeding of infections into Texas, followed by gradual relaxation to sustain mobility. New Mexico, with low infection prevalence despite large inbound flow, is assigned a more relaxed S5_mid_relaxed strategy to preserve essential movement while maintaining moderate control. Virginia, with moderate infection levels and flow, is also assigned the S1 strategy to balance risk and mobility. This cooperative allocation across states reduces cumulative imported infectious cases by front-loading restrictions on high-risk origins while allowing flexibility for lower-risk states. The weekly fraction allocation ensures that Texas can adapt to evolving epidemic dynamics by progressively relaxing controls, reducing socioeconomic disruption. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) increases in an origin state, stronger or prolonged restrictions would be necessary to prevent surges in Texas. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, the model allows for earlier relaxation to optimize mobility. This adaptive, risk-based approach is essential to balance epidemic control with maintaining critical economic and social activities in Texas."

States with higher infection prevalence and/or higher inbound flows (Mississippi and Texas) are assigned the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy to sharply reduce importation risk early on, allowing for graduated relaxation as conditions permit. Arizona, with moderate prevalence and high flow, also follows this approach to manage its substantial importation risk cautiously. New Mexico, with low infection prevalence and lower flow, is assigned a mid-relaxed strategy ('S5_mid_relaxed') to maintain essential mobility without undue restrictions. This differentiated policy mix leverages temporal control adjustments to reduce overall imported infections and deaths while preserving critical socioeconomic functions. The cooperation across weeks and states reflects a balance between immediate epidemic risk reduction and long-term mobility sustainability. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) increases, stricter strategies or longer durations of control would be necessary to maintain protection. Conversely, if these parameters decrease, more relaxed policies could be safely adopted earlier, highlighting the importance of dynamic policy adaptation based on real-time epidemic data."

States with higher infection prevalence and/or large inbound flows (Mississippi and Texas) are assigned the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy to impose early strong restrictions that reduce initial infection importation risk, thereby curbing the epidemic's seeding potential in Arizona. New Mexico, with low infection prevalence but very high flow, receives a 'S4_mid_strict' moderate control approach to balance risk and mobility. Virginia, with moderate prevalence and low flow, uses a uniform strategy to maintain steady control. This coordinated approach leverages temporal variation in controls to reduce imported infections when risk is highest and relaxes them as local epidemic control improves. Quantitatively, expected imported infected cases per week are proportional to flow * fraction * (I/pop), so front-loading strict controls on higher-risk states curtails cumulative imported infections effectively. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter or longer duration controls would be beneficial, whereas lower risk would allow more relaxed policies. This strategy suite thus provides a flexible, data-driven framework to manage epidemic risk while sustaining critical mobility between states."

States with higher infection prevalence and/or larger inflows, such as Texas and Arizona, are assigned strategies with stricter initial controls (S1_strict_first_then_relaxed) to sharply reduce imported transmission risk at the epidemic's early critical phase. States with lower prevalence but moderate flows, like New Mexico, receive mid-strict policies (S4_mid_strict) to maintain cautious control without excessive mobility disruption. Virginia's intermediate risk warrants a uniform moderate control (S3_uniform) to provide stable and consistent mitigation. This coordinated approach exploits temporal and spatial heterogeneity: early strictness reduces immediate importation risks when Mississippi is vulnerable, while gradual relaxation preserves essential mobility and economic activity. The quantitative infection-import logic (imported_infections ~ Flow * fraction * (I/population)) underscores how large flows from even low-prevalence states can fuel outbreaks, justifying differentiated controls. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter controls or extended durations would be necessary, especially for high-flow origins. Conversely, if prevalence declines or vaccination improves, more relaxed strategies can be adopted safely. Overall, this policy ensemble balances epidemic suppression and mobility preservation, minimizing cumulative case and death burden in Mississippi over the coming month."

States with higher infection prevalence and/or larger inbound flows (Arizona, Mississippi, Texas) receive the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy, imposing stronger early travel restrictions to reduce initial seeding risk in New Mexico. This phased relaxation reflects anticipated improvements in both external and internal epidemic control. Mississippi, despite low volume, has high prevalence, justifying strict early control to prevent substantial imported infections. Virginia, with moderate prevalence but low flow, is assigned a uniform strategy to balance mobility and epidemic control without excessive restrictions. The cooperation logic leverages the multiplicative reduction of imported infections by flow fraction and infected prevalence, reducing cumulative imported cases more effectively than uniform or no controls. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter or prolonged controls may be needed, especially for high-flow states. Conversely, if local New Mexico conditions improve or vaccination coverage increases, relaxation can be accelerated.

This approach reduces the initial seeding risk when Texas' susceptible population is large and the epidemic is active. For New Mexico, with low infection prevalence but high inflow, a mid-relaxed strategy balances control and essential mobility, avoiding unnecessary economic disruption. By staggering restrictions over the 4 weeks (strictest control in the first weeks followed by relaxation), Texas manages the trade-off between epidemiological safety and mobility preservation. Importation risk is quantitatively approximated as Flow * ft * (I/pop), so states with higher I/pop or inflow receive stricter early control (lower ft). The cooperation logic across states ensures cumulative imported infections are minimized without fully shutting down mobility, supporting sustainable epidemic management. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter and longer controls would be necessary to prevent surges. Conversely, decreases in prevalence or improved local control in Texas could allow faster relaxation. This adaptive, state-specific policy framework maximizes epidemic control while maintaining critical mobility flows into Texas."

High-prevalence states with significant inbound flow such as Mississippi and Texas are assigned the S1_strict_first_then_relaxed pattern, imposing stronger early restrictions to reduce initial seeding risk while allowing gradual reopening. Arizona, with moderate prevalence and large flow, also adopts S1 to balance risk and mobility. Low-prevalence New Mexico receives a more relaxed strategy (S5_mid_relaxed), preserving essential mobility with moderate caution. This coordinated approach reduces the cumulative expected imported infections by lowering flow fractions during early weeks when outbreaks are most sensitive to imported cases, thereby flattening potential secondary waves in Virginia. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, the benefit of early strict controls amplifies, reinforcing the chosen initial strict strategies for higher-risk states. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, the mid-relaxed or uniform strategies become more favorable. This allocation reflects epidemiological prudence and socio-economic balance, ensuring Virginia¡¯s epidemic is controlled without excessive disruption to essential travel and commerce."

States with higher infection prevalence and/or larger daily inflows (Texas and Mississippi) are assigned the strict-first-then-relaxed pattern (S1) to strongly curb early imported infections, protecting Arizona's epidemic containment efforts during vulnerable periods. New Mexico, with low prevalence but high inflow, receives a mid-strict pattern (S4) balancing control and mobility. Virginia, with moderate prevalence and low inflow, is managed with a mid-relaxed pattern (S5) to maintain essential mobility while applying moderate epidemic control. This coordinated approach distributes restrictions dynamically over four weeks to reduce cumulative imported cases and deaths effectively. Sensitivity to prevalence changes suggests that if infection rates rise in any origin, stricter early controls would be needed to prevent seeding; conversely, if prevalence decreases, mobility can be safely relaxed earlier. The strategy supports essential economic and social activities by relaxing controls progressively in states with high inflow but lower relative risk, while maintaining strict early controls for high-risk origins. This balances epidemic suppression with critical mobility needs, optimizing public health outcomes and economic stability in Arizona."

States with higher infection prevalence and larger inflows, like Texas, receive the strictest early controls to sharply reduce importation risks during weeks of highest vulnerability. States with moderate infection prevalence and inflow, such as Virginia, receive mid-level controls balancing risk and mobility. Low prevalence states with moderate inflow, like New Mexico and Arizona, are assigned a strict-first-then-relaxed pattern to control early seeding while allowing gradual reopening. This coordinated approach reduces overall imported infected individuals by front-loading restrictions when importation risk is highest, then easing to restore economic activities, preventing prolonged mobility suppression. Sensitivity to infection prevalence and inflow magnitude is critical; if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter controls may be warranted. Conversely, if local control improves, relaxation can accelerate. This policy ensemble mitigates epidemic risk through targeted, temporally dynamic controls respecting cross-state mobility patterns, optimizing public health outcomes and economic resilience.'

High-risk states like Mississippi with elevated prevalence receive strict early controls to prevent seeding local outbreaks. Arizona, with moderate prevalence but substantial flow, also adopts a strict-then-relaxed phased approach to mitigate early surge risks while easing later to support mobility. Texas, with very high flow but moderate prevalence, uses a consistent mid-strict approach to balance risk and economic activity, avoiding abrupt disruptions. Virginia¡¯s lower prevalence and flow justify a more relaxed mid-level control to preserve essential mobility. This cross-state coordination reduces the total imported infectious burden by frontloading restrictions where risk is highest and smoothing controls where risk is moderate, thus limiting peaks in imported infections. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter or longer initial controls would be needed, especially for high-flow states. Conversely, if local New Mexico immunity improves or beta decreases, relaxation could be accelerated. Overall, this multipronged approach harnesses epidemic data and mobility baselines to optimize New Mexico¡¯s inbound traffic policies for epidemic control and essential mobility."

States with higher infection prevalence relative to population and significant inflows (Mississippi, Arizona) receive the strictest early controls to sharply reduce incoming infectious individuals during peak risk periods, thereby protecting Texas¡¯s susceptible population and healthcare system. New Mexico¡¯s low infection prevalence combined with very high inflow favors a relaxed strategy to preserve essential mobility and economic activity without significantly increasing import risk. Virginia¡¯s moderate epidemic status warrants mid-level control focusing on the epidemic's critical phases to suppress potential surges. This coordinated approach leverages quantitative infection import logic: imported_infected ~ Flow * fraction * (I/pop), emphasizing early reduction of high-risk flows while gradually relaxing controls to balance epidemic and mobility needs. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter earlier controls would be necessary, especially for high-inflow states, to prevent seeding outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, controls could be eased more rapidly. This adaptive, data-driven strategy supports Texas's goal to minimize epidemiological impact while sustaining essential economic and social functions across a dynamic multi-state mobility network."

For the lower-prevalence New Mexico, a mid-strict approach balances risk and mobility. The importation risk is quantified as the product of inbound flow, infection fraction (I/population), and weekly fraction ft, guiding the selection of more stringent control measures upfront where risk is higher. Coordinated across states, these policies reduce cumulative imported cases and deaths in Virginia while allowing gradual relaxation to restore economic and social activities. Sensitivity analyses show that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter and longer-lasting controls would be warranted, while decreases would permit more relaxed policies. This adaptive approach ensures that epidemic control and essential mobility are balanced dynamically based on real-time epidemiological data and mobility patterns.'

States with higher infection prevalence and/or larger inbound flows (Mississippi and Texas) receive the strictest early control (S1), effectively reducing the initial influx of infected travelers when Arizona's local epidemic remains sensitive to seeding events. This temporal front-loading of restrictions limits early imported infections, which are critical to curbing exponential growth. New Mexico's low infection prevalence and high mobility justify a more relaxed mid-level control (S5), maintaining regional connectivity without significantly increasing risk. Virginia's moderate prevalence and lower flow receive a mid-strict pattern (S4) to dynamically balance risk and mobility. Across weeks, these patterns cooperate by staggering restrictions to avoid simultaneous peak mobility from all origins, thereby smoothing the burden on Arizona's public health systems. Sensitivity analyses reveal that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase in any origin state, early strict controls become even more critical to prevent import-driven outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence drops, relaxing controls earlier could be possible to support economic recovery. These strategies reflect a data-driven, adaptive approach, integrating epidemiological risk and mobility considerations to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Arizona."

Texas, with the highest infected count and inbound flow, receives the strictest early control (S1) to sharply reduce imported infections during the critical early weeks. Arizona, with moderate prevalence and flow, is similarly managed with strict early control but allows somewhat faster relaxation. New Mexico's low prevalence and flow justify a consistent mid-level restriction (S4) to maintain steady risk mitigation without excess mobility disruption. Virginia, despite having relatively high prevalence, has lower flow, allowing a more relaxed mid-level approach (S5) to balance risk and mobility. This allocation strategy leverages quantitative infection-import logic, where imported infected approximates flow * fraction * (I/pop), to prioritize restrictions where the product of prevalence and flow is highest. The phased fraction patterns also account for temporal epidemic dynamics, front-loading restrictions where necessary and relaxing as risk decreases or local controls improve. Sensitivity to beta and other epidemiological parameters suggests that if transmission rates increase, stricter or longer controls would be required, especially for high-flow, high-prevalence states like Texas. Conversely, if prevalence drops or testing and quarantine improve, controls could be more relaxed. This cooperative allocation across states optimizes epidemic control and essential mobility, minimizing imported infections and associated mortality risk to Mississippi."

Arizona, Mississippi, and Texas all exhibit significant infection levels and/or large travel volumes into New Mexico, justifying the S1_strict_first_then_relaxed pattern. This phased approach minimizes early epidemic seeding from these high-risk origins while gradually restoring mobility to support economic and social activities. Virginia, with lower inbound flow and moderate infection rates, is assigned a uniform control pattern to maintain a steady balance between epidemic control and mobility. Quantitatively, this allocation reduces imported infections as cumulative imported_infected ~ sum_over_states(flow * fraction * (I/pop)) is minimized early when the local epidemic is most vulnerable. Cooperation across weeks leverages temporal flexibility, imposing strict controls only when most epidemiologically necessary. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence were to increase in any origin state, stricter or extended controls would be warranted. Similarly, if transmission rates (beta) rise, the importance of strict early controls magnifies to prevent local outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence declines or mobility baselines shift downward, more relaxed patterns could be considered to enhance mobility without compromising control. Overall, this strategy set balances disease mitigation with socio-economic needs, adapting control intensity to origin state risk profiles and mobility volumes to protect New Mexico effectively.'

Mississippi, with the highest infection rate, demands the strictest control early on. New Mexico, with low infection prevalence but large mobility flows, is assigned a mid-strict approach to balance epidemic risk and essential mobility, preserving economic and social connectivity without excessive restrictions. The phased approach in S1 strategies enables dynamic adjustment over four weeks, reducing cumulative imported cases and deaths by targeting higher risk periods with low fractions, then relaxing controls to support mobility and social needs. Quantitatively, the imported infections scale with Flow * ft * (I/pop), so applying stricter ft early reduces the initial seeding of infections within Texas, which has substantial susceptible and infected populations itself. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) were to increase, stricter early controls become even more critical, while decreases allow more relaxed mobility. Coordinated multi-origin state controls optimize overall epidemic mitigation in Texas, avoiding overwhelming healthcare while sustaining essential inbound flow. This calibrated, risk-based policy mix is the best epidemiological and mobility trade-off for Texas moving forward.'

Mississippi, despite a lower inflow than Texas or Arizona, has a disproportionately high infection prevalence, necessitating strict early controls to mitigate importation risk. Texas and Arizona, with large inflows and moderate infection prevalence, require a strategy that aggressively limits inflow initially (S1) to protect Virginia's susceptible population during critical weeks, relaxing later to preserve mobility and economic activity. New Mexico's low prevalence and inflow allow a mid-level control, balancing risk and mobility. Collectively, these strategies reduce cumulative imported infections and deaths by prioritizing stricter controls where infection prevalence or mobility is highest, applying temporal modulation to adapt to evolving epidemic conditions. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase in any origin state, intensifying early restrictions would become more critical. Conversely, if prevalence falls or enhanced vaccination reduces beta, relaxation could be accelerated. This coordinated approach leverages temporal control patterns to optimize disease containment without unnecessarily compromising essential mobility."

High-prevalence or high-flow states like Mississippi and Texas adopt strict-first-then-relaxed strategies to curb initial importation risk while permitting gradual mobility recovery. New Mexico's low prevalence but high flow justifies a mid-relaxed approach to balance risk and essential mobility. Virginia's moderate risk and lower flow warrant a mid-strict pattern to maintain cautious control. This coordinated approach minimizes cumulative imported cases and deaths by front-loading restrictions during critical early weeks when Arizona's local epidemic remains vulnerable. The cooperation logic leverages the temporal variation in control fractions to distribute mobility allowances sensibly while managing epidemiological risk dynamically. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase in origin states, stricter or longer control periods would be necessary to maintain Arizona's epidemic stability. Conversely, declines in prevalence or improved local conditions could allow more relaxed patterns. The chosen strategies reflect a risk-adaptive, data-driven policy aiming to sustain essential cross-state mobility without compromising public health objectives."

Texas, with the highest infection prevalence and largest inflow, receives the strictest early control (S1_strict_first_then_relaxed) to sharply reduce imported infections during the critical initial week, gradually relaxing as risk potentially decreases. Arizona, with moderate risk and inflow, also adopts this phased approach but slightly less impactful given its lower prevalence. New Mexico's low prevalence and inflow justify moderate but steady restrictions (S4_mid_strict), reflecting a cautious but balanced approach. Virginia's moderate prevalence but lower inflow supports a more relaxed mid-term pattern (S5_mid_relaxed) to preserve mobility. This coordinated strategy reduces the aggregate imported infection pressure on Mississippi, distributing control efforts where most epidemiologically needed while maintaining essential mobility. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter or longer-term controls would be needed, especially for high-inflow states like Texas. Conversely, lower prevalence or improved local controls in Mississippi could allow more relaxed inbound flows. The dynamic use of phased controls balances epidemic suppression with socio-economic considerations, adapting to temporal changes in risk and mobility demand."

This phased strategy reduces cumulative infections and deaths in New Mexico by limiting high-risk transmissions early and gradually restoring mobility as risk diminishes. Virginia¡¯s lower inflow and moderate prevalence support a uniform control strategy, maintaining stable mobility without excessive risk. Quantitatively, the product of inflow, fraction allowed, and infection prevalence guides these choices, aiming to minimize imported infected individuals especially in the early weeks. This cooperative approach balances epidemic control and essential mobility, recognizing that overly strict immediate restrictions from all states would severely impact New Mexico¡¯s economy and social functions. Sensitivity to prevalence and transmission rate (beta) indicates that if prevalence increases or beta rises, stricter or longer controls may be needed, whereas improvements allow faster relaxation. The chosen strategies thus offer a flexible, data-driven framework to adapt to evolving epidemic conditions across origin states, optimizing public health outcomes while preserving critical mobility."

High-risk states with elevated infection prevalence and/or high inbound flows, such as Mississippi and Arizona, receive stricter controls initially (S1), reducing early imported cases when Texas's own epidemic burden is still significant. This phased relaxation allows for gradual economic normalization while managing risk. For New Mexico, the largest flow source but with low prevalence, a mid-strict strategy balances infection risk and mobility, avoiding overly harsh restrictions that would unduly affect travel and commerce. Virginia¡¯s moderate prevalence and lower flow justify a uniform control approach, maintaining steady but moderate restrictions. Together, these strategies create a coordinated, risk-adjusted approach that prioritizes reducing infection importation without imposing blanket restrictions that could severely disrupt essential mobility. Sensitivity to infection prevalence and flow means that if prevalence rises in any origin state, stricter early controls would be warranted, whereas declining prevalence may allow faster relaxation. Variations in transmission rate (beta) or changes in Texas's local epidemic status could require re-optimization of these strategies. Overall, strategic differentiated control based on quantitative infection-import risk and flow volumes optimizes the epidemic-mobility trade-off to protect public health and economic activity."

This approach leverages the principle that early, strong controls reduce the number of imported infections when infectious populations are significant, thus minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia. States with lower infection prevalence and smaller flows, like New Mexico, receive moderate but consistent restrictions to balance risk and mobility. The strategies collectively reduce the effective imported infected pool over the critical initial weeks, thereby lowering the probability of secondary outbreaks. Quantitatively, imported infected travelers are proportional to baseline flow, fraction ft, and infection prevalence; thus, reducing ft early in high-risk states is most impactful. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter or longer controls might be needed; conversely, if prevalence decreases, relaxation could be expedited. This coordinated, adaptive framework ensures Virginia¡¯s epidemic control while preserving essential mobility, leveraging temporal and spatial heterogeneity in source states¡¯ epidemic dynamics.'

States with high infection prevalence and/or large inflows (Texas, Mississippi) receive strict-first-then-relaxed patterns, sharply reducing importation risk early on when infections are most critical to control. Moderate-prevalence but high-mobility New Mexico uses mid-strict controls to balance risk with essential mobility. Lower-inflow Virginia applies mid-relaxed control reflecting its moderate risk and smaller contribution to importation. Quantitatively, the imported infected cases scale with inflow * ft * (I/pop), so varying ft over weeks strategically reduces cumulative infection inflow. Coordination across states ensures overall importation is minimized while preserving key economic and social links. Sensitivity analyses show that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) rises, stricter controls or longer durations would be warranted, while decreases allow for more relaxed patterns. This adaptive multi-state approach optimally balances epidemic control with mobility preservation, supporting Arizona¡¯s public health and economic resilience."

Texas and Arizona, with higher infected populations and large inbound flows, are subject to stricter initial control (S1 strict-first-then-relaxed) to sharply reduce early imported infections which are critical to controlling outbreaks locally. New Mexico, with lower infection prevalence but moderate flow, receives a mid-strict strategy, ensuring continued control without excessive disruption. Virginia, showing moderate risk, is assigned a more relaxed mid-term strategy to maintain economic connectivity while limiting risk. This coordinated allocation reduces total expected imported infections by applying tighter controls where prevalence and flow are highest and relaxing restrictions where risk is moderate or low, optimizing epidemic control and mobility preservation. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter controls would be necessary, particularly for high-flow states like Texas and Arizona. Conversely, if prevalence declines, relaxation can be accelerated. The week-by-week variations in flow fractions allow adaptive response to changing epidemic conditions, minimizing cumulative harm while maintaining essential travel and economic activity.'

High-prevalence, high-volume states such as Texas, Arizona, and Mississippi receive the strict-first-then-relaxed strategy, effectively reducing infection seeding when New Mexico is most vulnerable. This front-loading of restrictions accommodates epidemic control priorities early on, followed by gradual relaxation to preserve essential mobility. Virginia¡¯s lower inbound flow and moderate infection prevalence justify a uniform control pattern, balancing risk management and mobility without excessive constraints. Quantitatively, the strategies reduce the effective imported infected cases by adjusting fractions of baseline flows weighted by infection prevalence (I/population). This coordinated approach leverages temporal heterogeneity in control intensity to optimize cumulative case and death reductions, acknowledging that risk and mobility vary across states and over time. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence were underestimated or transmission (beta) increased, stricter and more prolonged controls might be necessary, especially for high-mobility states. Conversely, improved local controls or vaccination could allow for faster relaxation. Overall, the policies reflect a data-driven compromise between epidemic suppression and socio-economic needs, emphasizing early risk mitigation from high-risk origins and sustained but moderate control elsewhere.'

This approach minimizes the cumulative imported infections by reducing initial traffic fractions when infectious individuals are most likely to seed new outbreaks in Texas. The phased relaxation balances the necessity of epidemic control with the economic and social imperative to maintain essential mobility. By allocating stricter controls to states with elevated I/pop ratios and large inflows, Texas reduces the overall expected imported infectious pressure. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if transmission rates (beta) or prevalence increase sharply, early strict control becomes even more critical to prevent overwhelming Texas's healthcare system. Conversely, lower prevalence or reduced susceptibility in Texas might allow for earlier relaxation. The strategy reflects a coordinated, data-driven approach leveraging SEIQRD metrics and mobility baselines to optimally manage inter-state epidemic risk while sustaining vital economic functions."

The strict-first-then-relaxed (S1) approach is predominantly chosen for higher-risk states (Texas, Mississippi, Arizona) to aggressively curtail imported infections during Virginia's vulnerable initial period when its own infected population remains substantial. This allows Virginia to reduce secondary transmission chains seeded by travelers. New Mexico, with a comparatively low infection prevalence and lower flow, is managed with a mid-strict uniform policy (S4) to avoid unnecessarily stringent restrictions while still controlling risk. The cumulative effect is a coordinated temporal reduction in imported cases across states, balancing epidemic control and essential mobility. Sensitivity to infection prevalence and transmission parameters (beta) suggests that if prevalence spikes or beta increases, stricter or extended controls may be required, whereas improvements in local containment could allow faster relaxation. This approach strategically allocates inbound fractions to optimize epidemic-mobility trade-offs in a dynamic, multi-origin context."

Mississippi, with a high infection ratio and moderate flow, receives the strictest initial controls to prevent a surge of cases early on. New Mexico, with very low infection prevalence but high flow, gets a mid-relaxed pattern to maintain critical mobility with moderate risk mitigation. Texas, a large population with significant flow and moderate infection levels, is assigned a mid-strict strategy to balance the high importation risk against the economic necessity of movement. Virginia, with moderate infection and flow, is managed with uniform restrictions to smooth disease importation risk over time. Quantitatively, the imported infections are proportional to the product of flow, strategy fraction, and infection ratio, so reducing ft in higher-risk states early on greatly decreases cumulative imported cases. This cooperative multi-state temporal allocation reduces peak pressures on Arizona¡¯s healthcare system while preserving essential economic and social interactions. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase in origin states, stricter controls or earlier interventions would be necessary. Conversely, if prevalence declines, relaxation can be safely expedited. This flexible, data-driven approach optimally balances epidemic control and mobility preservation.'

High-risk states with larger infected proportions and higher inbound flows (Texas, Virginia) receive stricter or mid-strict controls initially, reducing the product of inbound flow, fraction, and infected proportion (Flow * ft * (I/pop)) to lower expected imported infections. Lower-risk states with smaller infected proportions and lower flows (Arizona, New Mexico) are assigned the strict-first-then-relaxed pattern to protect Mississippi early on while progressively restoring mobility. This phased relaxation across states and weeks allows for adaptive risk mitigation, balancing disease control and economic activity. Sensitivity to parameters like infection prevalence and transmission rate (beta) is critical; higher beta or prevalence would necessitate stricter or prolonged controls. Conversely, if prevalence declines, relaxation could be accelerated.

High-risk, high-volume origins like Arizona and Texas receive stronger or balanced controls to limit imported cases effectively, while lower-volume or moderate-risk states like Mississippi and Virginia are managed with stricter or moderately relaxed controls to preserve essential mobility. The weighted allocation across weeks enables adaptive control¡ªstricter initially to prevent immediate surge and gradually relaxing to reduce socio-economic disruption. Quantitatively, imported infections are proportional to inflow * fraction * infection prevalence (I/pop), so reducing fractions from high-prevalence origins early lowers cumulative infection importation. Cross-state cooperation in this pattern reduces overall epidemic pressure. Sensitivity to parameter changes (e.g., beta or prevalence fluctuations) suggests that if infection rates rise, stricter controls should be accelerated; if rates decline, relaxation can be earlier.

States with high infection prevalence and/or high inbound flow such as Mississippi and Arizona receive stricter early-week restrictions to rapidly curb initial importations, followed by gradual relaxation to restore mobility and economic activities. New Mexico, despite low prevalence, poses a risk due to its very high inbound flow; thus, a mid-strict strategy balances control and mobility. Virginia's moderate prevalence and flow justify uniform moderate controls to maintain steady epidemic mitigation without unnecessary disruption. This coordinated approach reduces cumulative imported infections by front-loading restrictions where risk is highest, while preserving essential mobility across all states. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter or more prolonged controls may be warranted, whereas decreases would allow for more relaxed strategies. This adaptive framework enables flexible policy adjustments responsive to evolving epidemic dynamics and mobility needs, optimizing public health protection and economic resilience."

Higher prevalence states with significant flows (Mississippi, Texas) receive stricter or phased strict control to reduce early imported infection risk when Virginia's local caseload remains substantial. Lower prevalence states with smaller flows (New Mexico) utilize more relaxed patterns to preserve mobility without significantly increasing risk. Arizona, with intermediate prevalence and flow, adopts a phased strict-first-then-relaxed strategy enabling dynamic adjustment to epidemic trends. This cross-state coordination leverages temporal control gradients to reduce cumulative imported infections over four weeks, balancing public health and socio-economic needs. Sensitivity to prevalence or transmission rates (beta) would adjust control stringency; higher beta or sudden surges would necessitate stricter, earlier controls to prevent overwhelming Virginia's healthcare system.
