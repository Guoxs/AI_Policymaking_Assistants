The weekly fraction allocation ensures that Texas can adapt to evolving epidemic dynamics by progressively relaxing controls, reducing socioeconomic disruption. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) increases in an origin state, stronger or prolonged restrictions would be necessary to prevent surges in Texas. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, the model allows for earlier relaxation to optimize mobility. This adaptive, risk-based approach is essential to balance epidemic control with maintaining critical economic and social activities in Texas."

  },
  "global_guidance": "The collective strategy selection prioritizes early strict control for states with moderate to high infection prevalence (Arizona, Mississippi, Virginia), mitigating the risk of seeding new outbreaks in Texas when imported infections would most critically impact epidemic dynamics. Mississippi, with the highest infection rate, demands the strictest control early on. New Mexico, with low infection prevalence but large mobility flows, is assigned a mid-strict approach to balance epidemic risk and essential mobility, preserving economic and social connectivity without excessive restrictions. The phased approach in S1 strategies enables dynamic adjustment over four weeks, reducing cumulative imported cases and deaths by targeting higher risk periods with low fractions, then relaxing controls to support mobility and social needs. Quantitatively, the imported infections scale with Flow * ft * (I/pop), so applying stricter ft early reduces the initial seeding of infections within Texas, which has substantial susceptible and infected populations itself. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) were to increase, stricter early controls become even more critical, while decreases allow more relaxed mobility. Coordinated multi-origin state controls optimize overall epidemic mitigation in Texas, avoiding overwhelming healthcare while sustaining essential inbound flow. This calibrated, risk-based policy mix is the best epidemiological and mobility trade-off for Texas moving forward."

Mississippi, with the highest infection rate, demands the strictest control early on. New Mexico, with low infection prevalence but large mobility flows, is assigned a mid-strict approach to balance epidemic risk and essential mobility, preserving economic and social connectivity without excessive restrictions. The phased approach in S1 strategies enables dynamic adjustment over four weeks, reducing cumulative imported cases and deaths by targeting higher risk periods with low fractions, then relaxing controls to support mobility and social needs. Quantitatively, the imported infections scale with Flow * ft * (I/pop), so applying stricter ft early reduces the initial seeding of infections within Texas, which has substantial susceptible and infected populations itself. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) were to increase, stricter early controls become even more critical, while decreases allow more relaxed mobility. Coordinated multi-origin state controls optimize overall epidemic mitigation in Texas, avoiding overwhelming healthcare while sustaining essential inbound flow. This calibrated, risk-based policy mix is the best epidemiological and mobility trade-off for Texas moving forward.'

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce the expected imported infections and deaths in Texas, the policy considers the combined epidemic risk from origin states weighted by their respective inbound flows and infection prevalences. States with high infection prevalence and/or high inbound flow such as Mississippi and Arizona receive stricter early-week restrictions to rapidly curb initial importations, followed by gradual relaxation to restore mobility and economic activities. New Mexico, despite low prevalence, poses a risk due to its very high inbound flow; thus, a mid-strict strategy balances control and mobility. Virginia's moderate prevalence and flow justify uniform moderate controls to maintain steady epidemic mitigation without unnecessary disruption. This coordinated approach reduces cumulative imported infections by front-loading restrictions where risk is highest, while preserving essential mobility across all states. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter or more prolonged controls may be warranted, whereas decreases would allow for more relaxed strategies. This adaptive framework enables flexible policy adjustments responsive to evolving epidemic dynamics and mobility needs, optimizing public health protection and economic resilience."
