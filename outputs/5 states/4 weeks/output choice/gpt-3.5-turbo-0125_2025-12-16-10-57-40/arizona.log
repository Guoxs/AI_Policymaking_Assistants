Given its moderate inbound flow to Arizona (~1920 daily), the risk of importing infections is notable. The approximate imported infected cases can be estimated as Flow * ft * (I/pop) which, for Mississippi, suggests a considerable potential for seeding new infections in Arizona if traffic is unrestricted. The S1 strategy, which enforces strict control initially (low fractions) then gradually relaxes, is optimal here to suppress immediate risk while allowing incremental resumption to balance mobility needs. This approach prioritizes epidemic control in the critical early weeks, reducing importation of cases, and thus minimizing cumulative infections and deaths in Arizona.

Its high inbound flow into Arizona (~30,254 daily) poses a significant mobility consideration. The estimated imported infections from New Mexico are thus moderate but multiplied by a large flow, creating a risk that must be managed carefully. The S5_mid_relaxed strategy, which balances mid-level restrictions with relaxation in the middle weeks, is suitable here to maintain essential mobility while still mitigating moderate risk. This pattern allows Arizona to benefit from New Mexico¡¯s lower prevalence by permitting more traffic early and mid-term, reducing economic disruption, but maintains some control to prevent sudden spikes in imported infections. The trade-off here leans more towards preserving mobility given New Mexico¡¯s lower infection prevalence."

For New Mexico, with lower prevalence but high flow, a mid-relaxed pattern (S5_mid_relaxed) maintains mobility while mitigating moderate risk. Virginia, with moderate prevalence and low flow, is managed with mid-strict control (S4_mid_strict) to balance risk and mobility.

With an average daily inbound flow of about 2444 people, the expected imported infections are proportional to flow * fraction * (I/pop). Choosing the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy, which enforces strict control initially and gradually relaxes it, balances early risk containment with later mobility needs. This approach suppresses initial imported infections when the epidemic risk is highest, reducing seeding events in Arizona. As local control strengthens, relaxing restrictions is justified to restore economic activity. The trade-off favors minimizing cumulative cases and deaths by front-loading strict measures, thus preventing exponential growth from imported cases."

The 'S4_mid_strict' strategy applies moderate restrictions fairly evenly over the four weeks, imposing a mid-level control that balances risk reduction with preserving essential mobility. This choice reflects the moderate risk by avoiding overly strict early constraints that could disrupt mobility unnecessarily, yet maintaining some level of control to minimize cumulative imported infections given the high flow volume."

Given the combination of moderate infection prevalence and very high mobility, the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy is appropriate to impose strong initial restrictions to sharply reduce imported infections at the epidemic's current peak risk, then gradually relax to support economic and social mobility.

This moderate risk and modest mobility justify a uniform traffic allocation strategy ('S3_uniform'), which distributes controls evenly across the four weeks.

New Mexico, with low infection prevalence but very high flow, receives a 'S4_mid_strict' moderate control approach to balance risk and mobility. Virginia, with moderate prevalence and low flow, uses a uniform strategy to maintain steady control. This coordinated approach leverages temporal variation in controls to reduce imported infections when risk is highest and relaxes them as local epidemic control improves. Quantitatively, expected imported infected cases per week are proportional to flow * fraction * (I/pop), so front-loading strict controls on higher-risk states curtails cumulative imported infections effectively.

With an average daily inflow of 1718 persons into Arizona, the potential importation of infection is non-trivial. Quantitatively, imported infected individuals approximate inflow * ft * (I/pop), so applying stricter controls initially (ft=0.12 in week 1) sharply reduces early imported infections when disease import risks are highest. Gradual relaxation in later weeks balances mobility needs while minimizing cumulative risk.
