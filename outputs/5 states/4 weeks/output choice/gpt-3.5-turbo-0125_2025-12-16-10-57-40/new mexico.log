Despite the low prevalence, Arizona's high inbound flow into New Mexico (23,793.52 daily) raises the risk of importing infections. Applying the formula imported_infected ¡Ö Flow * ft * (I/pop), where ft is the weekly fraction of allowed traffic, the strategy 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' effectively reduces initial imported infections by applying stricter controls in early weeks (ft=0.12, 0.21), then relaxing later as risk naturally diminishes or is better controlled locally.

Given the large average daily inbound flow into New Mexico (~30,279), the risk of importing infected individuals is non-negligible. The imported infected estimate can be approximated as Flow * fraction * (I/pop). The chosen 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy applies stricter controls early (12% and 21% of baseline flow in weeks 1 and 2) reducing immediate risk, then relaxes to allow more mobility later (31% and 36%). This balances epidemic control with economic and social needs, preventing sudden spikes in imported cases while gradually restoring mobility as local and external conditions improve. Uniform or relaxed-first strategies would risk higher initial importation, whereas overly strict sustained controls could unnecessarily harm mobility.

Despite a low average daily inbound flow into New Mexico (~1651), the elevated infection prevalence means even small flows can import substantial infections. The estimated imported infected is Flow * fraction * (I/pop), which remains critical here. Given this, a strict control initially helps minimize early week imports and reduces the risk of seeding outbreaks in New Mexico. The 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy is chosen to enforce stronger restrictions early on, gradually relaxing as situational awareness increases and local containment improves.

The average daily inbound flow to New Mexico is very low (~1,535), which limits the potential for infection import despite moderate prevalence. The uniform strategy 'S3_uniform' balances epidemic control and mobility equally over the 4 weeks. Given the low flow, strict early controls are less critical, and uniform allocation avoids unnecessary disruption to movement while maintaining consistent mitigation. This strategy reduces the risk of sudden import spikes by maintaining steady controls, which is appropriate given the moderate risk and low traffic volume. Choosing strict-first strategies would impose unnecessary early restrictions, and no control could increase risk slightly. Hence, uniform control is a balanced approach for Virginia's profile."

This phased approach minimizes early epidemic seeding from these high-risk origins while gradually restoring mobility to support economic and social activities. Virginia, with lower inbound flow and moderate infection rates, is assigned a uniform control pattern to maintain a steady balance between epidemic control and mobility. Quantitatively, this allocation reduces imported infections as cumulative imported_infected ~ sum_over_states(flow * fraction * (I/pop)) is minimized early when the local epidemic is most vulnerable. Cooperation across weeks leverages temporal flexibility, imposing strict controls only when most epidemiologically necessary. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence were to increase in any origin state, stricter or extended controls would be warranted. Similarly, if transmission rates (beta) rise, the importance of strict early controls magnifies to prevent local outbreaks.

Given its large average daily inflow to New Mexico (28077.19), the potential for importing infections is considerable. The imported infected estimate is proportional to the product of inflow, the fraction allowed (ft), and the infection prevalence (I/pop). By choosing a 'strict first then relaxed' strategy, we apply strong restrictions initially (12% of baseline flow) to sharply reduce imported infections when prevalence is high, then gradually relax controls to balance mobility needs.

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, these inbound traffic control strategies prioritize minimizing New Mexico's imported infections and deaths by tailoring restrictions to each origin state's epidemic risk and mobility volume. High-risk, high-volume origins like Arizona and Texas receive stronger or balanced controls to limit imported cases effectively, while lower-volume or moderate-risk states like Mississippi and Virginia are managed with stricter or moderately relaxed controls to preserve essential mobility. The weighted allocation across weeks enables adaptive control¡ªstricter initially to prevent immediate surge and gradually relaxing to reduce socio-economic disruption. Quantitatively, imported infections are proportional to inflow * fraction * infection prevalence (I/pop), so reducing fractions from high-prevalence origins early lowers cumulative infection importation. Cross-state cooperation in this pattern reduces overall epidemic pressure. Sensitivity to parameter changes (e.g., beta or prevalence fluctuations) suggests that if infection rates rise, stricter controls should be accelerated; if rates decline, relaxation can be earlier. This adaptive, data-driven multi-origin approach balances epidemic containment with mobility needs, optimizing public health outcomes for New Mexico."
