However, the large average inflow into Virginia (3457.43 daily) means even a small infected fraction could import significant cases. The imported infected estimate is roughly inflow * fraction * (I/pop). Applying a strict-first-then-relaxed strategy (S1) allows Virginia to minimize early imported infections during weeks 1 and 2, when containment is crucial, and gradually relax controls as local conditions improve. This phased approach balances disease mitigation and economic/mobility needs, preventing early spikes while not overly restricting flow long-term. Uniform or no control would risk significant imported infections initially, while overly strict policies throughout would unduly restrict mobility. Therefore, S1 best fits Arizona's risk profile given its moderate prevalence and substantial mobility link to Virginia."

The average daily inflow to Virginia is moderate at 3026.86. Due to Mississippi's relatively higher infection ratio, stricter control is warranted to reduce the importation risk. The mid-strict strategy (S4) applies consistent moderate restrictions across weeks 1 and 4, with a slight relaxation in the middle, balancing reductions in imported infections with preserving essential mobility. Compared to strict-first-then-relaxed, S4 maintains controls longer overall, reflecting Mississippi's higher epidemic risk. Uniform or no control would be risky given the elevated infection prevalence. Hence, S4 is recommended to carefully manage imported infections while allowing some mobility."

However, its average inflow into Virginia is much lower (1620.81 daily). Given the smaller mobility volume, a mid-relaxed strategy (S5) is appropriate, allowing somewhat more mobility in weeks 2 and 3 when initial epidemic risks are assessed and local controls adapt. This strategy slightly reduces initial strictness compared to S1 or S4 but still controls risk through moderate flow management. It balances the relatively higher prevalence with the smaller inflow volume, reducing unnecessary economic disruption but maintaining some epidemic control. Uniform or no control would not adequately consider the prevalence, while strict-first would overly restrict mobility given the lower flow."

However, its average daily inflow to Virginia is the highest at 16,201.9, which can potentially import infections if not controlled. Because of the large flow but low prevalence, a strict-first-then-relaxed strategy (S1) is optimal to reduce early imported infections when Virginia's local epidemic is sensitive. This approach limits initial risk while progressively relaxing control to maintain economic ties and mobility. No control or uniform strategies risk importing infections early on, while overly strict control throughout would unnecessarily hinder mobility. Thus, S1 balances epidemic risk and mobility needs effectively for Texas."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative infections and deaths in Virginia, the inbound traffic management strategy is tailored to each origin state's epidemic risk and mobility volume. States with moderate to high infection prevalence and significant inflow (Arizona, Mississippi, New Mexico, Texas) require phased or moderate traffic restrictions to reduce imported infections while preserving essential movement. The strict-first-then-relaxed strategy is chosen for Arizona and Texas, which have large inflows but lower or moderate infection prevalence, allowing early stringent controls that relax as local conditions improve. Mississippi's higher prevalence justifies a mid-strict uniform approach to balance sustained epidemic control and mobility. New Mexico's moderate prevalence but lower inflow supports a mid-relaxed pattern, permitting more mobility with manageable risk. This cooperative strategy reduces expected imported infections and deaths across weeks by front-loading restrictions where needed and gradually relaxing them, preventing epidemic resurgence. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter or longer-lasting controls may become necessary to prevent import-driven outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence drops, mobility could be further relaxed earlier. This approach balances epidemiological prudence with economic and social necessities, leveraging flow fractions to dynamically tune importation risk and preserve essential interstate connectivity."

The infected ratio (I/pop) is approximately 0.0001, which is low but non-negligible. The inbound flow to Virginia averages 5763.29 daily, implying imported infections roughly proportional to flow * fraction * (I/pop). Given the moderate infection level, a strategy that imposes stricter controls in the initial weeks to mitigate imported infections, followed by gradually relaxed restrictions, is appropriate. This allows Virginia to minimize early-stage seeding from Arizona while accommodating essential mobility later. The S1 pattern balances epidemic control with mobility preservation, reducing early risk without overly constraining travel long-term. This approach acknowledges Arizona's moderate risk and the significant travel volume to Virginia, aiming to minimize imported cases while allowing economic and social activities to resume progressively."

The daily inbound flow to Virginia is about 5376, which could translate to significant imported infections if unmitigated. Given this elevated epidemic pressure, a strong initial control (low fraction) is crucial to curtail imported infections early. The S1 strategy, with strict control first then gradual relaxation, best matches this profile. It enables early suppression of transmission risk from a relatively high-prevalence source while balancing mobility needs over time. This approach helps protect Virginia's population from a potentially substantial influx of exposed and infected individuals, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths while enabling phased reopening. The trade-off is early reduced mobility from Mississippi, justified by the higher local epidemic intensity."

Arizona, with moderate prevalence and large flow, also adopts S1 to balance risk and mobility. Low-prevalence New Mexico receives a more relaxed strategy (S5_mid_relaxed), preserving essential mobility with moderate caution. This coordinated approach reduces the cumulative expected imported infections by lowering flow fractions during early weeks when outbreaks are most sensitive to imported cases, thereby flattening potential secondary waves in Virginia. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, the benefit of early strict controls amplifies, reinforcing the chosen initial strict strategies for higher-risk states.

Using the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * fraction * (I/pop), stricter controls early (low fractions in early weeks) reduce initial imported cases when Virginia's own infection burden remains high.

The inbound flow to Virginia is moderate at 3822.76. The product of flow and infection prevalence suggests Mississippi poses a higher risk of importing infections. Hence, applying the S1 strict-first strategy is prudent to sharply curtail imported cases initially, reducing seeding of new infections in Virginia when its own epidemic is still active. This approach balances epidemic control and mobility, allowing gradual relaxation as the situation stabilizes.
