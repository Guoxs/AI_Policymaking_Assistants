States with higher infected proportions (Mississippi, Virginia) adopt strict-first patterns with lower traffic fractions initially to curb early imported infections. States with lower infection risk (New Mexico, Arizona) maintain either even or relaxed-first patterns to support economic activity without significantly increasing risk. The total inbound flows per state remain constant over 4 weeks, distributing traffic to minimize importation peaks. This cooperative cross-state adjustment reduces overall imported infection risk by flattening inbound infection pressure temporally and spatially. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter control in early weeks becomes more critical, while lower prevalence allows more relaxed policies. The approach ensures the fractions sum exactly to 1 for each state, maintaining total mobility volume but reallocating weekly shares for epidemic control. Overall, this policy harmonizes epidemic mitigation and mobility preservation by leveraging state-specific infection dynamics and flow baselines.'

    "notes": "Arizona has a large susceptible population (8.5M) with moderate exposed (93K) and low infected (6K) individuals relative to its population. The risk of importing infected individuals is proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), so controlling flows during weeks with higher infection pressure is crucial. Given the steady but moderate infection level, a strict-first pattern is chosen: more stringent control in the first two weeks (fractions 0.35, 0.30) to reduce initial imported infections, then gradually relaxing control (0.20, 0.15). This pattern balances epidemic control and mobility by front-loading restrictions when risk is higher, allowing economic activity later. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000, validating allocation."

We apply a strict-first pattern, allocating heavier restrictions early (0.40, 0.30) to sharply reduce incoming infections, then easing later (0.20, 0.10). This approach minimizes early infections that could seed Texas outbreaks. The sum of fractions is exactly 1.000, ensuring consistent traffic control."

Given this stable and low prevalence, an even pattern is selected, distributing traffic evenly across all four weeks (0.25 each). This allows maintaining mobility without significantly raising epidemic risk. The formula Flow*ft*(I/pop) supports this balanced approach due to low infection prevalence.

The quantitative logic relies on the formula imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), which guides traffic fraction adjustments to reduce expected cases.
