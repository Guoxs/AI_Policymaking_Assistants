Given the sizable daily inflow (19166.81) to New Mexico, imported infections approximately scale with Flow * fraction * (I / Population), i.e., roughly proportional to 19166.81 * ft * (962/7,272,180). The infected fraction is low (~0.013%), suggesting moderate risk. We adopt a relaxed-first pattern (lower ft early weeks, higher later) to reduce peak imported infections early, allowing epidemic pressure in Arizona to be observed and controlled. This pattern balances economic and social mobility needs with disease control. The fractions sum to 1 exactly (0.20+0.25+0.30+0.25=1.00), ensuring consistency with the constant total inflow constraint."

An even allocation pattern balances control and mobility, avoiding sharp shifts that might disrupt travel patterns unnecessarily.

The relaxed-first pattern is chosen, with strictest control early (f1=0.15), gradually relaxing to f4=0.35, to delay and reduce peak imported infections when prevalence might be higher or less certain.

The imported infected estimate follows roughly Flow*ft*(I/population), where Flow is 30278.76 daily. Preserving total flow over 4 weeks, we apply a 'relaxed-first' pattern: initially stricter controls (f1=0.15) to reduce early seeding in New Mexico, then gradually easing (f2 to f4). This leverages lower early risk and allows for mobility recovery later while balancing epidemic control. The fractions sum exactly to 1, ensuring flow conservation. Trade-offs involve balancing economic and social mobility with epidemic risk mitigation, prioritizing early reductions in imported infection to delay spread in New Mexico."

States with higher infected proportions or exposed counts (Mississippi and Virginia) have stricter controls later or even distribution to mitigate risk over time, while states with larger populations but lower prevalence (Arizona, Texas) have more relaxed early controls but stricter later phases, reflecting potential epidemic trends and incubation periods. This temporal redistribution smooths imported infection risk, preventing spikes that could overwhelm New Mexico's healthcare. Quantitatively, imported infections are proportional to Flow * fraction * (I/population), so adjusting fractions redistributes risk without changing total flow volume, preserving economic activity. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early restrictions become more critical to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, improvements in source states' epidemic conditions could allow relaxation. This policy thus dynamically balances epidemic control and mobility, reducing cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico by leveraging temporal and cross-state cooperation."

With a large baseline flow and substantial infectious prevalence, a moderate consistent control is warranted to avoid sudden spikes. Allocating the inbound flow evenly across the 4 weeks (even pattern) balances mobility needs and infection risk, preventing overwhelming healthcare resources or sudden outbreaks.

To mitigate peak importation risk while allowing some mobility, a strict-first pattern is chosen: stricter control early (weeks 1 and 4 with 0.20 fractions), relaxed control mid-period (weeks 2 and 3 with 0.30), flattening infection influx.

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy distributes the inbound flows from origin states to New Mexico over 4 weeks to minimize cumulative infections and deaths.

Mississippi, with a smaller population but higher infection prevalence, uses a strict-first pattern prioritizing early suppression of importations to limit seeding effects. Virginia, with moderate risk and low flow, adopts an even pattern for steady control. This cross-state coordination reduces cumulative imported infections by smoothing arrival of cases over time, preventing healthcare overload.

The ratio of infected to population suggests a moderate risk of importing infections. Expected imported infected cases per week ~ Flow * fraction * (I / population), thus concentrating stricter controls early can reduce initial imported cases.
