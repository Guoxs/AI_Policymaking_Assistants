Given the moderate risk and relatively low daily inflow, an even distribution (equal fractions 0.25 each week) is chosen to balance mobility and epidemic control, avoiding sudden spikes that could overwhelm control efforts.

By reducing flow fractions in the initial weeks, especially from high-risk origins, Arizona minimizes imported infections when local control is critical. Gradual relaxation in later weeks permits recovery of mobility and economic activity without compromising epidemic control. The allocation balances the trade-off between minimizing infections and deaths and sustaining essential travel. Quantitatively, imported infections approximate Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing ft when Flow and I/population are high effectively lowers imported cases. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early-week controls would be warranted, whereas if prevalence declines, more even or relaxed patterns could be adopted. This coordinated cross-state approach optimizes risk distribution over time and sources, minimizing peaks of imported infections and aiding Arizona's epidemic management."

By reducing flow fractions in the initial weeks, especially from high-risk origins, Arizona minimizes imported infections when local control is critical. Gradual relaxation in later weeks permits recovery of mobility and economic activity without compromising epidemic control. The allocation balances the trade-off between minimizing infections and deaths and sustaining essential travel. Quantitatively, imported infections approximate Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing ft when Flow and I/population are high effectively lowers imported cases. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early-week controls would be warranted, whereas if prevalence declines, more even or relaxed patterns could be adopted. This coordinated cross-state approach optimizes risk distribution over time and sources, minimizing peaks of imported infections and aiding Arizona's epidemic management."

The imported infected cases roughly scale with Flow * fraction * (I / population). Given the steady inflow and consistent infection pressure, an even distribution of traffic control (equal fractions) across the four weeks minimizes abrupt changes and allows stable monitoring and response. Balancing the economic and social necessities with epidemic control, a strict-first or relaxed-first pattern is less favorable here due to no strong trend in infection prevalence changes.

The inbound flow from New Mexico is quite large (30556.48 daily), so careful timing can reduce risk while preserving mobility. The increasing fraction pattern (strict-first) delays higher inflow to later weeks, allowing Arizona's epidemic control measures to adapt and reduce imported infections progressively. Imported infected cases scale with Flow * fraction * (I / population). This pattern balances epidemic control with economic needs by initially restricting inflow when risk is higher and relaxing later when either prevalence or Arizona's capacity improves.

The inbound flow is lower (5287.62) but infection pressure is considerable. The strict-first pattern (higher control early) helps reduce initial imported infections given the high exposed cases. The fractions decrease over time reflecting a cautious approach that gradually relaxes control as the situation presumably improves or stabilizes.

The imported infected cases can be approximated by Flow * ft * (I / total population), indicating that even distribution reduces risk spikes. The even pattern is chosen as infection pressure is steady without a clear trend of increasing or decreasing cases, balancing mobility and epidemic control evenly over 4 weeks.

Lower prevalence states (New Mexico) have stricter-first patterns to front-load control when risk is potentially higher. Even distribution is chosen for Mississippi due to steady infection levels.
