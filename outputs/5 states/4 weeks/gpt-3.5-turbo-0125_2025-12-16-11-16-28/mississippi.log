The infection prevalence proportion is approximately I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D) = 962/(7,272,180 + 1,952 + 962 + 3,319 + 186 + 118) which is very low, indicating low infectious pressure. The inbound flow to Mississippi from Arizona is moderate (average 1,471.52 daily). Expected imported infections roughly scale as Flow * ft * (I / population), so with low infection prevalence, the risk per traveler is low. Given this, an even distribution (f1 = f2 = f3 = f4 = 0.25) of traffic controls over the 4 weeks is chosen to balance economic mobility and epidemic control. Relaxing or tightening controls unevenly is not justified by the data since infection pressure is steady and low. The fractions sum exactly to 1, validating the allocation."

Expected imported infected cases scale as Flow * ft * (I/population), so reducing traffic earlier can reduce early imported cases and help control spread. Here, a strict-first pattern is selected, with lower fractions in weeks 1 and 2 (0.20 each) and relaxed controls in weeks 3 and 4 (0.30 each). This pattern delays potential infections importation and reduces initial seeding, allowing Mississippi better epidemic control. The fractions sum to 1 exactly."

To minimize early seeding, a strict-first pattern with strongest control in week 1 (0.10) and progressively relaxed control is used: fractions 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, 0.40.

States with lower infection prevalence but significant flow volumes (Texas and Arizona) have allocations that gradually relax controls over the 4 weeks, balancing mobility restoration and epidemic risk. The quantitative cooperation logic here hinges on the importation risk formula: imported_infected ¡Ö Flow * ft * (I / population). By adjusting ft weekly per origin state, we modulate the timing and volume of potential imported infections. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls would be even more critical to reduce seeding. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, controls could be relaxed earlier to restore mobility. This coordinated, data-driven approach optimizes overall risk reduction by preventing synchronously high importation from multiple states, thus reducing the likelihood of outbreak amplification within Mississippi."

The exposed count (E=13108) is moderately high, indicating potential upcoming infections. Calculating imported infections as Flow * ft * (I / population), the risk is moderate but not negligible. The traffic allocation follows a relaxed-first pattern, gradually increasing flow in weeks 3 and 4 as infection pressure is expected to be controlled or monitored effectively. This balances epidemic control by reducing early week inflow when potential latent cases may increase risk, and later relaxing controls to allow economic mobility.

Quantitatively, the imported infection risk depends on Flow * fraction * (I / Population). By adjusting fractions weekly, we reduce infection importation when Mississippi's local epidemic burden is high, and relax controls as the local situation improves. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase in origin states, stricter early restrictions should be prioritized; conversely, if these parameters decrease, more relaxed patterns can be adopted. This cooperative allocation across origin states collectively reduces the risk of secondary outbreaks and deaths in Mississippi while supporting essential mobility needs."

The infection prevalence (I/population) is low (~0.0007), but the exposed population is quite high, indicating potential risk for future infections. The expected imported infections can be approximated by Flow*ft*(I/population). Since Arizona's infection pressure is relatively steady, an even distribution of traffic (even pattern) is chosen to balance mobility and epidemic control. This avoids sharp fluctuations in control measures that might disrupt travel or economy. The fractions sum exactly to 1.0, preserving the total inbound flow while smoothing risk over the 4 weeks."

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic control strategy for Mississippi distributes flow restrictions to minimize imported infections and deaths while balancing economic and social mobility needs.

Lower prevalence states (Arizona, New Mexico) have more balanced or relaxed early flows, supporting travel and commerce.

Quantitatively, expected imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/population), so adjusting weekly fractions ft directly modulates risk. Sensitivity analysis shows that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter and more front-loaded controls become necessary to prevent overwhelming local healthcare.
