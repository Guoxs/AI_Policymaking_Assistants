The risk of importing infections is proportional to the infected ratio (I/S+E+I+Q+R+D), and given the moderate infection prevalence, a uniform (even) pattern is chosen to balance mobility and epidemic control.

    "notes": "Arizona has a moderate number of infected individuals (I=6060) relative to a large susceptible population (S=8511481). The infection prevalence is low but non-negligible. The expected imported infected can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)), so spreading out the traffic evenly or slightly stricter towards the end weeks helps reduce peak importation risk. We use a slight 'strict-last' pattern (lower fraction in week 4) anticipating potential increases in cases or seasonal effects later. This balances epidemic control by reducing late inflows when local Virginia cases might rise, while allowing reasonable mobility early on. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.25+0.30+0.25+0.20=1.00), ensuring total inflow is conserved."

Using the formula imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), higher flows later weeks may increase risk. Hence, we adopt a 'relaxed-later' pattern to ease mobility later but keep controls stricter earlier (week 1 fraction low). This allows initial epidemic suppression while recognizing economic and social needs in later weeks. The fractions sum to 1 (0.15+0.25+0.30+0.30=1.00), maintaining inflow totals."

The imported infected is low even at higher flows. We choose a mild 'strict-middle' pattern with slightly increased flows in weeks 2 and 3 to capitalize on low infection pressure and maintain mobility, while slightly restricting week 1 and 4 to hedge against uncertainties.

    "notes": "Texas has the highest infected count (I=24171) and large susceptible base (S=22342385), posing a significant risk of importing infection to Virginia. The daily flow is also the highest among origin states. To minimize imported infections, a 'relaxed-last' pattern is selected, gradually increasing fractions from week 1 to 4. This allows tighter control initially when Virginia's current infections are considerable, delaying relaxation until later weeks when local capacity may improve or vaccination may increase. The fractions sum to 1 (0.10+0.20+0.30+0.40=1.00), preserving total inflow."

  "global_guidance": "The traffic control strategy across all origin states aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia by strategically timing the inbound flow. States with higher infection prevalence and/or higher infected numbers (Texas, Mississippi) have more conservative early-week controls, reducing infection importation risk when Virginia's epidemic burden is already substantial. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure (New Mexico, Arizona) have more balanced or slightly relaxed patterns to maintain essential mobility while still controlling risk. The total inbound flows remain constant to preserve economic and social ties, but temporal redistribution reduces peak imported infections by smoothing inflow timing. This cooperative approach balances epidemic control and mobility needs, preventing overwhelming Virginia's healthcare system. Sensitivity analysis suggests if infection prevalence or transmission (beta) increases, stricter early-week controls would be beneficial, especially from high-risk states. Conversely, lower prevalence or faster recovery (gamma) might allow more relaxed patterns. This adaptive policy framework ensures responsiveness to evolving epidemic dynamics both locally and in origin states."

    "notes": "Arizona shows moderate infection levels with I=8982 relative to its large population (~8 million). The estimated imported infection per week is roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/Population). With this, we anticipate that front-loading strict measures (lower ft in early weeks) can reduce initial imported infections. The pattern chosen is relaxed-first because the infections show moderate stability and we can afford some relaxation in early weeks to balance mobility, while tightening slightly in the mid weeks to contain any surge. The total fractions sum to exactly 1. This approach balances reducing imported cases while preserving some inbound flow in the first week to not overly harm mobility."

    "notes": "Mississippi has a relatively high infected fraction (I=16168 out of ~333k susceptible), indicating higher risk per traveler. The imported infected is roughly Flow*ft*(I/Population), which is significant given the smaller population base, so stricter control early is justified. The strict-first pattern is chosen to delay and reduce initial imported infections, with gradual relaxation as weeks progress. The fractions sum to 1 exactly. This pattern reduces immediate risk while allowing gradual mobility restoration."

An even distribution of traffic control is chosen to maintain stable mobility without undue restrictions. The imported infected risk is uniformly low, so no need for front-loading or back-loading restrictions. Fractions sum to 1 exactly."

    "notes": "Texas shows high infected number (I=30072) and large population (~20M), but the infection rate is moderate. Given the large inflow volume, imported infections can be significant early on. A strict-first pattern is chosen, applying stricter control in the first two weeks to reduce initial imported infections and relaxing later as risks stabilize or decline. The fractions sum to 1 exactly. This balances epidemic control with economic mobility needs."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocations across origin states collectively aim to minimize imported infections and subsequent deaths in Virginia by modulating weekly allocations based on infection prevalence and flow volume. States with higher infected prevalence or smaller populations receive stricter early restrictions (strict-first pattern) to reduce immediate importation risk, while states with lower prevalence or large populations use even or relaxed-first patterns to balance mobility. This cooperative balancing reduces cumulative imported cases by spreading risk over time and avoiding simultaneous high inflows from all states. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls would be more beneficial. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, relaxed patterns could be adopted. This approach provides a flexible framework adapting to epidemic dynamics, balancing epidemic control and mobility needs."
