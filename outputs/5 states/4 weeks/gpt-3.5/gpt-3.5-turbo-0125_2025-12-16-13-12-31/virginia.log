Given the relatively stable but significant infection pressure, a relaxed-first pattern is chosen, increasing inbound flow gradually to avoid sudden spikes while allowing some economic activity. The fractions sum to 1 exactly (0.20+0.25+0.30+0.25=1). This balances epidemic control by initially restricting flow when risk is moderate and then relaxing controls as possibly conditions improve or to distribute risk over time."

The imported infections scale with Flow * ft * (I / population), so stricter control earlier (low ft) reduces initial risk. A relaxed-first pattern is chosen to reduce early importation risk while allowing gradual normalization. The fractions sum to 1 (0.15+0.20+0.30+0.35=1) ensuring total flow is maintained.

A relaxed-first pattern is chosen to start with stricter controls (low ft) and gradually relax to manage risk while enabling mobility. Fractions sum to 1 (0.10+0.15+0.30+0.45=1).

  },
  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocation across origin states prioritizes early stricter control for states with higher infection prevalence or higher absolute infected counts (like Mississippi and Texas) to reduce imported infections and deaths in Virginia. Arizona and Texas, having larger infected populations, see a gradual relaxation pattern, balancing epidemic control with mobility demands. New Mexico, with low infection pressure, maintains even flow. The sum of fractions for all states equals 1, preserving total inbound flow. This coordinated strategy reduces peak imported infection loads and spreads travel demand to avoid overwhelming health systems. If infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls would be warranted. Conversely, if prevalence declines, more relaxed patterns would be feasible. This approach is sensitive to changes in epidemic dynamics and balances health and economic considerations by adjusting weekly inbound flows accordingly."

    "notes": "Arizona shows a relatively high number of exposed (E=142607) and confirmed cases (Q=209519) compared to its infected (I=9108), indicating ongoing transmission and detection. The imported infected can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)), so front-loading stricter controls reduces early imported infections. We choose a strict-first pattern (higher control in weeks 1 and 2) because this reduces initial seeding in Virginia while allowing some relaxation later as Arizona's epidemic may improve or be monitored. Trade-offs involve reducing economic activity early but likely preventing exponential growth in Virginia. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.35+0.30+0.20+0.15=1)."

The strictest control is in week 1 (0.40), then gradually relaxed. This helps prevent seeding into Virginia early, where local transmission is significant.

The imported infected is proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), so early strict control reduces initial seeding. We adopt a strict-first pattern with higher control in weeks 1 and 2, gradually relaxing later to balance economic and epidemic considerations.

  "global_guidance": "The collective policy emphasizes stricter controls in the initial weeks (strict-first pattern) for higher-risk origin states (Arizona, Mississippi, Texas) and a more balanced, slightly relaxed approach for lower-risk New Mexico. This reduces the cumulative imported infections during the critical early period when Virginia's local epidemic could be exacerbated. The risk balancing is achieved by allocating lower fractions in weeks 1-2 for high-risk states, thus flattening the influx curve and lowering initial seeding. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase in origin states, stricter early controls would be even more beneficial. Conversely, if prevalence is lower, more even or relaxed patterns could be considered to reduce economic impact. This strategy aims to minimize the total infections and deaths in Virginia by controlling importation timing and magnitude while keeping total inbound flow constant per state over 4 weeks."
