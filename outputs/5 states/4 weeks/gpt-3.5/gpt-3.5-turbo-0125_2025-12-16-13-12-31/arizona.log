Allocating slightly more traffic in early weeks (f1=f2=0.30) and less in later weeks (f3=f4=0.20) follows a strict-last pattern, anticipating possible reduction in local New Mexico prevalence or Arizona's improved control.

    "notes": "Mississippi has a moderate number of infected (I=9199) relative to its population (~6.6M), with a non-negligible exposed group (E=25463). The imported infections per week can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population), indicating higher risk when the infected proportion is large. Given the moderate infection pressure, a strict-first pattern is chosen to front-load travel restrictions and reduce immediate importation risk. This helps mitigate seeding new cases early on while allowing gradual relaxation. The trade-off balances epidemic control with maintaining some mobility in later weeks. The fractions sum precisely to 1, validating the allocation."

Imported infections scale with Flow * ft * (I/population) and thus risk is moderate. We apply a strict-first pattern to limit early influxes while gradually relaxing controls to sustain mobility. This approach balances epidemic control and economic activity. The fractions add to exactly 1, ensuring consistent total inbound flow."

Using equal weekly fractions (even pattern) spreads risk uniformly, avoiding spikes in imported infections and providing consistent control. This strategy balances epidemic control and mobility without abrupt changes. The fractions sum exactly to 1, confirming feasibility."

Imported infections depend on Flow * ft * (I/population). A strict-first pattern is chosen to aggressively reduce early importation and prevent seeding outbreaks in Arizona. Gradual relaxation later balances control with necessary mobility. The fractions sum perfectly to 1, validating the allocation."

  "global_guidance": "The collective strategy applies stricter inbound flow controls in the initial weeks for higher-risk states (mississippi, new mexico, virginia) and distributes traffic more evenly for texas due to its moderate relative prevalence. This reduces peak importation risk and cumulative infections in Arizona by lowering early seeding potential. Quantitatively, the approach balances Flow * ft * (I/population) across weeks and states, mitigating epidemic importation while maintaining overall inbound volume consistent with ground truth. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta rises, stricter early restrictions become more critical to prevent exponential spread. Conversely, lower prevalence would allow more relaxed patterns. The policy is designed to be adaptive, prioritizing early suppression of imported infections to minimize deaths and confirmed cases in Arizona, while preserving economic mobility over the 4-week horizon."

    "notes": "Mississippi shows a moderate number of infected (I=13345) relative to its population (~6.6M). The imported infected cases roughly scale as Flow*ft*(I/population). Given its modest inflow (2159.29 daily), early weeks pose higher risk due to current infection prevalence. Thus, a strict-first pattern is chosen, reducing week 1 and 2 inflow fractions (0.35, 0.30), then relaxing later (0.20, 0.15) as infection pressure lowers or stabilizes. This balances epidemic control by front-loading restrictions to curb immediate imported infections but maintains total flow constant. Fractions sum to exactly 1, ensuring flow conservation."

Due to the low prevalence and stable infection pressure, an even distribution of traffic over the 4 weeks minimizes sudden spikes in imported infections. The imported infected estimate scales as Flow*ft*(I/population), and even fractions help spread risk evenly, allowing steady mobility and control. Fractions sum to 1 exactly to preserve total flow."

Given the moderately high infection prevalence, a relaxed-first pattern is adopted, slightly easing traffic in weeks 3 (0.30) and 4 (0.25) compared to stricter controls initially (week 1 at 0.20). This pattern mitigates early imported infections when risk is higher and benefits from potential epidemic improvements later. Trade-offs balance epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs. Fractions sum to 1 exactly."

A strict-first pattern is chosen to front-load controls and reduce initial imported infections, allocating fractions [0.40, 0.30, 0.20, 0.10] decreasing over weeks. This helps flatten the infection curve in Arizona by reducing early exposure and deaths. Fractions sum to 1 exactly, preserving total flow."
  },
  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce imported infections and deaths in Arizona, traffic control policies prioritize stricter controls earlier in the 4-week horizon for higher risk origin states (mississippi, virginia) and moderate initial restrictions for large flow states with moderate infection prevalence (texas). New Mexico, with low infection prevalence, distributes flow evenly to maintain mobility without spiking risk. This cross-state allocation balances total inbound flow constraints while minimizing peak imported infections. The quantitative logic uses the formula imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), and adjusting ft over weeks spreads or concentrates risk. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early restrictions become more critical. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed patterns can be adopted. This adaptive approach allows Arizona to dynamically manage epidemic risk while sustaining essential mobility."
