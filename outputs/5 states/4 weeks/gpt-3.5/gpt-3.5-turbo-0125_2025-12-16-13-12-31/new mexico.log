    "notes": "Arizona exhibits a high number of exposed (E=94508) and infected (I=6059) individuals relative to its population, indicating elevated infection pressure. The expected imported infected cases roughly scale with Flow*ft*(I/population). Arizona's large flow (28008.81 daily) into New Mexico necessitates careful allocation. We choose a relaxed-first pattern, slightly increasing flow in weeks 3 and 4 when local New Mexico infection control may be better, to reduce immediate importation risk. This balances mobility and epidemic control by deferring more inbound traffic to later weeks with potentially lower risk. The fractions sum precisely to 1.000."

Flow is low (1016.95 daily), but per capita risk imported is significant. We adopt a relaxed-first pattern, pushing more traffic to weeks 3 and 4 to reduce early importation risk. The increasing fractions reflect expected reduction in local New Mexico susceptibility and allow some travel resumption later. This trade-off favors epidemic control early while preserving some mobility later. Fractions total exactly 1.000."

The imported infected cases scale with Flow*ft*(I/population). A relaxed-first pattern is chosen to suppress early week traffic, minimizing immediate imported infections during peak risk, then gradually relax controls in weeks 3 and 4 as local New Mexico dynamics improve.

Given the relatively low flow and balanced prevalence, an even distribution of traffic across all four weeks is appropriate, avoiding unnecessary restriction but maintaining steady control. This even pattern balances epidemic control and mobility evenly. Fractions precisely sum to 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocations prioritize reducing early-week importation risk from states with high infection pressure and/or high flow to New Mexico, especially Texas and Arizona, by enforcing stricter early traffic controls and gradually relaxing in later weeks. This staggered approach minimizes peak imported infections and deaths in New Mexico, leveraging the natural epidemic progression and local control improvements. Lower flow states like Mississippi and Virginia have more moderate or even distributions to balance epidemic risk with mobility needs. Quantitatively, the scheme reduces expected imported infections by weighting flows ft inversely with infection prevalence and flow magnitude early on, then easing controls as local susceptibility decreases. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or beta increases, stricter early controls would be even more critical; conversely, if prevalence drops, a more even distribution could be considered. This coordinated inter-state control policy optimizes epidemic mitigation while preserving essential mobility over the 4-week horizon."

    "notes": "Arizona shows a moderate infected population (I=9108) and a large susceptible population (S=8,477,510). The imported infected cases roughly scale as Flow*ft*(I/population), so evenly distributing traffic controls (equal fractions) avoids creating a surge in any particular week. This even pattern balances mobility needs with epidemic control, as no strong trend in Arizona's infection pressure suggests favoring strict-first or relaxed-first patterns.
