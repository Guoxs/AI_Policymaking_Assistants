    "notes": "Arizona shows moderate infection prevalence with I=6059 among a large population (~9 million). The estimated imported infected cases scale as Flow*ft*(I/population). Given relatively stable infection levels and moderate inbound flow (1731.81 daily), an even distribution (even pattern) of traffic control over the 4 weeks balances economic activity with epidemic control. This avoids surges of imported infections early or late, minimizing risk of spikes. The sum of fractions equals 1.000, validating the allocation."

However, E is moderate (8830), suggesting some latent risk. The inbound flow is lower (1372.38 daily). We choose a relaxed-first pattern with increasing fractions in weeks 3 and 4 to allow some mobility recovery later after initial stricter controls. This staggers imported infections and helps avoid early strain on Mississippi's healthcare. The fractions sum to 1 exactly."

This means imported infections could be significant.

Gradually relaxing controls allows some economic activity later while minimizing early epidemic seeding. Fractions sum exactly to 1."

Early moderate relaxation balances economic needs but later restrictions prevent resurgence. Fractions sum to 1 exactly."

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic control policies balance epidemic risks and mobility needs across origin states. States with higher infection prevalence and larger flows (Texas) receive stricter early restrictions, reducing imported infections when Mississippi's own infections are still high. States with lower prevalence or flows (New Mexico) have more relaxed later periods to recover mobility. The even pattern for Arizona balances moderate risk across weeks. This staggered approach reduces peak imported infection pressure, minimizing total cases and deaths. Sensitivity analysis shows that if prevalence or beta increases, stricter early controls become more critical. Conversely, if prevalence drops, relaxed patterns may be adopted earlier to aid economic recovery. The policies ensure total inbound flow over 4 weeks remains constant per state, satisfying epidemiological and mobility constraints."

    "notes": "Arizona has a moderate infected population (I=9108) relative to its large population (approx. 8.6 million), leading to a low prevalence rate. The imported infected cases roughly follow the formula: imported_infected ~ Flow * fraction * (I / population). Given the stable infection numbers and moderate risk, an even allocation pattern is chosen to distribute traffic control evenly across all four weeks to balance epidemic control and mobility. This avoids sudden surges in imported infections and allows consistent monitoring. Trade-offs involve maintaining steady mobility while preventing spikes in imported cases. The fractions sum exactly to 1, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant."

    "notes": "New Mexico shows a lower infected number (I=3080) with a moderate exposed population (E=14303), indicating potential upcoming cases. The formula imported_infected ~ Flow * fraction * (I / population) suggests fewer infections imported. We apply a relaxed-first pattern with slightly higher fractions in weeks 2 and 3 to allow some mobility early while tightening controls in weeks 1 and 4 to prevent importation peaks. This balances epidemic control with economic needs. Trade-offs include slightly stricter controls at start and end to minimize risk during incubation peaks. Fractions sum to 1, keeping flow constant."

    "notes": "Texas has the highest infected population (I=23323) despite a large population (~20.5 million), leading to a higher prevalence risk for importing infections. According to imported_infected ~ Flow * fraction * (I / population), this risk is significant. We adopt a strict-first pattern, starting with low fractions to minimize early importation when Mississippi is vulnerable, then gradually relaxing controls to weeks 3 and 4 as local immunity builds and monitoring improves. The trade-off favors epidemic control upfront with gradual mobility restoration. Fractions sum to 1 exactly."

    "notes": "Virginia has a relatively high infected number (I=26109) and exposed group (E=109682), which may increase infection import risk. Using imported_infected ~ Flow * fraction * (I / population), early weeks are allocated higher fractions to allow some mobility but followed by tighter control in week 4. This relaxed-first pattern helps balance economic activity early, then tightens control as monitoring improves and potential secondary waves can be controlled. Trade-offs include accepting some risk early to maintain flow, then reducing it later. Fractions sum to 1 exactly."
  },
  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound allocations balance risk and mobility by adjusting weekly fractions to minimize imported infections while maintaining total flow. High-risk states like Texas have stricter early controls, preventing initial seeding into Mississippi, while lower-risk states have more even or relaxed-first patterns to sustain economic activity. This staggered approach reduces cumulative infections and deaths by minimizing simultaneous high importation from all states. The approach leverages quantitative cooperation logic where weeks with higher local vulnerability have stricter inbound control, allowing later relaxation as local immunity and case detection improve. Sensitivity analysis shows that if prevalence or transmission rates rise, stricter early controls may be required; conversely, lower prevalence allows more even allocations. This adaptive allocation optimizes epidemic control and mobility jointly across states and weeks."
