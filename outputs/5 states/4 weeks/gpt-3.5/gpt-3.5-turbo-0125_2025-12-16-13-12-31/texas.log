Given the high average daily inbound flow (48046.05), the expected imported infections can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/population), where population = S+E+I+Q+R+D. The infection pressure from Arizona remains relatively stable over time, with no strong indication of increasing or decreasing trends in infection prevalence. Thus, an even traffic allocation pattern is chosen to balance epidemic control and mobility, avoiding sudden spikes in imported cases while maintaining consistent mobility. This approach reduces the risk of large outbreaks while allowing steady economic activity. The fractions sum exactly to 1.0000, ensuring the total inbound flow over 4 weeks remains constant."

Given the slightly elevated E and I values, we adopt a strict-first pattern, with stricter control in weeks 3 and 4 (lower fractions) to reduce cumulative imported infections over time as local outbreaks may intensify.

The imported infected count can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/population), indicating that earlier weeks with lower fractions reduce immediate risk. Because Arizona's infected population is moderate but exposed population is large, a strict-first pattern is selected to reduce early importation of cases and allow time for local Texas containment. This balances epidemic control by frontloading restrictions, while progressively relaxing flows to support mobility later. The fractions sum exactly to 1, validating distribution."

The risk of importing infected individuals is significant. Given this, a strict-first pattern is chosen to reduce transmission risk upfront.

A strict-first pattern with very low initial fractions is chosen to strongly limit early imported cases and allow Texas to manage existing cases. The flow is relaxed in later weeks as local immunity and containment may improve. Balancing epidemic control and mobility, this approach mitigates risk spikes while permitting gradual reopening. The fractions sum exactly to 1."

  "global_guidance": "Across all origin states, the strategy prioritizes reducing early week inbound flow from states with higher infection pressures (Virginia, Mississippi, Arizona) using a strict-first pattern to minimize initial imported infections and deaths in Texas. New Mexico, with lower infection prevalence, follows an even pattern allowing stable mobility. This coordinated temporal distribution reduces peak imported cases, enabling Texas to better control local transmission and healthcare capacity. Quantitatively, balancing weekly fractions so that Flow*ft*(I/population) is minimized early reduces seeding events. Sensitivity to changes in prevalence or beta shows that stricter early controls are robust in preventing outbreaks, while relaxing flows later supports economic activity. This policy optimally leverages inter-state cooperation and temporal modulation of inbound traffic to minimize cumulative COVID-19 impact in Texas."

    "notes": "Arizona shows moderate infection prevalence (I=9108) relative to its population (~8.5M susceptible) and a significant exposed count (E=142607), indicating ongoing transmission. The imported infected estimate is approximately proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population). Given a large inflow and moderate infection risk, an even distribution (even pattern) of traffic control balances mobility and infection risk, avoiding spikes in any week that could stress control measures. This approach ensures consistent risk management over 4 weeks without abrupt loosening or tightening, allowing adaptation to evolving local conditions. The fractions sum exactly to 1, ensuring total flow remains constant."

  "mississippi": {
    "fractions": [0.35, 0.30, 0.20, 0.15],
    "notes": "Mississippi has a relatively high exposed fraction (E=35365) and infected (I=13345) against a smaller population (~0.38M susceptible), indicating higher infection prevalence pressure. To minimize importation of infections, stricter controls are applied in later weeks (strict-first pattern) reducing flow gradually (from 0.35 down to 0.15), anticipating possible epidemic peaks. This front-loading of mobility allows essential movement early but limits risk accumulation. Trade-off balances economic and social needs early with increasing control to prevent spread. Fractions sum to 1 exactly, maintaining constant total inbound flow."

    "notes": "New Mexico has a low infected count (I=3080) and moderate exposed (E=14303) relative to its population (~8.7M susceptible), indicating lower transmission risk. Thus, a relaxed-first pattern is chosen, starting with stricter control (0.15) and gradually relaxing to 0.35 in week 4, allowing increased mobility as risk is low. This phased approach supports economic activity while mitigating initial importation risk. Quantitatively, this reduces early imported infections when local prevalence is uncertain. The fractions sum to 1 exactly, preserving total flow."

  "virginia": {

    "notes": "Virginia exhibits a relatively high infected count (I=26109) and exposed (E=109682) in a population of ~7.6M susceptible, indicating a moderate-high infection risk. An intermediate pattern with slightly increasing flow in weeks 2 and 3, then moderate reduction in week 4 balances continuing mobility needs and infection control. This mitigates importation risk by avoiding high flow early when infections are significant, leveraging some relaxation mid-period to support movement while anticipating control adjustments. Fractions sum exactly to 1, maintaining total inbound flow."
  },
  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocation collectively balances imported infection risks across states by adjusting weekly flow fractions based on each origin's infection prevalence (I/population) and exposed counts (E). States with higher infection pressure (mississippi, virginia) receive stricter controls earlier or mid-period to suppress importation risks, while lower-risk states (new mexico) have relaxed controls later to support mobility. Arizona's moderate risk justifies even control. This distribution reduces the cumulative expected imported infections as imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), thereby minimizing further spread and deaths in Texas. The constant total flow per state respects economic and social demands, avoiding sudden mobility shocks. Sensitivity analysis suggests if beta or prevalence rises, stricter front-loading controls would be needed to prevent surges. Conversely, lower transmission rates could allow more relaxed patterns. This coordinated policy optimizes epidemic control and mobility trade-offs, ensuring adaptive, balanced incoming flow management."
