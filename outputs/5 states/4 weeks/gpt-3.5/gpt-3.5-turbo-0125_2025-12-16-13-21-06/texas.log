    "notes": "Arizona shows moderate infectious pressure with I=6029 and E=93969 in a population ~1.36 million. Imported infected cases roughly scale with Flow*ft*(I+E)/pop, so evenly distributing flows avoids clustering risk in any single week. The consistent prevalence suggests no strong surge or decline, so an even pattern balances epidemic control and mobility needs. Total fractions sum to exactly 1.000."

Allocating more flow earlier weeks (strict-first pattern) allows catching and controlling cases early while gradually relaxing controls later.

A slight strict-first approach (more control early, then modest relaxation) reduces peak import risk while permitting some mobility. Imported infections proportionate to Flow*ft*(I+E)/pop; front-loading stricter controls mitigates cumulative importation. The fractions sum to 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the recommended allocations balance risk across origin states and weeks by modulating weekly inbound flows per their epidemic pressures. States with rising or high infection prevalence (Mississippi, Virginia) have stricter controls initially to curb early importation, while states with declining risk (New Mexico) allow gradual relaxation. Arizona's stable prevalence supports even flow distribution. This cooperative strategy minimizes cumulative imported infections and subsequent deaths by smoothing importation risk and avoiding peaks. Sensitivity to prevalence and transmission rate beta suggests that if infections surge or beta increases, stricter early controls should be intensified. Conversely, if prevalence falls or beta decreases, controls can relax sooner to restore mobility. Allocations maintain total inbound flows, ensuring travel demand is met while prioritizing epidemic control."

    "notes": "Arizona has a large population with a moderate infected population (I=8951) relative to its size (approx. 9M). The imported infected roughly scale as Flow*ft*(I/population). Given the moderate infection pressure and large inflow, a gradual relaxation pattern (strict-first) is chosen to initially limit imported infections while allowing some easing later. Week 1 is strictest (0.20) to reduce early import risk, increasing in weeks 2 and 3 (0.25, 0.30), then slightly relaxing again in week 4 (0.25). This pattern balances epidemic control by front-loading restrictions while maintaining overall flow constant. Sum of fractions is exactly 1.000."

    "notes": "Mississippi has a smaller population with a relatively high exposed (E=31911) and infected (I=11821) proportion compared to population (~0.5 million susceptible). This elevates risk of imported infections. Hence a strict-first pattern is applied, with reduced flow in weeks 3 and 4 (0.20 each) to limit sustained importations. Weeks 1 and 2 have higher fractions (0.30 each) to allow some mobility initially but progressively tighten control. This front-loaded approach mitigates risk whilst preserving total flow. Fractions sum to 1.000."

    "notes": "New Mexico has a large susceptible population and relatively low infected (I=3148) compared to others, indicating lower current epidemic pressure but moderate exposed (E=14714). Therefore, a mildly strict-first pattern is chosen, with slightly lower flow in week 4 (0.20) to cautiously reduce risk as epidemic dynamics may evolve. The middle weeks are slightly relaxed (0.30 in week 2) to balance mobility. This pattern helps minimize infection importation while maintaining mobility. Fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

    "fractions": [0.15, 0.20, 0.30, 0.35],
    "notes": "Virginia exhibits high infected (I=25971) and exposed (E=109283) counts with a large population. This indicates elevated risk of infectious imports. The relaxed-first pattern is used here, ramping up flow gradually from strict week 1 (0.15) to more relaxed week 4 (0.35) to control early importation risk while responding to potential epidemic reductions over time. This pattern balances epidemic control and mobility, especially given the sizable inflow. Fractions sum to exactly 1.000."
  },
  "global_guidance": "The collective allocation balances epidemic risk and mobility by modulating weekly flow fractions based on each origin state's infection prevalence and inflow magnitude. States with higher infected or exposed proportions like Virginia and Mississippi receive stricter initial control (lower fractions in early weeks) to curb early importation, while states with lower infection pressure receive moderately relaxed control. This staggered approach prevents simultaneous high inflow from all states, lowering cumulative imported infections and deaths in Texas. The total inbound flows are preserved, respecting mobility demands. If prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early reductions become more critical to prevent exponential importation. Conversely, lower beta or prevalence would allow more relaxed patterns. This cooperative risk balancing across states and weeks optimizes epidemic control while sustaining necessary mobility."
