    "notes": "Arizona shows a moderately high infected (I=6029) and exposed (E=93969) population relative to its total, indicating significant infection pressure. Imported infections can be approximated by Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)) which is substantial given Arizona's large population and inflow (28008.81 daily). To minimize import risk, we adopt a strict-first pattern, allocating lower fractions in the initial weeks (0.3, 0.3) to reduce early introductions when local prevalence is still notable, then relaxing slightly (0.2, 0.2) as epidemic conditions may improve or local measures strengthen. This balances epidemic control by front-loading restrictions to curb early imported infections, while allowing some mobility later. The fractions sum to 1 exactly (0.3+0.3+0.2+0.2=1)."

    "notes": "Mississippi has a relatively high exposed (E=19232) and infected (I=6983) proportion despite smaller population size (around 160k total population). However, inbound flow is quite low (1016.95 daily). Given lower absolute inflow and to maintain fairness with moderate risk, an even distribution of fractions (0.25 each) is selected to maintain stable, consistent control. Imported infected cases roughly scale with Flow*ft*(I/population), so steady control balances risk without overly restricting mobility. This pattern helps avoid spikes in imported infections while allowing reasonable movement. Fractions sum exactly to 1."

  "texas": {
    "fractions": [0.15, 0.25, 0.3, 0.3],
    "notes": "Texas has the largest population and highest inflow (146639.33 daily) with substantial exposed (E=12452) and infected (I=20806) numbers. Given the large volume of travelers, early weeks should be stricter to reduce initial imported infections when local epidemic in New Mexico can be exacerbated. Hence, a relaxed-first pattern is avoided. Instead, we apply a strict-first pattern with low fraction initially (0.15), gradually relaxing to 0.3 in later weeks, mitigating early import risks while allowing increased mobility as conditions stabilize. This balances epidemic control and mobility demands. Fractions sum exactly to 1."

    "notes": "Virginia has moderate infected (I=20324) and exposed (E=85946) counts and low inflow (1472.9 daily). Similar to Arizona, a strict-first pattern is chosen to reduce initial imported infections when New Mexico's local epidemic is still sensitive. Initial weeks have higher restrictions (fractions 0.3, 0.3) tapering to 0.2, 0.2 later. This pattern balances epidemic control and mobility, preventing early spikes and allowing gradual relaxation. Fractions sum exactly to 1."
  },
  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations collectively prioritize reducing imported infections during the early weeks when New Mexico's local epidemic is vulnerable. States with large infected populations and high inflows (Texas, Arizona) are assigned stricter early restrictions (low fractions initially) to minimize the risk of seeding new cases. Smaller inflow states with moderate risk (Mississippi, Virginia) have either even or moderately strict patterns to balance control and mobility. This cross-state coordination reduces cumulative imported infection pressure and deaths by minimizing early importation when local control is most effective. The quantitative cooperation logic balances risk over weeks, allowing gradual relaxation as local and imported risks reduce, maintaining overall traffic volume constant to preserve economic and social needs. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence (I/E) or transmission rate beta rises, stricter early week fractions would be even more critical to prevent exponential growth. Conversely, if prevalence falls or beta decreases, fractions could be more relaxed earlier. This adaptive policy framework is robust to such variations, dynamically balancing epidemic control and mobility."

The expected imported infections can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population), so earlier weeks with stricter control (lower ft) reduce initial importation risk. We adopt a strict-first pattern, allocating lower fractions early (week 4 being most relaxed) to minimize early seeding of infections in New Mexico.

The imported infected cases are Flow * ft * (I/population), so reducing early week inflow has significant effects.

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy prioritizes stricter inbound traffic control in early weeks from states with higher infection prevalence (mississippi, arizona, texas) to reduce initial importation risk and delay epidemic growth in New Mexico. This staged relaxation aligns with expected improvements in local epidemic conditions and immunity accrual. Balancing traffic control across states and weeks reduces the cumulative imported infections and deaths by minimizing simultaneous high-risk inflows. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta rises, stricter early controls become more critical. Conversely, if these parameters decrease, traffic can be more evenly allocated.
