    "notes": "Arizona has a large susceptible population but moderate exposed and infected levels. The imported infections roughly scale as Flow*ft*(I/population), indicating that controlling inflow early minimizes risk of importation during peak infectiousness. The chosen pattern is strict-first, reducing traffic in weeks 1 and 2 to limit early importation and allowing gradual relaxation later as local controls improve. This balances epidemic control with mobility by smoothing demand over weeks while prioritizing early containment. Fractions sum to exactly 1."

    "notes": "Texas has the highest infected and exposed counts, posing significant importation risk. The strict-first pattern with frontloaded traffic reduction lowers imported infections early, crucial to prevent seeding new cases in Virginia. Imported infections scale as Flow*ft*(I/population). The decreasing fractions reflect stronger controls early, relaxing as local epidemic situation potentially stabilizes. Fractions add up to 1 exactly."
  },
  "global_guidance": "The overall policy emphasizes strict traffic controls in the initial weeks for higher-risk origin states (Texas, Arizona, Mississippi) to minimize imported infections when Virginia's susceptible population is still vulnerable. Lower-risk states like New Mexico maintain even traffic to balance control and mobility. This cross-state coordination reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths by frontloading restrictions when epidemic pressure is highest, allowing gradual reopening. The quantitative cooperation logic ensures total inbound flows remain constant but are temporally reallocated to optimize epidemic outcomes. Sensitivity analysis shows that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become even more critical, while lower prevalence or beta allows more even or relaxed allocations. This strategy balances epidemic control and mobility sustainability across states and weeks."

    "notes": "Arizona has a large susceptible population (8.27 million) and moderate exposed (140k) and infected (9k) counts. The infected proportion relative to population is low (~0.001). Imported infected can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / total population). Because infection levels are stable and not increasing sharply, we use an even pattern for traffic control to balance epidemic control and mobility needs. This avoids sudden spikes or drops in travel that could destabilize local epidemic dynamics. The fractions sum exactly to 1.0, maintaining total inbound flow while evenly distributing risk."

    "notes": "Mississippi shows relatively high exposed (31.9k) and infected (11.8k) counts relative to its smaller population (432k susceptible), indicating higher infection pressure. This suggests higher risk of imported cases early on. Therefore, a strict-first pattern with decreasing fractions over 4 weeks is used to strongly reduce early inbound flow and limit initial importation, then gradually relax controls. The imported infected is roughly Flow * ft * (I/population). The trade-off is stricter early controls may impact mobility but reduce peak infections. Fractions sum to 1.0 exactly."

    "notes": "New Mexico has relatively low infected (3.1k) and exposed (14.7k) counts compared to a large susceptible population (~9.4 million), indicating lower risk. Hence, a relaxed-first pattern is adopted, allowing slightly more flow in later weeks as risk is low and mobility benefits increase. Imported infections are proportional to Flow * ft * (I/population). This balances epidemic control with economic mobility, with fractions summing exactly to 1.0."

    "notes": "Texas has high infected (20.9k) and moderate exposed (12.7k) counts with a large population (~19.7 million susceptible). Infection pressure is moderate but stable. A slightly strict-first to even pattern is chosen to initially restrict flow and then moderately relax it, balancing infection control and economic activity. Imported infected is approximated by Flow * ft * (I/population). Fractions sum to 1.0 exactly, ensuring flow totals remain constant."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound flow controls across states aim to minimize imported infections into Virginia by adjusting weekly fractions based on origin state infection prevalence and population size. States with higher infection pressure (e.g., Mississippi) have stricter early week controls to reduce immediate risk, while lower risk states (e.g., New Mexico) have relaxed early controls. This coordination balances epidemic risk reduction with maintaining mobility and economic activity. The total inbound flow over 4 weeks per state remains constant, ensuring fairness and predictability. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection rates or transmission (beta) increase, stricter or more prolonged traffic controls may be necessary to curb imported infections. Conversely, lower prevalence or transmission supports more relaxed flow schedules. This strategy leverages temporal modulation of inbound flows to flatten imported infection peaks and reduce cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia."
