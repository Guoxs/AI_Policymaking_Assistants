    "notes": "Mississippi has a relatively high proportion of infectious individuals (I=6983) compared to its population (6.6 million), indicating a moderate infection risk. Imported infections are roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population). Given the risk, a strict-first pattern is chosen, with stronger restrictions early on (f1=0.40) to quickly reduce imported infections when local Arizona prevalence is still significant. The gradually relaxed traffic control over weeks balances epidemic control and mobility, avoiding sudden surges later. The fractions sum to exactly 1, ensuring the total 4-week inbound volume remains constant."

Imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/population). Given stable low prevalence and significant flow, an even pattern avoids unnecessary strict controls that may impact mobility. Even distribution maintains steady, manageable risk without surges. This approach balances epidemic control with preserving mobility and economic activity. Fractions sum to 1 exactly."

A strict-first pattern is justified to curb infections early, leveraging stronger restrictions (f1=0.35) and gradually relaxing as local dynamics improve. This reduces cumulative cases and deaths in Arizona. The trade-off accepts some short-term mobility loss for long-term epidemic gain. The fractions sum to 1 exactly."

A relaxed-first pattern is chosen to allow some flow early (f1=0.20) increasing in mid-weeks, anticipating improved surveillance and control. This pattern balances mobility and epidemic risk considering Virginia's moderate prevalence. The fractions sum precisely to 1."

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy distributes inbound flow fractions to minimize cumulative infections in Arizona by front-loading strict controls on states with higher prevalence and flow (Texas, Mississippi) to reduce early importation pressure. States with lower prevalence or flow (New Mexico, Virginia) have more balanced or relaxed patterns to preserve mobility. Quantitatively, imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/population), so adjusting ft by week and origin balances risk over 4 weeks without changing total flow. This coordinated approach lowers peak imported infections, reduces deaths, and smooths local epidemic curves. Sensitivity analysis shows that if prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early restrictions would become more critical. Conversely, lower prevalence or successful local interventions would allow more relaxed policies. This adaptive allocation leverages temporal and spatial heterogeneity for effective epidemic control while maintaining essential mobility."

    "notes": "Mississippi has a relatively high infection prevalence with I=11821 and E=31911 among a population of ~6.6M, indicating moderate infection pressure. The expected imported infected cases roughly scale as Flow*ft*(I/population), so shifting inbound flow away from early weeks reduces immediate importation. We select a strict-first pattern with reduced flow in week 3 and 4, as infections might persist longer, but allow moderate flow initially to balance economic needs. The trade-off balances epidemic control by front-loading restrictions and allowing gradual relaxation. The fractions sum to 1 exactly (0.3+0.28+0.22+0.20=1)."

    "notes": "New Mexico shows relatively low infectious prevalence (I=3148, E=14714) in a large population (~9.5M), indicating lower risk per traveler. We use an even distribution (equal fractions) to maintain consistent flow and minimal disruption given the moderate infection risk. The expected imported infections remain balanced weekly, minimizing large spikes in imported infections. This approach supports steady mobility while controlling disease importation risk.

    "notes": "Texas has a higher infected population (I=20900) and moderate exposed (E=12673) in a large population (~20M). The infection pressure is significant, so we implement a relaxed-first policy, starting with lower flow (0.20) and increasing toward week 4 (0.30). This strategy delays higher mobility until infections in Texas potentially decline, reducing early importation risk. The trade-off accepts short-term stricter control for longer-term mobility restoration. The fractions sum to 1 exactly."

    "notes": "Virginia has high exposed (E=109283) and infected (I=25971) relative to population (~7.75M), indicating significant infection pressure. We use a strict-first pattern, heavily restricting inbound flow in later weeks (0.15), as infections may persist or increase. Front-loading flow allocation (0.35, then 0.30) allows some mobility early when imported risk can be managed, then tightens control. This balances epidemic control and economic needs, minimizing deaths and infections in Arizona. Fractions sum to 1 exactly."
  },
  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound flow allocations prioritize reducing imported infections early from states with higher infection pressure (Virginia, Mississippi) by applying stricter controls in later weeks or front-loading restrictions, while allowing more stable or gradually increasing flow from lower risk states (New Mexico, Texas). This temporal distribution lowers the cumulative infection importation into Arizona, flattening peaks and allowing better epidemic control. The cooperation logic balances risk across states and weeks, minimizing overall deaths and confirmed cases by smoothing inflow while respecting total mobility baselines. Sensitivity analysis suggests if prevalence or beta increases, stricter front-loading controls would be needed, especially for high prevalence states. Conversely, lower prevalence allows more even or relaxed distributions without raising importation risk. This adaptive allocation optimally balances public health and mobility in Arizona's context."
