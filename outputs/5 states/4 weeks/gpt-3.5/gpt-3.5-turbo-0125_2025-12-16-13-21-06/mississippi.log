    "notes": "Arizona has a large susceptible population with moderate exposed (E=93969) and low infected (I=6029) relative to population size (~8.7M). The imported infected can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/population) = 1731.81*ft*(6029/8544191), which is low but non-negligible. Given the moderate infection pressure, a strict-first pattern (lower fractions early) is chosen to reduce imported infections early when epidemic growth is sensitive. Relaxing controls later acknowledges lower infection risk and balances mobility needs. Trade-offs include some economic impact early but overall better protection for Mississippi. The fractions sum to exactly 1.0."

    "notes": "New Mexico exhibits low infected (I=1969) and exposed (E=8978) relative to population (~7.6M), implying relatively low infection risk. Expected imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/population) = 1372.38*ft*(1969/7565747), which is small. A strict-first pattern is used to minimize early risk when susceptible Mississippi is vulnerable, gradually easing restrictions. This approach balances epidemic control with maintaining reasonable inbound flow. The fractions add exactly to 1, validating allocation."

We choose a relaxed-first pattern to allow higher flows initially while closely monitoring, then moderately reducing flows to mitigate cumulative risk, reflecting dynamic epidemic progression and economic importance. This pattern balances disease control with mobility. Fractions sum exactly to 1."

The imported infection risk is moderate: Flow*ft*(I/population) = 3518.71*ft*(20324/7900374). An even distribution is chosen here to maintain consistent control and avoid spikes in imported cases, balancing epidemic risk and mobility. This steady approach minimizes abrupt changes in policy and supports stable travel demand. The fractions sum to 1."
  },
  "global_guidance": "The allocation strategy collectively reduces imported infections by implementing stricter controls earlier for states with moderate to low infected proportions (Arizona, New Mexico) and a more relaxed early approach for Texas where economic and mobility needs are higher but balanced by later moderate restrictions. Virginia's even approach stabilizes risk import. Quantitatively, this balances the total inbound flow constant while modulating weekly fractions to reduce early imported infection pressure when Mississippi's susceptible population is large. This cross-state coordination helps prevent overwhelming local healthcare. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls may need to be intensified, particularly from Texas and Virginia. Conversely, if prevalence falls, more relaxed patterns may be justified to support mobility. Overall, this policy carefully balances epidemic control and economic considerations, minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Mississippi."

    "notes": "Arizona shows a moderately high number of exposed (E=140433) and confirmed cases (Q=206953) relative to its population, indicating ongoing transmission risk. The infected count (I=8951) is moderate but significant. Imported infections roughly scale as Flow * ft * (I / population), with population ~8.5M. Given relatively stable infection levels, an even allocation (equal fractions) spreads risk consistently across weeks, avoiding spikes in imported infections. This pattern balances mobility and control without abrupt restrictions that may be hard to enforce. The total fractions sum to exactly 1.0, fulfilling constraints."

    "notes": "New Mexico has lower infected (I=3148) and exposed (E=14714) counts relative to population (~9.4M), implying lower importation risk. However, slight relaxation mid-period (weeks 2 and 3) allows controlled mobility while maintaining stricter control early and late to buffer potential case import spikes. Imported infected risk scales as Flow * ft * (I/population); with lower prevalence, front-loading stricter control mitigates early risk. The pattern is a mild relaxed-first approach, balancing epidemic control and mobility. Fractions sum to 1.0 exactly."

    "notes": "Texas has the highest infected count (I=20900) among origins and a large population (~20M), posing substantial risk for imported infections. The inbound flow is also highest (30566 daily). A strict-first pattern is chosen to minimize early importation by setting a low fraction in week 1 and gradually relaxing controls as epidemic pressures in Texas and Mississippi may evolve. This reduces immediate risk of seeding infections in Mississippi while allowing phased economic activity resumption. The fractions sum to 1.0 exactly, meeting requirements."

An early relaxed approach (weeks 1 and 2) followed by stricter control (weeks 3 and 4) balances initial mobility and later risk reduction, assuming Mississippi's epidemic state may improve or seasonal factors reduce transmissibility. This relaxed-first pattern manages trade-offs between economic needs and health risks. Fractions sum exactly to 1.0."
  },
  "global_guidance": "The traffic allocation across states strategically balances imported infection risk and mobility over four weeks to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Mississippi. States with higher infected prevalence and inflow (Texas, Virginia) receive stricter early controls to reduce initial seeding, while states with lower prevalence (New Mexico) allow slightly relaxed mid-period inflow to support mobility. Arizona's moderate risk is managed with even distribution to avoid spikes. This coordinated approach leverages temporal control variation to smooth demand on healthcare and reduce outbreak surges. Sensitivity to beta and prevalence implies that increases in transmission rates or undetected infections would warrant stricter early controls and even lower fractions for high-risk origins. Conversely, improvements in source states' epidemic status could allow more relaxed traffic patterns. Overall, the policy reflects risk-weighted flow modulation, preserving total inflow but optimizing timing to reduce epidemic impact."
