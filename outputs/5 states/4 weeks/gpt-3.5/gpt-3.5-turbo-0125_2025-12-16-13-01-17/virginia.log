    "notes": "Mississippi has a relatively high infected ratio (I=5689) compared to a small population (~400k), indicating high prevalence and risk. The exposed fraction (E=16001) is also significant. Imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/Population); thus, a strict-first policy with strong early reductions is warranted to minimize initial imported infection seeding in Virginia. This reduces risk of outbreaks and deaths early on. Mobility is relaxed progressively to balance economic needs. Fractions total 1.0 exactly."

    "notes": "New Mexico has low infected (I=1928) and exposed (E=8934) counts relative to its population (~8.3 million), implying lower risk. A relaxed-first pattern is selected, allowing slightly higher flow initially to support mobility, with some tightening in later weeks to prevent delayed surges. The imported infection risk is lower, so this pattern balances epidemic control with mobility needs without strongly restricting early traffic. Fractions sum to 1.0."

    "notes": "Texas shows a moderate infected count (I=17312) over a large population (~21.8 million), and moderate exposed (E=10456). Given its large absolute inflow to Virginia, an even pattern is chosen to maintain consistent control measures over time, preventing spikes in imported infections while balancing mobility. This approach stabilizes risk and supports economic activity. Fractions sum exactly to 1.0."
  },
  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocation across all origin states balances epidemic risk and mobility by considering the relative infected and exposed fractions and population sizes. States with higher infection prevalence and smaller populations (e.g., Mississippi) receive stricter early reductions (strict-first pattern) to minimize early seeding of infections in Virginia, while states with lower prevalence (e.g., New Mexico) are allowed more relaxed early flow. Texas with large flow but moderate risk uses even allocations to maintain steady control. This coordinated approach minimizes cumulative infections and deaths by flattening imported infection peaks and allowing gradual adaptation. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or beta increases, stricter early controls would further reduce importation. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed policies could be safely adopted. Cross-state coordination ensures that imported infections are spread out over time to avoid overwhelming local epidemic control capacities."
