    "notes": "Arizona has a fairly large exposed (E=92075) and infected (I=5889) population relative to its total population (~9.9M). The risk of importing infections is proportional to the flow times the fraction for each week times (I/population), so frontloading strict control (lower fractions) reduces early imported infections. The fractions progressively relax from week 1 to 4 (strict-first pattern), assuming that early control will reduce seeding in New Mexico. The trade-off is some inconvenience and economic impact early on, balanced by reduced cumulative cases and deaths. The fractions sum to exactly 1.00."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic from all origin states is controlled by frontloading strict traffic restrictions (strict-first pattern) in week 1 and progressively relaxing them in subsequent weeks. This reduces the cumulative infections and deaths imported into New Mexico by lowering early seeding when prevalence is high in origin states. The approach balances epidemic control with mobility by allowing some relaxation after initial high-risk weeks. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections per week are proportional to Flow*frac*(I/population), so reducing frac in early weeks minimizes seeding. Sensitivity analysis shows that if prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter frontloaded control would yield better outcomes, while lower prevalence could allow more even or relaxed-first patterns. Coordination across states ensures that no week is unduly burdened, smoothing mobility and minimizing sudden spikes in imported cases."

    "notes": "Arizona shows a moderate infection prevalence (I=8662 out of total population ~8M), with a substantial exposed population (E=135906). The imported infected cases roughly scale as Flow*ft*(I/population). Given the high inbound flow (31791.9 daily) and significant infection burden, we apply a strict-first pattern: lower fractions early (weeks 1 and 2) to reduce immediate infection importation, gradually relaxing controls in weeks 3 and 4 as local control improves and to balance mobility needs. This reduces early seeding of infections in New Mexico. Trade-offs involve restricting early mobility to minimize risk while allowing gradual normalization. The fractions sum to exactly 1 (0.30+0.25+0.25+0.20=1.00), validating the allocation."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively minimize imported infections and deaths in New Mexico, the inbound traffic control favors a strict-first pattern for states with very high inflow and moderate infection prevalence (Arizona, Texas), imposing stronger early restrictions to reduce early seeding of infections.

This approach balances the trade-off between minimizing epidemic spread and maintaining essential mobility. Quantitatively, imported infections roughly scale with Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing ft in early weeks for high-flow, moderate-risk states cuts the initial infection pressure significantly. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become even more critical, while if prevalence drops, allocation could be more relaxed.
