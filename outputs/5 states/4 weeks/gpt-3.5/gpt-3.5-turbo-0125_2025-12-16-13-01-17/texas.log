    "fractions": [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25],
    "notes": "Arizona has a large susceptible population (8.7M) and a moderate infected count (I=5889). The imported infections roughly scale with Flow*ft*(I/Population). With Flow around 44K daily, spreading traffic evenly (0.25 each week) avoids peaks that could cause spikes in imported cases. This even pattern balances mobility and epidemic control given steady infection prevalence. Tightening traffic unevenly would concentrate risk or overly restrict mobility without clear benefit. The fractions sum exactly to 1, meeting constraints."

    "fractions": [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1],
    "notes": "Mississippi has smaller population but relatively high infection prevalence (I=5689 out of ~400K total). Infection pressure is higher, so front-loading restrictions reduces early importation risk. Imported infections ~ Flow*ft*(I/Pop). Weekly fractions decrease from 0.4 to 0.1, a strict-first pattern, to suppress early seeding of cases into Texas. This reduces cumulative infections and deaths despite some mobility loss early on. Fractions sum to 1 exactly."

    "notes": "New Mexico has a large population (8.3M) but low infected count (1928), indicating lower infection pressure. Imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/Pop). A relaxed-first pattern is chosen, allowing more flow later weeks when local Texas controls and vaccinations may mitigate risk. Early weeks have lower fractions to intercept initial risk. This pattern balances control and mobility to optimize outcomes. Fractions sum exactly to 1."

    "fractions": [0.3, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2],
    "notes": "Virginia has a sizeable infected population (19610) and high exposed (82982) indicating a rising epidemic. Importing infections ~ Flow*ft*(I/Pop). A moderate approach with slightly more relaxed early weeks (0.3,0.3) and stricter later weeks (0.2,0.2) balances mobility and epidemic control anticipating possible changes in prevalence. This pattern prevents sharp infection import spikes while maintaining flow. Fractions sum exactly to 1."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocation across origin states balances epidemic risk and mobility by smoothing importation of infections over the 4 weeks. States with higher infection prevalence and smaller populations (mississippi) are assigned strict-first patterns to reduce early seeding risk in Texas, which is critical to minimize cumulative cases and deaths given Texas's moderate infection burden. States with lower prevalence or larger populations (arizona, new mexico) have more even or relaxed-first patterns allowing mobility but controlling importation risk progressively. Virginias moderate strictness with front-loaded flow balances its rising infection trends. This coordinated approach reduces peak imported infections, enabling Texas to manage epidemic growth more effectively. Sensitivity to prevalence and transmission rate beta is accounted for by front-loading restrictions on higher risk states and smoothing flow. If prevalence or beta increase, stricter early week controls would further reduce risk. Conversely, if prevalence drops, relaxed schedules could be adopted to enhance mobility without compromising safety."

  "arizona": {
    "fractions": [0.30, 0.25, 0.25, 0.20],
    "notes": "Arizona has a large susceptible population but also a relatively high exposed count (135,906) and moderate infected (8,662). Using the formula imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), higher infected prevalence suggests more risk early on. Therefore, we adopt a strict-first pattern with lower traffic in weeks 1 and 2 and slightly relaxed in weeks 3 and 4 to reduce initial importation risk. This balances epidemic control by front-loading restrictions while allowing some mobility later. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000, ensuring total inflow remains constant."

  "mississippi": {
    "fractions": [0.35, 0.30, 0.20, 0.15],
    "notes": "Mississippi has a smaller population but high exposed (18,044) and infected (6,527) relative to its size, indicating considerable risk. To mitigate, a strict-first approach is chosen to reduce importation early. The imported infected risk roughly follows Flow*ft*(I/population), so frontloading stricter controls reduces early seeding. Mobility is eased gradually to balance travel needs. Total fractions sum to 1.000, maintaining total flow over 4 weeks."

    "notes": "New Mexico shows lower infected prevalence (3,041) relative to population and moderate exposed (14,378). This suggests relatively lower immediate risk from imported infections. Hence, an even distribution of traffic is adopted, balancing epidemic control and mobility evenly across the 4 weeks. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000."

  "virginia": {
    "fractions": [0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.25],
    "notes": "Virginia has a high number of infected (25,112) and exposed (105,777), indicating substantial risk of imported infections. However, since the infected number is high but mobility baseline is lower, we choose a relaxed-first pattern, with slightly increased flow in weeks 3 and 4 after some initial controls to allow mobility while monitoring infections. This pattern helps balance economic needs and epidemic control. Fractions sum exactly to 1.000."
  },
  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocations prioritize stricter controls in initial weeks for states with higher infected and exposed prevalence (Arizona, Mississippi, Virginia) to reduce early imported infections and thus slow local transmission in Texas. New Mexico, with lower infected prevalence, maintains even traffic to sustain necessary mobility. Balancing weekly fractions allows Texas to keep total 4-week inflow constant per origin state while minimizing cumulative cases and deaths by delaying and reducing peak imported infections. This cooperative strategy across states distributes risk temporally and geographically, reducing simultaneous high-risk inflows. Sensitivity analysis suggests if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter initial controls should be further intensified. Conversely, lower prevalence or improved testing could allow more relaxed flows. This dynamic and data-driven approach optimizes epidemic control without unduly hampering mobility."
