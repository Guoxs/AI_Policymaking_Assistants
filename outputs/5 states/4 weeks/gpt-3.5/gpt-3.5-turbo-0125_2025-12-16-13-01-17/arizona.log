The risk of importing infections is proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), so steady weekly allocation is reasonable. The I/pop ratio is moderate, and no strong trends suggest early or late peak. Even distribution balances epidemic control and mobility, avoiding sudden influx spikes. The fractions sum to exactly 1, ensuring the total 4-week inbound flow remains unchanged."

Allocating more flow in the first two weeks (30% each) allows some relaxation early when the disease pressure is stable, then tighter control later (20%, 20%) anticipating possible changes. This relaxed-first pattern leverages New Mexico's lower infection prevalence while mitigating risk in later weeks. The fractions sum to 1 exactly."

Due to high infection pressure, stricter control is needed early to minimize imported infections: imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/pop). The pattern is strict-first with increasing fractions over weeks (0.15 to 0.35), corresponding to ramping up mobility as local conditions improve or as Arizona's control strengthens. This reduces early seeding risk while balancing mobility later. The fractions sum exactly to 1."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the allocations prioritize stricter early controls for states with higher infection prevalence (Texas, Virginia) to reduce imported infections and subsequent deaths in Arizona, while states with lower prevalence (New Mexico, Mississippi) have more even or relaxed-first patterns. This staggered approach balances epidemic control across weeks and origins, minimizing peak imported infections when Arizona's local epidemic is more vulnerable. The total inbound flow per state is conserved by adjusting weekly fractions, ensuring no reduction in overall mobility volume but redistributing it to manage risk. The strategy is sensitive to prevalence and transmission rate beta; higher beta or rising infections would warrant stricter early controls. If prevalence in any origin changes, the fractions should be recalibrated to maintain minimal cumulative infections and deaths in Arizona."

    "notes": "Mississippi has a moderately high infected (I=6527) and exposed (E=18044) population relative to its size (population sum approx 741,284). The risk of importing infections is proportional to the inbound flow times fraction times infected proportion (imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population)). Since the inflow is relatively low (2159.29 daily) and infection pressure is moderate, an even distribution (even pattern) of traffic control fractions over the 4 weeks is chosen to balance epidemic control and mobility. Strict front-loading or relaxation is not justified by significant infection trend changes. This approach spreads risk evenly and maintains mobility, minimizing sudden spikes. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.25*4=1)."

The inbound flow is large (33853.05 daily), increasing potential imported infections, proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population). Given a slightly decreasing infection pressure trend, a strict-first pattern is used with more traffic early (0.35,0.30) and stricter control later (0.20,0.15). This reduces risk of imported infections in later weeks where Arizona's own infection burden is high, mitigating cumulative cases and deaths. The trade-off balances economic activity early and epidemic control later. Fractions sum to 1 exactly (0.35+0.30+0.20+0.15=1)."

The inbound flow is very high (53063.29 daily), so imported infections are significant. Here, a relaxed-first pattern (increasing fractions over time) is chosen: starting strict (0.15) and gradually relaxing to 0.35. This protects Arizona from high imported infections initially when local infections are already substantial, allowing time for local control to reduce risk. Later weeks relax restrictions as prevalence possibly declines. Trade-offs favor initial epidemic control with later mobility recovery. Fractions sum to 1 exactly (0.15+0.20+0.30+0.35=1)."

    "notes": "Virginia has moderate infected (I=25112) and high exposed (E=105777) populations with about 7.7 million population. Its inflow to Arizona is lower (5548.43 daily) but infection risk remains non-negligible. An even pattern is chosen to balance consistent moderate controls and mobility, as no clear infection trend shift justifies heavier front or back loading. This balances risk equally over 4 weeks, preventing spikes and allowing steady mobility. The fractions sum to 1 exactly (0.25*4=1)."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocations collectively reduce expected imported infections and deaths in Arizona by balancing infection risks from origin states with different epidemic burdens and flow volumes. States with high infected populations and large flows (Texas) receive stricter initial controls (low early fractions), reducing imported infections when Arizona's local burden is high. States with lower infection prevalence (New Mexico) use a strict-first pattern to protect later weeks when cumulative risk matters. Moderate risk states (Mississippi, Virginia) use even distributions to maintain steady control and mobility. This cross-state coordination balances imported risk over time, avoiding synchronized peaks in imported infections. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls should be prioritized to prevent overwhelming Arizona's healthcare system. Conversely, if prevalence declines, more relaxed late controls can be safely applied. The approach is robust to moderate parameter variations, ensuring that traffic control policies adapt to dynamic epidemic conditions and reduce cumulative confirmed cases and deaths efficiently."
