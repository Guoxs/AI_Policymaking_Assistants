  "global_guidance": "The allocation strategy prioritizes reducing early imported infections from high-risk states such as Texas and Arizona by enforcing stricter controls in earlier weeks and relaxing later. New Mexico and Virginia, with lower or moderate infection pressure and smaller inflow, have even distributions to avoid unnecessary mobility restrictions that could impact economic and social factors. This cross-state balancing reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths in Mississippi by smoothing inflows and avoiding spikes in imported cases. The approach is sensitive to changes in prevalence and transmission rates; if prevalence or beta increases, stricter early controls would be more beneficial. Conversely, if infection rates decline, a more relaxed pattern could be adopted earlier to restore mobility. Overall, the strategy balances epidemic control with mobility needs, leveraging temporal staggering of inbound flows to minimize cumulative disease burden."

    "notes": "Arizona has a large susceptible population with a relatively low infected population (I=8662 out of ~8 million), but a high exposed count (E=135906) indicating potential for rising infections. Imported infected cases roughly estimated as Flow*ft*(I/Population) suggest that strict early control can reduce initial importation pressure. Due to the increasing exposed individuals, a strict-first pattern is chosen to frontload restrictions in weeks 1 and 2, gradually relaxing later as risks potentially stabilize. This balances epidemic control and mobility by limiting early-week importation while allowing some economic activity later. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.30+0.25+0.25+0.20=1.00)."

The infected proportion is low, but exposed cases suggest a potential rise. The imported infected can be estimated by Flow*ft*(I/Population). We apply a strict-first pattern to reduce early importation risks, with slightly more relaxed weeks 2 and 3 to balance economic activity and monitoring.

The imported infected cases estimated by Flow*ft*(I/Population) suggest higher risk if inflows are unrestricted. We adopt a strict-first approach with the lowest fraction in week 1 (0.15) to reduce early importation, then gradually relax controls over weeks 2 to 4, allowing increased mobility as surveillance improves and local interventions take effect.

    "notes": "Virginia has a relatively high infected count (I=25112) but also a very large susceptible and recovered population. The high exposed value (E=105777) indicates a risk of spreading infections. However, to balance the economic mobility and epidemic control, we use an even distribution (even pattern) of traffic control fractions. This evenly spreads the importation risk and allows consistent monitoring and adjustment over all four weeks. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.25+0.25+0.25+0.25=1.00)."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic control allocations collectively aim to minimize cumulative infections and deaths in Mississippi by strategically adjusting weekly traffic flows based on the origin states' infection pressures. States with higher exposed and infected populations (Arizona, Texas, Virginia) have stricter controls frontloaded to reduce early importation of infections, while states with lower infection prevalence (New Mexico) have a slightly more relaxed mid-period to sustain mobility. This balancing act reduces the immediate risk of imported infections that contribute to local outbreaks, while allowing gradual relaxation to maintain economic activity. Quantitatively, the traffic fractions multiply the daily inflow and the infected proportion to estimate imported infections, guiding stricter control when importation risk is higher. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become even more crucial. Cooperation across states by staggering restrictions over weeks reduces simultaneous importation surges, enhancing epidemic control in Mississippi. The fractions for each state sum precisely to 1, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant while enabling temporal modulation of risk."
