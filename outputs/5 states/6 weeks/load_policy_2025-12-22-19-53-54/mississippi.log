This balances risk across weeks and states, minimizing early seeding events which could cause exponential growth. By maintaining total inflow per state, this approach respects mobility needs while prioritizing epidemic control. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early restrictions become even more critical. Conversely, lower prevalence or beta would allow more relaxed distributions. This coordinated policy leverages temporal modulation of inbound traffic to flatten imported infection curves and reduce cumulative cases and deaths.'

Texas, with its large inflow and moderate infection pressure, employs an even distribution to avoid sudden surges in imported infections while maintaining economic activity. This cross-state balancing reduces the overall risk by smoothing imported infections over time and across sources, preventing healthcare overload. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or beta increases, stricter early controls become even more critical, especially for high inflow states. If prevalence declines, controls can be relaxed earlier. This dynamic allocation supports adaptive, data-driven epidemic control while preserving necessary mobility.'

States with lower infection pressure or inflow (New Mexico, Virginia) have more even or slightly relaxed early-week allocations. This cross-state coordination balances total inflow across 6 weeks while minimizing cumulative imported infections and deaths by shifting traffic away from high-risk weeks and states. Sensitivity analysis shows that if transmission rate beta increases or infected prevalence changes, stricter early controls would become more critical. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more even or relaxed allocations may be optimal. This dynamic allocation approach provides flexibility to adapt to changing epidemic conditions while maintaining constant total inflow per state, thus preserving overall mobility demands."
