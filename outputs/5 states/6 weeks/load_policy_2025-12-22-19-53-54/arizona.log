Texas, with lower infection rates, has a more balanced allocation to sustain mobility. This cross-state strategy balances epidemic control and economic activity by shifting inbound traffic to later weeks when infection pressure may decrease or when Arizona's own epidemic status may be more manageable. Quantitatively, we balance the sum of Flow * ft * (I/population) across states and weeks to minimize cumulative imported infections and deaths. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence drops, more relaxed schedules can be considered. This approach ensures flexibility and robustness in traffic policies to mitigate COVID-19 spread effectively."

New Mexico, with lower infections, is given a relaxed-first pattern to maintain mobility while monitoring risks. This staggered approach balances epidemic control and economic mobility needs. Quantitatively, imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/population); thus, reducing ft early for high-risk origins lowers cumulative cases and deaths. Sensitivity to beta and prevalence suggests that if transmission rates or infection prevalence increase, the strict-first pattern's importance rises. Coordination across states ensures Arizona's epidemic curve is flattened by delaying and reducing imported infections, enabling better local response and healthcare capacity management."

States with higher infection prevalence (Mississippi, Texas) have stricter controls front-loaded to reduce early seeding, while lower prevalence states (New Mexico) have relaxed controls later to maintain mobility. Virginia's moderate risk is handled with an even distribution to avoid spikes in importation. This cross-state approach balances the total incoming flow while minimizing cumulative infections and fatalities by reducing peak importation risk. The sensitivity of this policy is high to prevalence and transmission rate (beta); if infections rise, stricter front-loaded controls become more beneficial, while lower beta values reduce the necessity for very strict early restrictions. Cooperation across weeks and states helps spread the risk temporally and spatially, allowing Arizona to manage its epidemic curve more effectively."
