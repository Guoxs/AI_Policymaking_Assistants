This cooperative strategy reduces the cumulative imported infections and deaths in Texas by suppressing early seeding events that could amplify local transmission. Quantitatively, allocations balance the total inbound flow constraint while adjusting weekly proportions to reduce risk when prevalence is highest. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become even more crucial to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta reduces, more relaxed early allocations could be considered. The chosen strict-first pattern across states balances epidemic control with mobility needs, offering a practical and effective approach to managing cross-state traffic during ongoing disease spread.'

This temporal staggering minimizes simultaneous importation peaks that could exacerbate Texas's epidemic. Risk balancing ensures that total inflow remains constant but distributed to reduce early pressure on Texas's healthcare. Sensitivity analysis indicates that higher beta or prevalence would necessitate stricter early controls; conversely, lower prevalence allows more relaxed policies. These allocations optimize the trade-off between epidemic suppression and economic mobility by adapting weekly flows based on origin state risk profiles and Texas's current epidemic status."

States with lower prevalence like New Mexico have more relaxed flows later to support mobility. This cross-state risk balancing reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths in Texas by preventing simultaneous peak importation pressure. The quantitative cooperation logic uses infection prevalence ratios and flow baselines to distribute restrictions temporally, mitigating risk peaks without reducing total flow. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if beta or prevalence increases, stricter early controls become more critical to curb importations, while lower beta or prevalence may allow more relaxed policies. Overall, this policy minimizes Texas' epidemic burden by dynamically managing imported infection risks through temporal traffic control allocations."
