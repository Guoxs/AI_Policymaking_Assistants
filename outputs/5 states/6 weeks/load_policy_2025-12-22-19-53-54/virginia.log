States with higher infected-to-population ratios (e.g., Mississippi and Arizona) face stricter early-week controls to reduce initial imported infections, while states with lower infection prevalence (Texas) allow more relaxed traffic later to balance mobility. Even or phased relaxation patterns smooth infection pressure over the 6 weeks, preventing surges. This cross-state balancing leverages mobility baseline data and epidemic states to allocate risk temporally, mitigating peak importation. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early control fractions should be increased, especially for high-risk states. Conversely, if prevalence or beta fall, fractions may be relaxed earlier. This adaptive approach optimizes epidemic control while preserving essential mobility.'

This strategy reduces early imported infections when Virginia is most vulnerable, slowing epidemic growth and deaths. Balancing weeks with lower and higher fractions distributes risk temporally, preventing overwhelming Virginia's healthcare. The sum constraints ensure total inflow remains constant, preserving overall connectivity while adjusting timing. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early restrictions become more critical. Conversely, if prevalence drops, more even or relaxed patterns can be considered. This cooperative, data-driven approach minimizes cumulative infections and deaths in Virginia by strategically timing inbound traffic control based on origin state risk profiles."

New Mexico, with low prevalence, has even distribution to maintain mobility with minimal risk. This coordinated approach balances epidemic control and economic considerations by reducing initial seeding risk while allowing gradual reopening. Quantitatively, weekly fractions adjust the risk of imported infections by modulating flow*I/pop over time, smoothing potential surges. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta lowers, the model would tolerate more relaxed early fractions. This dynamic and differential allocation across origin states and weeks optimizes Virginia's epidemic control while preserving necessary mobility."
