By enacting stricter controls at the beginning and gradually increasing mobility as conditions improve, we balance public health concerns with the need for movement and economic activity. This strategy allows for real-time adjustments based on infection trends. Should infection rates or transmission dynamics change, the allocations can be adjusted accordingly to ensure that New Mexico remains protected against potential surges in cases. Sensitively, any variations in prevalence or transmission parameters (beta) would necessitate a reevaluation of the flow allocations to maintain effective control.'

The allocation strategy of starting with stricter control helps to create a buffer against potential spikes in cases, allowing for a gradual increase in mobility as conditions stabilize. Furthermore, if infection rates or beta values change, the strategy may need to be adjusted to maintain efficacy. Sensitivity analysis suggests that even small changes in prevalence could significantly impact the number of expected imported infections and deaths, reinforcing the need for adaptable traffic control measures.'
