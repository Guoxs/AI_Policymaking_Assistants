Each state has been assessed based on their current epidemiological status, leading to a strategy that balances mobility and public health. The cooperation logic is established by allowing higher flows from states with lower infection rates, while states with higher rates face stricter controls. Sensitively, if any state's prevalence increases unexpectedly, the model should adapt by reducing their inbound fractions further to avoid overwhelming Mississippi's healthcare system."

By implementing a strict-first to relaxed-first allocation strategy, we mitigate the risk of overwhelming the healthcare system while allowing for essential mobility. The idea is to balance the need for economic activity with public health safety. If the prevalence or beta values change, we would need to adjust the fractions accordingly to reflect the increased risk of transmission. Sensitivity analysis shows that tighter controls during high-risk periods are crucial for reducing the overall impact of the epidemic.'

By applying a strict-first approach for states with higher infection rates like Texas and a more balanced approach for states like Arizona and New Mexico, we can manage mobility while controlling the epidemic. The total inbound flow for each state remains constant over the 6 weeks, allowing for a gradual adjustment based on real-time epidemiological data. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if the beta value increases or prevalence rises, stricter controls might be required, potentially leading to lower allowable inflows. Thus, the allocations are designed to adaptively respond to changing conditions while balancing public health and mobility needs.'

By analyzing the SEIQRD parameters and expected incoming flow, we can minimize the potential influx of infections. The strategy involves a stricter first approach for states with higher infection rates and a more relaxed approach for those with lower rates. This risk balancing ensures that Mississippi can manage its resources effectively. Sensitivity analyses would show that if the prevalence of infections or the transmission rate (beta) increases, the allocations may need to be adjusted to further restrict flow from higher-risk states. Overall, these allocations aim to protect public health while considering the need for mobility.'
