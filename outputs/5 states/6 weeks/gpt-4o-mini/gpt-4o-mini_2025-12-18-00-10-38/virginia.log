By enforcing stricter controls in states with higher infection rates while allowing for some mobility from lower-risk states, we can balance epidemic control with essential travel needs. The traffic allocation patterns are designed to distribute risk over the weeks, ensuring that flow does not exceed manageable levels. Should the prevalence or transmission rates vary, we may need to adjust these allocations, as increased risk could necessitate stricter controls across the board. This flexible yet cautious approach is essential for effective epidemic management.'
