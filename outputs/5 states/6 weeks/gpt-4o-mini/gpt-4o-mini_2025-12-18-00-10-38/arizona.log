Lower flows in the initial weeks can effectively decrease the risk of overwhelming Arizona's healthcare resources, especially with inbound traffic from higher prevalence states like Texas and Mississippi. The logic behind this cooperation lies in the shared responsibility of managing disease spread across state lines. Should the rates of infection or transmission parameters change (e.g., an increase in beta), the sensitivity of these allocations would shift towards stricter controls across all states, adjusting the flow to maintain public health safety."

By utilizing a mix of strict-first and relaxed-first strategies, we are able to balance the need for mobility with the necessity of controlling the spread of disease. Each state's inflow is strategically adjusted to prevent overwhelming the healthcare system while still allowing for essential travel. If the prevalence or transmission rates adjust significantly, the proposed allocations would need reevaluation to ensure that Arizona's epidemic control remains effective. The sensitivity of the model suggests that even small changes in infection rates can lead to larger impacts on overall case numbers."

By implementing a strict-first approach, states with higher infection rates will see lower inflows initially, reducing the risk of overwhelming healthcare systems. This strategy helps maintain a balance between controlling the epidemic and allowing some degree of mobility for economic activity. The collaboration across states ensures that as infection trends fluctuate, adjustments can be made, minimizing the overall impact on public health. If infection rates were to rise unexpectedly in any state, the fractions could be re-evaluated, emphasizing the need for flexibility in response. Overall, these measures represent a proactive approach to managing cross-state mobility while prioritizing the health and safety of Arizona's residents."
