The expected imported infections can be estimated as: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/population). With a baseline inflow of 5765.86, the traffic allocation follows a strict-first pattern to mitigate risk, especially in the initial weeks. This pattern is justified given the current infection pressure and the need to control the spread. The fractions allocated for the first weeks are lower to limit imported cases, gradually increasing as conditions improve. The total fractions sum to 1."

The traffic control policy adopts a strict-first pattern in the initial weeks, where lower fractions will help reduce the potential influx of infections.

The quantitative cooperation logic indicates that by controlling flow in the early weeks, the cumulative risk of imported cases decreases significantly. If the prevalence or beta values change, the proposed allocations may need to be adjusted to maintain the balance between mobility and epidemic control.
