Given the current inbound flow of approximately 5838.29 daily, the expected imported infections can be calculated as imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/population). The allocation follows a strict-first pattern, as we want to minimize the influx during early weeks while gradually increasing it. The trade-off here is to limit mobility to prevent any spikes in cases in Virginia. The fractions sum to 1, ensuring compliance."
