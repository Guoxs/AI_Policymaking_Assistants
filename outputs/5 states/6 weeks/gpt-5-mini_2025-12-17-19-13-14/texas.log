    "notes": "Risk interpretation: New Mexico has a large susceptible population (S＞1.70M) with low E (＞7.7k) and low I (＞2.0k), implying low immediate importation risk. Quantitative logic: expected imported infectious ~ Flow * ft * (I/population); with Flow=87,558.19/day and low I/pop, imported infections are comparatively small. Pattern chosen: relaxed-first. Rationale: allow higher flow earlier to preserve mobility/economic activity while overall risk remains low; progressively tighten to hedge against rising prevalence. Trade-offs: relaxed early travel increases mobility but slightly raises imported risk; because baseline prevalence is low, this is an acceptable trade. Validation: fractions sum exactly to 1.0000."

Quantitative logic: imported_infected ＞ Flow * ft * (I / population); with Flow=30,676.67/day, imports scale linearly with ft and I/pop. Pattern chosen: strict-first. Rationale: reduce early seeding risk by front-loading restrictions then easing, because E indicates continued risk growth if unchecked. Trade-offs: moderate early restrictions reduce seeding while preserving later mobility. Validation: fractions sum exactly to 1.0000."
