Quantitative logic: expected imported infected ＞ Flow * ft * (I / population) so early-week imported cases scale as 1393.52 * ft * 0.001105. Pattern: relaxed-first 〞 I deliberately front-load weeks 1每2 (0.25, 0.20) to allow mobility where health system impact is small and to preserve economic activity, shifting stricter control mid-weeks as surveillance improves. Trade-offs: this increases early import risk slightly but uses low Flow and relatively small absolute risk to avoid harsh mobility restrictions. Validation: fractions sum to exactly 1.0000."

Pattern: strict-first 〞 front-load strict controls (weeks 1每2 low ft) to prevent strong seeding from a relatively high-prevalence source; allow staged relaxation later when local containment and testing are reinforced.

Conversely, if testing/isolation improves (effective delta or Q isolation), risk per traveler falls and ft can be relaxed earlier.
