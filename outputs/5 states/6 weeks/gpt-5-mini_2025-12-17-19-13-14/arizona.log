Quantitative logic: imported infectious ＞ Flow * f_t * (I/pop). Because Flow is large, even small f_t produce many imports; lowering f1-f2 yields substantial reduction in early imported cases. Pattern chosen: strict-first. We sharply restrict early weeks to prevent rapid seeding in Arizona and buy time for case detection and response.

Quantitative logic: expected imported infected ＞ Flow * f_t * (I/pop); with Flow=34142.76 and very small I/pop, imports remain small even when f_t is large. Pattern chosen: relaxed-first.
