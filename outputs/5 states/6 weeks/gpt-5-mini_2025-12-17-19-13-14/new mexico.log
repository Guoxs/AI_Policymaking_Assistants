Pattern chosen: relaxed-first. Rationale: allow higher share early (weeks 1每3) when local transmission is moderate, shifting restrictions later to catch downstream risk as exposed convert to infectious. Trade-offs: this favors mobility and economic activity early while accepting small near-term import risk; it delays stricter controls to avoid abrupt economic disruption. Validation: the six fractions sum to exactly 1.0000 as required."

Quantitative logic: expected imported infectious ~ Flow * f_t * (I / population). Even with a modest Flow (~1.55k/day), the per-traveler infection risk is high, so imported infections scale with f_t. Pattern chosen: strict-first. Rationale: front-load strict controls (very low f in weeks 1每2) to sharply reduce importation while local case ascertainment and traveler screening ramp up. Trade-offs: tight early restrictions heavily limit mobility and may disrupt essential travel, but they substantially reduce imported cases and downstream deaths given the high prevalence. Validation: the listed fractions sum to exactly 1.0000."

Quantitative logic: imported infectious ＞ Flow * f_t * (I / population); because Flow is large, even small prevalence yields many imported cases if f_t is high. Pattern chosen: strict-first. Rationale: reduce early-week fractions to cut immediate import volume while preserving moderate mobility later as local controls and vaccination/testing improve. Trade-offs: early restrictions reduce cross-border economic and personal travel but yield disproportionate reductions in imported infections due to the high Flow. Validation: the six fractions exactly sum to 1.0000."

Quantitative logic: imported infectious ~ Flow * f_t * (I / population); with low Flow, absolute importation is small but nonzero. Pattern chosen: relaxed-first. Rationale: allocate more flow early weeks when capacity for testing and contact tracing in New Mexico remains robust, shifting modest reductions later to hedge against any late upticks. Trade-offs: relaxed early access supports travel and commerce while accepting small import risk; later tightening reduces residual long-tail importation. Validation: the fractions sum to 1.0000 exactly as required."

  "global_guidance": "Cross-state reasoning: collectively, the plan concentrates early restrictions on origins with the largest expected imported infections (Texas due to very high Flow and Mississippi due to extremely high prevalence), while permitting relatively higher early inflow from lower-prevalence or low-flow origins (Arizona, Virginia). Quantitative cooperation logic: expected imported infections per origin ＞ Flow * sum_t(f_t * I_origin / pop_origin). By minimizing f_t in early weeks for origin-states with either high I/pop or very large Flow, the aggregate imported infectious load into New Mexico over the risk window is reduced, lowering downstream confirmed cases and deaths given the SEIQRD transitions (E -> I via alpha, I -> Q via delta, Q -> R/D via gamma/mu). Risk-balancing across weeks staggers restrictions: strict-first for high-risk origins reduces near-term importation and buys time to expand testing, tracing, and local response; relaxed-first for lower-risk origins preserves essential mobility. Sensitivity reasoning: if prevalence or beta increases, early-week f_t must be reduced proportionally for high-Flow/high-prevalence origins to avoid multiplicative growth of imported seeds. Conversely, if effective vaccination or testing reduces I or lowers beta, fractions can be relaxed earlier. Continuous monitoring of origin I and E and adjusting weekly f_t (adaptive control) will maximize public-health benefits while minimizing socio-economic disruption."
