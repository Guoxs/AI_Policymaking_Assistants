This balances risk across weeks and states, minimizing early seeding events which could cause exponential growth. By maintaining total inflow per state, this approach respects mobility needs while prioritizing epidemic control. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early restrictions become even more critical. Conversely, lower prevalence or beta would allow more relaxed distributions.

Texas, with its large inflow and moderate infection pressure, employs an even distribution to avoid sudden surges in imported infections while maintaining economic activity. This cross-state balancing reduces the overall risk by smoothing imported infections over time and across sources, preventing healthcare overload. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or beta increases, stricter early controls become even more critical, especially for high inflow states. If prevalence declines, controls can be relaxed earlier. This dynamic allocation supports adaptive, data-driven epidemic control while preserving necessary mobility.'

States with lower infection pressure or inflow (New Mexico, Virginia) have more even or slightly relaxed early-week allocations. This cross-state coordination balances total inflow across 6 weeks while minimizing cumulative imported infections and deaths by shifting traffic away from high-risk weeks and states. Sensitivity analysis shows that if transmission rate beta increases or infected prevalence changes, stricter early controls would become more critical. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more even or relaxed allocations may be optimal. This dynamic allocation approach provides flexibility to adapt to changing epidemic conditions while maintaining constant total inflow per state, thus preserving overall mobility demands."

States with higher infection rates or exposed populations (Texas, Virginia) have stricter early controls or even allocation to limit peak import risk, while states with lower infection burdens (Arizona, New Mexico) adopt a gradual relaxation pattern to balance control and mobility. This cross-state cooperation balances total flow while reducing infection pressure across weeks, preventing simultaneous high-risk peaks. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls would be prioritized more heavily to counterbalance higher importation risks. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed early fractions could be considered to enhance mobility without compromising epidemic control. This adaptive, data-driven strategy ensures a robust response to evolving epidemiological and mobility conditions.'

By front-loading stringent control in the first weeks (lower fractions), we reduce the likelihood of early epidemic amplification from imported cases. Subsequent gradual relaxation leverages declining infection prevalence in origin states and maintains socio-economic mobility. Quantitatively, importing infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/population); balancing this risk across states and weeks reduces cumulative incidence and deaths. Sensitivity analyses highlight that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls yield greater benefits. Conversely, if prevalence drops, the policy can be relaxed earlier. This coordinated approach ensures a balanced risk-mobility trade-off, optimizing epidemic control across the interconnected states.'

This approach reduces the cumulative imported infection pressure during critical early weeks, leveraging incubation (alpha) and confirmation delays (delta) to flatten the imported infection curve. By shifting traffic from high prevalence and high inflow states to later weeks, the policy allows time for local epidemic mitigation, reducing secondary transmission in Mississippi. Sensitivity analysis suggests if prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early restrictions should be amplified. Conversely, improvements in recovery (gamma) or lower death rates (mu) may allow more relaxed flows. This coordinated inter-state traffic modulation balances epidemic control with economic mobility, minimizing overall infections and deaths.'
