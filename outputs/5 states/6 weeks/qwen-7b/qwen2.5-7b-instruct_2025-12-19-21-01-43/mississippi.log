However, it still has a significant average daily inbound flow (Flow=4459.81). The risk of imported infections is moderate. We recommend a 'relaxed-first' approach to start with more open traffic and then gradually tighten controls to manage the imported cases effectively.

  "global_guidance": "To minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Mississippi, we recommend a coordinated approach where stricter controls are applied first from high-risk states like Arizona and Texas, and then more relaxed controls are introduced from states with lower risks such as Virginia and New Mexico. This strategy ensures that the initial influx of cases is controlled, reducing the peak burden on Mississippi's healthcare system. The 'even' distribution for New Mexico and 'relaxed-first' for Virginia and Texas helps in maintaining a balanced approach to both epidemic control and mobility.
