      "notes": "Arizona has a relatively lower number of infected individuals compared to Virginia, with an average of 1898 cases over the past 21 days. However, the average daily inbound flow from Arizona is significant at 5763.29. Given the current high number of confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia, we aim to minimize imported infections. By allocating inbound traffic in a pattern of strict-first (low ft values in the first few weeks) and then gradually relaxing controls, we can effectively reduce the initial influx of infected individuals without overly restricting mobility. This pattern ensures that the total inbound flow over 6 weeks remains consistent with the ground truth while managing the risk of imported infections."
