The inflow from Arizona is also significant, contributing approximately 28201.62 daily inbound cases.

This strategy leverages the decreasing trend in infection pressure in some states and the relatively stable situation in others. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if the prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, the fractions should be adjusted accordingly to maintain a safe threshold. Conversely, if these factors decrease, the allocations can be relaxed to promote economic recovery while still protecting public health."
