However, considering its current high number of exposed and infected individuals (E=17911, I=8564), there is a potential for significant imported infections. By allocating a moderate amount of traffic control (ft=0.15) in each of the six weeks, we aim to balance the risk of importing infections without overly disrupting the mobility from a state with lower average flows. This pattern is chosen as a 'relaxed-first' approach, recognizing the need to ease restrictions initially while still maintaining a cautious stance."

With a higher number of exposed and infected individuals (E=31263, I=7410), Virginia's contribution to imported infections is notable. We recommend a 'relaxed-first' approach where stricter controls are implemented in the first half of the period (ft=0.1) to protect against initial risks, followed by a more relaxed pattern (ft=0.2 and ft=0.3) in the latter weeks. This strategy helps to manage the risk while also accommodating the need for mobility."
