Given its proximity and the high average daily inbound flow (1551), we need to apply strict controls early on to prevent a surge in imported cases.

This strategy ensures that the total inbound flow remains constant over the 6 weeks while adapting to varying risks and mobility patterns. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or beta increases, we would need to tighten controls further, especially in the earlier weeks.
