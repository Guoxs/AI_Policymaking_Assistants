Mississippi, Texas, and Virginia pose higher risks due to their larger exposed and infected populations, leading to stricter controls initially. New Mexico, despite having a smaller population, also requires caution due to its high inbound flow. By distributing the traffic allocation evenly and strictly at the beginning, followed by gradual relaxation, we aim to prevent sudden surges in cases while allowing for some mobility. This phased approach ensures that the state can adapt to changing risk conditions and cooperate effectively across states to balance the overall imported infection rate.'
