      "notes": "Arizona has a relatively high number of infected individuals (I=962) and a significant daily average inbound flow to Virginia (3457.43). Given its current infection rate and the potential for importing infections, we recommend a strict-first approach. This means initially reducing the flow to maintain lower transmission rates during the peak of the incoming infection wave. As the weeks progress, the flow can gradually increase to balance the need for mobility with epidemic control. This pattern is chosen because it allows us to mitigate the initial surge of imported infections while still maintaining some level of normalcy."

We recommend a more balanced approach, starting with moderate restrictions and gradually easing them. This is because New Mexico's infection rate is not as high, but its contribution to the inbound flow is significant.

Given the high risk of importing infections, we advise a strict-first approach, with a focus on reducing the initial flow to minimize the impact of the high infection rate in Texas. As the weeks progress, the flow can be increased, but only after assessing the effectiveness of the initial restrictions. This strategy helps to prevent a sudden surge in cases and gives time for Virginia to prepare for the expected influx."
  },
  "global_guidance": "To effectively control the spread of the epidemic in Virginia, we need to carefully manage the inbound flows from various states. By adopting a strict-first approach for Arizona and Mississippi, we can significantly reduce the initial risk of importing infections. For New Mexico and Texas, where the infection rates are higher, a more balanced approach is recommended to ensure that both public health and economic needs are met. The quantitative cooperation logic involves distributing the inflow across weeks to avoid overwhelming the healthcare system and to provide sufficient time for Virginia to implement and evaluate control measures. Sensitivity reasoning suggests that if the prevalence or beta (transmission rate) were to increase, the strictness of the first few weeks would need to be adjusted accordingly to maintain control over imported infections."

Given its high inflow (5763.29), we aim to reduce the risk of importing infections by applying stricter controls early on. The chosen pattern of even reduction (0.20, 0.18, 0.16, 0.14, 0.12, 0.10) balances the need to control the influx with maintaining some level of mobility. This approach is justified because the risk of imported infections decreases as the weeks progress, allowing for a gradual relaxation of controls. The trade-off here is ensuring that the initial peak of infections does not overwhelm Virginia's healthcare system while still allowing for necessary mobility.

The pattern of even reduction (0.20, 0.18, 0.16, 0.14, 0.12, 0.10) ensures a balanced approach throughout the 6-week period.

We adopt a strict-first pattern (0.20, 0.18, 0.16, 0.14, 0.12, 0.10) to start with higher restrictions and gradually relax them. This approach is justified by the ongoing high infection pressure in Texas, which justifies a more aggressive initial response. The trade-off involves potentially reducing economic activity and social interactions early on, but this is necessary to prevent a large-scale importation of infections.

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia, we recommend a coordinated approach where each state's inbound traffic allocation is designed to balance the risk of imported infections. By applying stricter controls from states with higher infection rates (like Texas and Arizona) at the beginning and gradually relaxing them, we can manage the overall influx of infections. This strategy ensures that Virginia's healthcare system is not overwhelmed by a sudden surge of imported cases. Additionally, by maintaining a consistent level of controls across all states, we avoid creating hotspots where the risk of imported infections could spike unexpectedly. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if the prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, the recommended fractions should be adjusted to be more restrictive earlier in the 6-week period to effectively manage the risk. Conversely, if the prevalence decreases, the fractions can be relaxed to support economic recovery without significantly increasing the risk of imported infections."
