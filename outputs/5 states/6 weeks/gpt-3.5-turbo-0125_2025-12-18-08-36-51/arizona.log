  "mississippi": {
      "fractions": [0.05, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.2, 0.15],
      "notes": "For mississippi, the risk of imported infections is mainly dependent on the number of infected individuals. Given the higher number of infected cases in mississippi, a stricter traffic control policy is recommended initially to reduce the risk of transmission. The pattern chosen is strict-first to initially limit the influx of infected individuals and then gradually ease restrictions to maintain a balance between epidemic control and mobility. The allocated fractions ensure that the total inbound flow over 6 weeks remains constant while minimizing the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in arizona. The trade-off lies in balancing the need to reduce imported infections with the necessity of maintaining some level of mobility."

  "new mexico": {
      "fractions": [0.1, 0.2, 0.25, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1],
      "notes": "For new mexico, the risk of imported infections is relatively lower compared to other origin states. The allocated fractions follow a pattern of relaxed-first, allowing for a more gradual easing of traffic control measures to balance epidemic control and mobility. By initially allowing a higher proportion of inbound flow and then gradually reducing it, the policy aims to minimize the impact of imported infections while maintaining some level of inter-state mobility. The trade-off involves managing the risk of transmission from new mexico while ensuring the flow of goods and services between states."

      "fractions": [0.15, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1],
      "notes": "For texas, the risk of imported infections is significant due to the high number of infected cases. A balanced approach is taken with a pattern of even distribution of traffic control measures over the 6 weeks. This approach aims to maintain a steady level of inbound flow while minimizing the risk of transmission from texas. The trade-off involves ensuring the safety of arizona residents by controlling the influx of infected individuals while allowing for essential travel and trade to continue between the states."

The chosen pattern is to start with a stricter control and then gradually relax it to allow for a controlled flow of traffic. By adjusting the fractions over the 6 weeks, the policy aims to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in arizona while managing the trade-off between epidemic control and maintaining essential economic activities. The validation ensures that the total inbound flow remains constant while reducing the risk of imported infections."
  },
  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies for each origin state aim to collectively reduce the expected imported infections and deaths in arizona by strategically adjusting the inbound traffic allocations over 6 weeks. By implementing a combination of strict-first, relaxed-first, and even distribution patterns based on the risk of imported infections from each state, the overall goal is to minimize the impact of external transmission while allowing for essential travel and trade. The quantitative cooperation logic involves balancing the risk of transmission across weeks and states to effectively control the spread of the disease. Sensitivity reasoning includes assessing how variations in prevalence rates and transmission parameters could influence the effectiveness of the traffic control policies."
