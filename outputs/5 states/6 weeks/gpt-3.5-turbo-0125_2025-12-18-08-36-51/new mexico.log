      "notes": "For Arizona, the risk of transmission is relatively high due to the moderate number of infected individuals. The expected imported infections can be estimated as imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population). We observe a pattern of relaxed-first approach in traffic allocation to balance epidemic control with mobility. This pattern allows for a gradual decrease in inbound traffic over time while minimizing the risk of increased infections. The trade-off between epidemic control and mobility is crucial to prevent overwhelming the healthcare system."

The quantitative logic suggests that imported infections can be approximated as imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population).
