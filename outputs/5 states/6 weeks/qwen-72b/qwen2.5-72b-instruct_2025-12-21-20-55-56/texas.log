Cross-state Reasoning: By distributing traffic more evenly over the 6 weeks, we can reduce the peak influx of infected individuals, thereby flattening the curve and minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Texas. 2. Quantitative Cooperation Logic: The even distribution pattern helps balance the risk across weeks, ensuring that no single week sees a significant spike in imported infections. 3. Sensitivity Reasoning: If the prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter controls in the initial weeks would be more effective in reducing the overall impact. Conversely, if these factors decrease, a more relaxed approach might be feasible. The chosen patterns aim to strike a balance, providing flexibility to adjust based on real-time data."
