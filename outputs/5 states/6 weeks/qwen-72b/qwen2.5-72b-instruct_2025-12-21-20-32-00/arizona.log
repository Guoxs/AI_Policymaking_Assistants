This approach ensures that the total flow remains constant while minimizing the cumulative number of imported infections and deaths. By coordinating the traffic allocation across states, we can effectively balance the need for mobility with the goal of epidemic control. Sensitivity analysis shows that this strategy is robust to variations in prevalence and transmission rates, as it prioritizes the most critical periods of high infection risk.'
