Texas, with lower prevalence, permits a more even distribution to maintain economic activity. This cooperative balancing optimizes the cumulative case and death reduction in Mississippi by front-loading restrictions where infection pressure is highest, reducing the effective reproduction number early in the 6-week horizon. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls would yield greater benefits, and vice versa. This dynamic allocation minimizes overall epidemic impact while preserving mobility where risk is lower.'

This staggered approach reduces cumulative infection importation pressure on Mississippi, flattening its epidemic curve. The quantitative logic uses prevalence-weighted flow modulation (Flow*ft*(I/population)) to allocate traffic. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls would be required especially for high-risk origins. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, controls can be relaxed earlier. The cooperation mechanism balances risk across time and states to optimize epidemic outcomes while maintaining essential mobility.'

States with higher infection prevalence (Texas) receive stricter early restrictions (lower fractions in initial weeks) to minimize early imported infections that can seed outbreaks. States with lower prevalence (Arizona, New Mexico) have moderate restrictions early, relaxing later. Virginia is balanced evenly to maintain steady flow while controlling risks. This cooperative allocation reduces cumulative infections and deaths in Mississippi by spreading control efforts to times of higher local susceptibility and infection pressure. Sensitivity to changes in infection prevalence or transmission rate beta implies stricter early controls may be needed if conditions worsen, or more relaxation if prevalence decreases. The sum of fractions per state equals exactly 1.0, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant while optimizing temporal distribution to minimize epidemic impact.'

By front-loading restrictions, the model reduces the seeding of new cases that could exacerbate outbreaks and deaths. The total inbound flows remain constant per state, preserving mobility volume but shifting timing to reduce risk concentration. This cross-state coordination balances infection pressure, preventing compounded risk from multiple sources simultaneously. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence declines, modest relaxation earlier is possible. Overall, this strategy optimally distributes risk over time and origins to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi."

This reduces initial seeding and subsequent local spread. Lower-risk states like New Mexico receive milder restrictions, reflecting their lower infected prevalence. The strategy balances public health with mobility needs by gradually relaxing controls over six weeks, allowing economic activities to resume as local epidemic control improves. Quantitatively, imported infections relate to Flow*ft*(I/population), so front-loading restrictions on high I states effectively reduces cumulative cases. Sensitivity to changes in transmission rate beta or prevalence would require adjusting strictness levels; higher beta or prevalence would lean toward more aggressive early restrictions to prevent outbreaks. This coordinated multi-state approach achieves a balanced and effective epidemic control strategy.'

By front-loading stricter control, the policy reduces seeding of new cases, allowing the local epidemic to stabilize and preventing exponential growth. As weeks progress and local control improves, controls relax to permit necessary mobility. Quantitatively, imported infections depend on Flow * ft * (I / Population) for each state and week, so adjusting ft to be lower earlier reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths. Balancing mobility needs with epidemic control is crucial, thus the gradual relaxation. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls become even more beneficial. Conversely, if local control improves rapidly, controls could relax sooner. This coordinated approach across states ensures that high-risk origins like Texas and Virginia have stronger early restrictions, while lower-risk states maintain moderate control, optimizing overall epidemic outcomes in Mississippi."
