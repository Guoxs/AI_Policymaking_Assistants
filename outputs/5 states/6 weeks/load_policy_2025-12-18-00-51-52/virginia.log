States with higher infection prevalence and lower population (mississippi, arizona) receive stricter control later or early to reduce imported infections, while large low-prevalence states (texas) maintain higher mobility initially with some tapering. This cooperation balances epidemic control and economic mobility. Sensitivity analysis indicates if beta or infection prevalence increases, stricter and earlier control is needed. Conversely, lower prevalence or transmission allows more relaxed policies. The sum-to-one constraint for fractions preserves total flow, redistributing it across weeks to flatten imported infection peaks and manage healthcare load.'

This reduces early imported infections during Virginia's vulnerable phase, slowing epidemic growth and deaths. States with lower infection pressure (new mexico) receive more even allocations, balancing mobility and risk. By smoothing inbound flows over six weeks while maintaining total inflow, the approach mitigates peaks that could overwhelm control. Sensitivity to prevalence and transmission rates (beta) means stricter or more relaxed controls could be adjusted if infection rates increase or decrease. This cooperative balancing across states and weeks optimizes cumulative health outcomes in Virginia while preserving essential mobility."

For lower prevalence New Mexico, a more even traffic distribution maintains mobility without sacrificing control. This cross-state balancing reduces cumulative infections and deaths by concentrating risk mitigation when and where it matters most, exploiting temporal dynamics of epidemic spread. Quantitatively, imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/S), so lowering ft in high-risk weeks reduces seeding. Sensitivity to parameters like beta means if transmission rises, stricter early controls become even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence declines, allocations could relax faster. This coordinated temporal and spatial strategy optimizes epidemic control while preserving necessary mobility.'

States with lower prevalence (New Mexico) receive more balanced traffic allocation. This cross-state strategy balances epidemic suppression with essential mobility. Quantitatively, imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing ft in early weeks for high-risk states substantially cuts total imported cases. The 6-week allocation sums to 1 per state, preserving total flow but shifting timing. Sensitivity analysis shows that if transmission rate beta increases, stricter and longer front-loaded control periods become more critical. Conversely, if prevalence drops, controls can be relaxed faster. This adaptive, risk-based approach optimally mitigates Virginia's epidemic while maintaining necessary mobility."

This approach mitigates seeding of new cases in Virginia, reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. The fractions balance epidemic control and mobility by gradually relaxing restrictions as infection pressure decreases over time. Quantitatively, imported infections approximate Flow*ft*(I/population), so lowering ft early in weeks with higher infection prevalence in origin states significantly cuts importation. Coordination among states ensures that no week has uniformly high flows from all origins, distributing risk. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls yield greater benefits, whereas if prevalence declines rapidly, relaxation could be faster. This dynamic policy optimally adapts inbound traffic to epidemic risks, balancing public health and mobility needs."

Strict-first scheduling reduces the seeding risk in Virginia's susceptible population, minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. The total inbound flow for each state is conserved by redistributing weekly proportions without altering overall volume. Quantitatively, imported infections scale with daily flow, infection prevalence, and weekly fractions; balancing these factors across states reduces peak infectious pressure. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if transmission rate beta or prevalence increases, stricter early restrictions yield greater benefit. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, a more relaxed schedule could be considered. This coordinated approach ensures a balanced epidemic control strategy while allowing gradual restoration of mobility over the 6 weeks."
