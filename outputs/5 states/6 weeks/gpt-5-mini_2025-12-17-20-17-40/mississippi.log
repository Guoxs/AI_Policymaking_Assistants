This reduces the expected imported infectious arrivals in the critical initial weeks when Mississippi's susceptible pool is large, thereby lowering cumulative local transmission. Quantitative cooperation logic: because imported_infected  Flow * ft * (I / population), small proportional reductions in ft for high I/pop origins yield outsized reductions in imported seeds; we concentrate stricter ft reductions in weeks 1-2 for NM and VA and redistribute that deferred volume to later weeks when we hope local controls or prevalence improve. Balancing across states avoids creating synchronized surges; e.g., modest reductions for TX (large Flow, low I/pop) are spread evenly to avoid an accumulation of arrivals in any one later week. Sensitivity reasoning: if prevalence (I or E) or transmissibility beta increases, the marginal benefit of stricter early ft grows nonlinearly because secondary transmission multiplies imported seeds. Conversely, if beta falls or local testing/isolation improves, the policy can be relaxed earlier. Recommended monitoring: track origin I/E trends weekly and adjust ft to maintain imported_infected below operational thresholds for testing and contact tracing capacity."

Texas accounts for the bulk of projected daily imports (~2.65/day baseline), so strict early reductions there deliver the largest marginal reductions in imported infections and consequent local transmission. Virginia, with the highest prevalence, is the next priority. Arizona and New Mexico have very low prevalence and small baseline import contributions, so even allocation minimizes mobility disruption while producing little epidemic risk. Quantitative cooperation logic: concentrating reductions early compresses import pressure when Mississippi has meaningful susceptible population and allows later relaxation to recover mobility while relying on additional local measures (testing, contact tracing, vaccination). Because total 6-week flow per origin is conserved, this timing reshapes risk rather than inventing mobility reductions; imported infections are roughly proportional to Flow * sum(f_t * I/pop). Sensitivity reasoning: if prevalence (I/pop) or beta increases, the marginal benefit of stricter early reductions grows  particularly for high-flow/high-prevalence origins (Texas/Virginia). Conversely, if local Mississippi control (beta, detection, isolation) improves, the necessity for severe mobility limits falls and fractions can be flattened. Recommended operational co-measures: ramp up testing/quarantine for incoming travelers, prioritize screening from high-prevalence origins, and monitor week-to-week prevalence to adapt f_t dynamically.'

Arizona receives an even allocation because its per-traveler risk is low and even flow minimizes operational disruption; New Mexico is slightly front-loaded but moderate because absolute Flow is small. Quantitative cooperation logic: imported cases  _states Flow_state * ft_state_week * (I_state/pop_state + k*E_state/pop_state) where k[0.2C0.6] reflects fraction of E likely to become infectious during transit/short horizon. Lower ft in early weeks for high-prevalence states reduces imported infections when local containment capacity is most needed; later weeks absorb deferred travel when local prevalence and capacity improve. Sensitivity reasoning: outcomes scale with origin prevalence and transmission beta  if beta in Mississippi increases, earlier and stronger reductions (lower ft early) yield larger marginal benefits; if origin I or E increases, shift more weight to strict-first for that origin. This plan balances epidemic control and mobility by trading timing (not total volume) to minimize peak importation and resulting secondary transmission.'

Because imported infectious ~ Flow * ft * (I/pop), the largest marginal benefit per unit reduction in ft comes from origins with the largest product Flow*(I/pop); Texas (very large Flow) and Virginia (high I/pop) dominate this product. Quantitative cooperation logic: by compressing a substantial fraction of inbound volume into later weeks for Texas/Virginia, Mississippi gains breathing room to detect, isolate, and vaccinate or deploy targeted NPIs; aggregated imports over 6 weeks remain equal to baseline but temporal smoothing reduces peak transmission risk. Sensitivity reasoning: if prevalence (I/pop) rises faster than estimated, earlier and deeper reductions in ft produce outsized benefits; if transmission rate beta increases locally, the value of early restrictions is amplified. Conversely, if prevalence falls quickly in an origin, we can re-weight ft toward earlier weeks. Operational note: monitor origin I and E weekly and adjust the weekly profile toward stricter-first if either I or E rises >20percent week-to-week.'

This reduces the number of imported infectious travelers arriving during the period when Mississippi's E (369,506) and I (163,730) are high, lowering the chance of renewed exponential growth. Quantitative cooperation logic: imported_infected_total_week_t  _states Flow_state * ft_state,t * (I_state / pop_state). By biasing ft lower in early weeksespecially for high-flow/high-prevalence Texas and higher-prevalence Virginiathe plan reduces the largest terms in this sum. The preserved total 6-week flow respects mobility needs, shifting travel to later weeks when local interventions (testing, isolation, vaccination) can be reinforced. Sensitivity reasoning: if prevalence or beta increase, early restrictions become even more valuable because imported infections scale linearly with (I/pop) and multiplicatively via beta into secondary cases. If prevalence falls faster than expected, later-week relaxation limits economic harm. This cooperative front-loading of control gives Mississippi time to reduce local E/I and increases the effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation policies in the critical early window."

Quantitatively, imported_infected_total_week_t  sum_over_states Flow_s * ft_s,t * (I_s / pop_s). By assigning low ft in early weeks for high-risk origins we reduce the weighted sum of ft*(I/pop) when it most matters for Mississippi's epidemic growth. Cooperation logic: balancing ft across states and weeks spreads the mobility burden  strict-first for high-risk states prevents immediate seeding, relaxed-first or even allocations for low-risk states preserve needed movement. Sensitivity reasoning: if prevalence (I/pop) rises in an origin or if beta increases, imported infections scale roughly linearly with (I/pop) and beta amplifies local transmission; in that case tighten early ft further (reduce early-week fractions). Conversely, if testing/isolation improves (effective delta or Q isolation), risk per traveler falls and ft can be relaxed earlier. Operational note: these allocations conserve the 6-week total Flow per origin (Flow * sum(ft)=Flow) while shifting timing to minimize cumulative infections and deaths in Mississippi."
