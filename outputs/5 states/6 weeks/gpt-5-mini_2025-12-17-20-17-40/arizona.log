The joint effect reduces expected imported infectious individuals in the critical early 2C3 weeks when Arizonas local containment would be most stressed. Quantitative cooperation logic: for each origin i and week t the imported-infected_i,t  Flow_i * f_{i,t} * (I_i / pop_i). By lowering f_{i,t} in early weeks for states with high (I/pop)*Flow, we achieve a larger absolute reduction in imported infections per unit of travel curtailed versus applying uniform cuts. This concentrates control where marginal benefit is highest. Sensitivity reasoning: if prevalence in an origin rises, the same f_t produces proportionally more imports  making early strict-first strategies even more valuable; if beta in Arizona increases (higher transmission), delaying imports is more crucial because each imported case seeds more secondary infections. Conversely, if prevalence drops or testing improves in origins, allocations can shift toward relaxed-first to restore mobility. The proposed allocations keep total 6-week volumes fixed while manipulating timing to minimize expected cumulative infections and deaths in Arizona, trading short-term mobility constraints for reduced seeding risk.'

Quantitative cooperation logic: for each origin we use imported_infected  Flow * ft * (I/pop) to compare contribution to Arizonas risk. Shifting weight from early to later weeks for high-prevalence states (strict-first) reduces near-term seeding and buys time for local surveillance, testing, and contact tracing; even or relaxed allocations for very low-prevalence origins preserve essential mobility. Balancing across states reduces total expected imported infections by concentrating controls where per-traveler risk is highest rather than applying uniform cuts. Sensitivity reasoning: results are sensitive to prevalence estimates and beta. If origin prevalence or beta increases, stricter front-loading and deeper reductions (lower early ft) should be applied; if prevalence falls or testing/isolation improves (lower effective beta), allocations can be relaxed earlier. Continuous monitoring of origin I/pop and Arizona case trends should trigger reallocation week-to-week to limit cumulative infections and deaths.'

New Mexico (very low prevalence but large border flow) is smoothed evenly to preserve essential movement and avoid concentrating risk later. Quantitative cooperation logic: expected imported infections per day  _orig Flow_orig * f_t(orig) * ((I+E)/pop_orig). By reducing f_t in early weeks for high-prevalence origins, we cut immediate imported infections and reduce the probability of initiating sustained chains in Arizona when local susceptible pool is large. We offset reduced early flow with higher later f_t to keep 6-week totals constant. Sensitivity: imported infections scale approximately linearly with origin prevalence and flow; if prevalence doubles in an origin the expected imported infections double, making strict-first allocation even more valuable. If beta (transmissibility) in Arizona rises, each imported case leads to larger secondary chains  so early suppression yields outsized benefits. Monitoring recommendation: update weekly with new prevalence and flows; if an origins (E+I)/pop increases by >50percent, shift to stronger early-week suppression immediately. This coordinated, targeted, and temporally-weighted allocation minimizes seeding risk while preserving aggregate mobility over six weeks.'

This reduces near-term imported infectious seeding into Arizona because imported cases scale with origin prevalence  flow. Quantitative cooperation logic: for each origin i and week t, imported_infected_{i,t}  Flow_i * ft_{i,t} * (I_i / Pop_i). By reducing ft in early weeks for high I/Pop states, cumulative imported infections across the 6-week window fall significantly even though total Flow is conserved. The schedule staggers relaxed traffic later, concentrating travel when Arizona has additional time to detect and isolate imported cases (high delta and ongoing testing). Sensitivity reasoning: if origin prevalence rises (I increases) or transmission beta increases in Arizona, the marginal benefit of early strictness grows  more aggressive front-loading of restrictions would be warranted. Conversely, if I estimates are overestimated or rapid vaccination/NPIs reduce local susceptibility, reallocating more flow earlier (especially from low-prevalence NM) is reasonable. Monitoring recommended: weekly re-evaluation of origin prevalence and Arizona measurements to reallocate ft dynamically and preserve healthcare capacity while minimizing socio-economic disruption.'

This reduces immediate imported infectious seeds into Arizona (imported  sum_over_states Flow_state * ft_state * (I_state/pop_state)), lowering the probability of early exponential local spread when Arizona's susceptible pool is large. Quantitative cooperation logic: because total inbound volume per origin over 6 weeks is fixed, the policy shifts temporal risk (front-load vs back-load). By concentrating stricter controls early on higher-prevalence origins, we reduce early introductions which have outsized impact on cumulative cases due to exponential growth; lower-risk origins can carry more early flow to reduce economic disruption. Sensitivity reasoning: results are most sensitive to origin I and to beta. If origin prevalence increases, stricter early ft should be tightened further; if community beta in Arizona rises (more transmission per case), the benefit of early strict reductions grows nonlinearly. Regular re-evaluation every 1C2 weeks with updated E/I and Flow data is recommended to reallocate weekly fractions and respond to changing prevalence or control capacity."

The expected imported infectious across all origins is approximately sum_over_origins[Flow_i * ft_i * (I_i+E_i)/Pop_i]; by reducing ft_i in early weeks for high (I+E)/Pop and/or high Flow origins we nonlinearly cut the number of new introductions that can trigger local exponential growth. Quantitative cooperation logic: the plan balances origins so total 6-week flow equals the ground-truth baseline but shifts temporal distribution to buy time  initial low ft lowers instantaneous imported case counts, allowing local test-trace/isolation and vaccination efforts to reduce internal susceptibility. Sensitivity reasoning: if prevalence in an origin increases or beta in Arizona rises, the marginal benefit of stricter early ft increases (i.e., more weight should be front-loaded); conversely, if origin prevalence falls or Arizonas control improves (lower beta, higher gamma), weekly ft can be relaxed earlier. This policy is robust: it reduces peak importation risk while preserving long-run mobility by reallocating, not eliminating, total inflow.'
