Arizona (low prevalence) receives an even profile to balance economic continuity and risk. Virginia (moderate prevalence, lower flow) is allowed relatively more early mobility. Quantitative cooperation logic: expected daily imported infectious cases from state j in week t  BaselineFlow_j * ft_j * (I_j / Pop_j). By decreasing ft_j in early weeks for high-risk j, cumulative imported cases across the 6-week horizon are reduced proportionally; the same total flow is preserved but delayed to weeks when local Texas detection and response capacity can be reinforced. Sensitivity reasoning: increases in transmission rate (beta) or higher true I/E would amplify the benefit of early restrictions, making stricter-first patterns more effective; conversely, if prevalence falls rapidly at origin, the planned relaxations later reduce economic harm with limited epidemiological cost. Recommendation: implement near-real-time surveillance of origin prevalence and Texas case trends, and be ready to re-weight weekly fractions (tighten early ft or compress later ft) if I or E rise by >20percent or if beta increases due to variant emergence. This cooperative, targeted phasing minimizes imported infections while keeping total mobility constant.'

By concentrating restrictions in weeks 1C3 (strict-first pattern), we reduce near-term seeding that would amplify under beta=0.128 and rapid progression (alpha1, delta0.628). Quantitative cooperation logic: expected imported infections per origin  Flow * ft * (I/pop + k*E/pop). Lowering ft in early weeks for high-prevalence origins reduces cumulative imported infections more than uniform reductions because infections compound over time. We shift conserved flow to later weeks (maintaining total Flow) to preserve mobility while buying time for case detection, contact tracing, vaccination or targeted interventions. Sensitivity reasoning: if prevalence or beta increases, early-week restrictions become more valuable (marginal benefit rises), so the policy should be tightened further front-loaded; if prevalence falls or detection improves (higher delta/gamma), the plan can relax earlier. Continued monitoring of origin E/I and Texas Q trends is essential to adapt week-by-week.'

Quantitatively, aggregate imported infectious pressure  _origin Flow_origin * _t ft,t * (I_origin / pop_origin) + contribution from E; reducing ft in early weeks for high-I origins cuts expected imported cases multiplicatively. Cooperative logic: shifting the time-profile of arrivals evens out importation risk to avoid simultaneous seeding events in Texas; delaying high-risk origin arrivals creates time to detect and respond to any small seeding and protects hospital capacity. Sensitivity reasoning: if origin prevalence (I or E) increases, the strict-first pattern yields larger marginal benefits  further reducing early ft reduces imports nonlinearly. If transmission rate beta in Texas rises, imported infectious individuals cause proportionally more secondary cases, increasing the value of early restrictions. Conversely, if origins prevalence drops faster than expected, later-week relaxation recovers mobility with limited epidemiological cost. These allocations are designed for adaptive updating: re-evaluate weekly using fresh prevalence and mobility data and reallocate remaining weeks to minimize cumulative cases and deaths.'

Collectively this reduces expected imported infectious arrivals because imported_infected_total_week_t  _origin Flow_origin * ft_origin_t * (I_origin / pop_origin). By pushing a larger share of Mississippi and Virginia flows into later weeks, the plan delays and reduces early seeding that would multiply through Texas's local transmission (beta), lowering cumulative cases and deaths. Quantitative cooperation logic: weeks with low ft across high-risk origins produce multiplicative reductions in downstream cases because fewer imported infections reduce secondary transmissions within Texas given R_eff  beta/(gamma+mu+delta) dynamics. We balance risk across weeks so no single week concentrates high-risk arrivals. Sensitivity reasoning: if source prevalence (I or E) is higher than reported or beta increases, early strictness should be intensified (reduce early ft); conversely, if prevalence falls or testing/quarantine efficacy increases, ft can be advanced. This allocation is robust: it concentrates restrictions where marginal benefit (import reduction per percent flow cut) is highest, while preserving mobility from low-risk origins. Continuous monitoring of source I/E, Texas hospital capacity, and sequencing data should guide week-to-week adjustments."

By concentrating restrictions when external I and E are highest, we reduce immediate imported infectious seeds that would drive local exponential growth in Texas. Quantitative cooperation logic: each origin's imported infections per week  Flow_orig * ft * (I_orig / pop_orig) + Flow_orig * ft * (E_orig / pop_orig) (exposed  infectious with incubation alpha). Shifting ft down in early weeks for high-prevalence states reduces the sum over origins of imported infected in critical early weeks, lowering expected cumulative Q and D in Texas. Risk balancing: large-volume but low-prevalence origins (New Mexico) are treated with relaxed-first to preserve mobility while keeping risk small per traveler; small-volume but high-prevalence origins are tightly limited. Sensitivity reasoning: if prevalence I or E increases in an origin, the marginal benefit of further reducing early ft there scales linearly with Flow*(d(I/pop))/dt and with beta (transmission). If beta is higher than estimated, stricter early controls become more valuable; if beta falls (via masks/vaccination), allocations can be relaxed earlier. Continuous monitoring and weekly reallocation are recommended to respond to prevalence changes and preserve the total 6-week flow budget."

By allocating low ft in weeks 1C3 for high-prevalence origins and shifting volumes to weeks 4C6, Texas reduces immediate imported infectious seeds when susceptible pools are large and transmission (beta0.128) can amplify introductions. Quantitative cooperation logic: each origins weekly imported infections scale roughly as Flow_origin * ft_week * (I_origin / pop_origin). By reducing ft early for high I/pop states, aggregate imported_infected over early weeks falls substantially; lower seeding now reduces downstream Q, R, and D in Texas because delta/gamma shape confirmation and recovery timing. We balance risk across weeks: defer non-urgent mobility from high-risk origins while allowing low-risk origins (new mexico) more early flow to preserve mobility. Sensitivity reasoning: results are sensitive to prevalence estimates (E and I) and transmission beta; if beta or I rise, stricter and longer front-loaded reductions are optimal. Conversely, if prevalence falls quickly, allocations can be relaxed earlier. Monitoring of rolling 7C14 day I/E and test positivity should trigger reweighting (move mass earlier if source improves or extend restrictions if it worsens).'
