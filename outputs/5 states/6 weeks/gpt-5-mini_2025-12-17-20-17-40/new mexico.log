Quantitative cooperation logic: imported_infected_week_t  sum_over_origins(Flow_origin * f_t_origin * (I_origin / pop_origin)). Shifting f_t downward early at high-risk origins reduces the weekly sum of introductions; later weeks are relaxed to honor total flow while leveraging improved local surveillance and case isolation to blunt later introductions. Sensitivity: if prevalence or beta rises, early strict-first allocations become even more valuable because import reductions prevent nonlinear growth; if prevalence falls or detection improves, allocations can be flattened (more even) to restore mobility. This plan balances epidemic control and socioeconomic cost by targeting timing and origin-specific risk rather than uniform flow cuts."

Because expected imported_infected  Flow * ft * (I/pop), reducing ft in early weeks for large Flow or large I/pop produces the largest immediate reductions in imported infections and thus fewer chains of local transmission and downstream confirmed/deaths. Quantitative cooperation logic: each origin keeps its total 6-week inbound volume constant, but concentrating restrictions early reduces the number of infectious introductions when local susceptible S in new mexico is high; later relaxation compensates to satisfy mobility needs. Sensitivity reasoning: results are most sensitive to prevalence (I/pop) and beta  if origin prevalence doubles or local beta rises, early-week strictness should be increased (reduce early ft further) because imported seeds translate into larger outbreaks. If alpha (incubation) shortens, imported E convert faster to I and early-week suppression becomes even more valuable. The chosen strict-first pattern balances epidemic risk reduction and later mobility compensation, minimizing expected cumulative confirmed and death counts while preserving total mobility quotas.'

Mississippi has the highest prevalence and so receives the strongest early restrictions (strict-first) to reduce immediate seeding risk. Texas, despite low prevalence, has very large daily flow; strict-first reduction in early weeks lowers absolute imported infections. Arizona and Virginia have low absolute risk; even allocation preserves mobility while keeping importation risk small. Quantitative cooperation logic: imported infectious persons  sum_over_origins _weeks (Flow_origin * ft_week * (I_origin / population_origin)). By reducing ft in early weeks for high-risk origins we cut the early integral of imported infections when local susceptibility is highest, reducing cumulative transmissions and deaths. Weeks 1C3 are weighted more heavily for control; weeks 4C6 gradually restore mobility to balance economic needs. Sensitivity reasoning: if prevalence (I or E) is underestimated or beta is higher, early strict-first reductions yield larger marginal benefits (nonlinear reduction in downstream cases). If local beta falls (better masking/vaccination), we can relax earlier. Conversely, if Texas or Mississippi prevalence rises, shift more allocation later (stronger front-loading) or reduce total inbound absolute flow via additional non-pharmaceutical interventions. Monitoring weekly surveillance to reallocate ft adaptively is recommended.'

Mississippi, with very high prevalence, receives the strictest early constraints to prevent many imported infections per traveler. Texas, by far the largest flow, also receives front-loaded restrictions: small early fractions avert many absolute imports because imported_infected scales with Flow*(I/pop). Arizona and Virginia are lower absolute risks so receive either even or modestly front-loaded allocations to balance mobility. Quantitative cooperation logic: redistributing each origin's fixed 6-week total toward later weeks reduces near-term imported infectious pressure when local outbreak growth is most sensitive; this buys time for testing, contact tracing, and vaccination/mitigation. The mathematical approximation used is imported_infected_week  Flow_origin * ft * (I_origin / pop_origin). Sensitivity reasoning: if prevalence (I or E) rises in any origin or effective beta increases, early-week strictness should be tightened further (lower ft) because imported infections grow linearly with Flow and prevalence and nonlinearly with local transmission (beta). Conversely, if origin prevalence falls or NM's containment improves (lower beta or higher detection delta), relaxations can be advanced. This plan balances epidemiological risk reduction and mobility by concentrating unavoidable flow later when NM can better absorb and manage potential imported cases."

Mississippi has the highest prevalence (I+E  20percent of its population) so we sharply restrict early weeks to prevent large influxes that would immediately amplify in New Mexico. Arizona and Texas both produce similar absolute daily imported infectious counts (~150C190/day if unrestricted) so they receive front-loaded restrictions to cut seeding when local transmission chains are most sensitive. Virginia's absolute import risk (~16/day) is low, so we allow more early mobility. Quantitative cooperation logic: the imported-infections contribution from each origin  Flow * ft * (I+E)/pop; lowering ft in early weeks yields fewer seeds when New Mexico's susceptible pool (S2.22M) is still large, reducing cumulative cases and deaths by preventing exponential local growth. We preserve total 6-week volume per origin (sum(ft)=1) to respect baselines while shifting timing to minimize risk. Sensitivity: results scale with prevalence and beta  if external prevalence or beta rises, the benefit of strict-first increases (early reductions avert more downstream cases). If prevalence drops or vaccination reduces beta, policy can relax earlier. Rapid changes in origin prevalence should trigger rebalancing toward stricter-week allocations for high-prevalence sources."

Quantitative cooperation logic: expected imported infections per origin  Flow * sum_t(f_t * I_origin / pop_origin). By minimizing f_t in early weeks for origin-states with either high I/pop or very large Flow, the aggregate imported infectious load into New Mexico over the risk window is reduced, lowering downstream confirmed cases and deaths given the SEIQRD transitions (E -> I via alpha, I -> Q via delta, Q -> R/D via gamma/mu). Risk-balancing across weeks staggers restrictions: strict-first for high-risk origins reduces near-term importation and buys time to expand testing, tracing, and local response; relaxed-first for lower-risk origins preserves essential mobility. Sensitivity reasoning: if prevalence or beta increases, early-week f_t must be reduced proportionally for high-Flow/high-prevalence origins to avoid multiplicative growth of imported seeds. Conversely, if effective vaccination or testing reduces I or lowers beta, fractions can be relaxed earlier. Continuous monitoring of origin I and E and adjusting weekly f_t (adaptive control) will maximize public-health benefits while minimizing socio-economic disruption.'
