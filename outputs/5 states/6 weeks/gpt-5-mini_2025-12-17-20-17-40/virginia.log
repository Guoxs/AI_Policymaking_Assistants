Given each origin's Flow is conserved over 6 weeks, redistributing weekly shares reduces near-term imported infectious pressure into Virginia when local vulnerability is greatest. Quantitative cooperation logic: imported infections scale approximately with Flow * (I/pop). By lowering f_t in early weeks for high (I/pop) states we reduce expected imported cases immediately (e.g., Mississippi contribution reduced most early), which reduces secondary transmission given Virginia's SEIQRD parameters (beta=0.19165, alpha=0.1636). Balancing across states: moderate-risk Arizona receives a mild strict-first profile; low-risk Texas is treated evenly to preserve essential mobility. Sensitivity reasoning: if prevalence (I/pop) in an origin increases, shift more mass to later weeks (stronger early restriction) to blunt immediate importation; if beta in Virginia rises, favor even stronger front-loading across all origins. If surveillance improves (faster delta/gamma), one can relax earlier weeks sooner. These allocations aim to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased by reducing short-term imported infections while balancing socioeconomic impacts."

The expected imported infections from state s in week t scale like Flow_s * f_{s,t} * ((I_s + 0.5*E_s)/Pop_s). Reducing f_{s,t} in early weeks for high-risk origins lowers cumulative introduced infections nonlinearly because early seeds can exponentially increase local transmission (beta* susceptible pool interactions). Quantitative cooperation logic: by assigning strict-first patterns to high absolute- or relative-risk origins and even patterns to low-risk origins, total imported infectious mass across weeks is reduced while preserving some mobility. Weeks with low f_t act as a buffer allowing Virginia's testing/tracing to detect and limit secondary spread before relaxing travel. Sensitivity reasoning: if prevalence or beta is higher than estimated, early strictness yields even greater marginal benefit (imported infections prevented per unit flow rises). Conversely, if prevalence is lower or detection improves quickly, later-week relaxations can be advanced. Continuous monitoring (weekly case data, positivity from inbound travelers) should be used to reweight f_t dynamically; the current plan is conservative for high-risk sources and balanced for low-risk sources to minimize cumulative cases and deaths."

Mississippi presents the highest prevalence (2.81percent) so concentrating strict controls early on that origin yields the largest marginal reduction in imported infectious persons per unit of flow reduction. Texas has a moderate prevalence but very large flow, so even modest early ft reductions yield substantial absolute importation reductions. Arizona and New Mexico contribute far fewer expected imports due to lower prevalence and/or lower flows; these origins can be eased earlier to preserve mobility. Quantitative cooperation logic: weekly allocations are balanced so that each origin's imported_infected_week_t  Flow_origin * ft_week * (I_origin / pop_origin) is minimized in early weeks for high-risk/high-flow origins and allowed to increase later, conserving total Flow over 6 weeks. This phased approach reduces near-term seeding while distributing unavoidable travel later when Virginia can detect and respond. Sensitivity reasoning: if origin prevalence or Virginia's beta were higher than estimated, stricter early ft reductions should be scaled up (lower f1Cf2). Conversely, if prevalence falls, relaxations can be advanced. The recommended policy is robust to moderate parameter uncertainty because it prioritizes early suppression for high-risk origins and shifts unavoidable travel to later weeks when local surveillance and case isolation can mitigate onward spread."

Quantitative cooperation logic: imported infections from origin j in week t  Flow_j * f_{j,t} * (I_j / Pop_j). By shifting mass of f_{j,t} later for high-prevalence origins we minimize early seeding when local Rt and susceptible pool risks are highest; lower early f_t yields multiplicative downstream reduction in cases and deaths given exponential dynamics. Risk-balancing across weeks: the plan front-loads mobility from low-risk origins, front-loads restrictions for high-risk origins, and staggers relaxations to preserve healthcare capacity. Sensitivity reasoning: if origin prevalence or beta increases, imported infections scale linearly with (I/Pop) and beta amplifies local transmission; this plan is conservative for such upswings because strict-first allocations concentrate restrictions when seeding consequences are largest. If prevalence falls faster than expected, relaxing later weeks recovers mobility with limited epidemiological cost. Monitoring triggers: reallocate f_t toward stricter values if I_j or beta rise >20percent week-over-week.'

By lowering f_t early for the largest per-capita-risk sources, Virginia reduces the number of imported infectious travelers at the time when local susceptibles are still abundant, which nonlinearly reduces secondary transmission and deaths. Quantitative cooperation logic: expected weekly imported infectious  sum_over_states(Flow_state * f_t_state * I_state / pop_state). Minimizing early-week f_t for high I/pop states yields the greatest marginal reduction in imported infections per unit of mobility constrained. Risk balancing across weeks: we conserve total inbound flow per state but shift it later when local controls, testing, vaccination coverage, or seasonal factors may reduce outbreak amplification risk. Sensitivity reasoning: if prevalence (I or E) in any origin increases, the model recommends stronger early-week suppression for that origin (reduce early f_t further). If transmissibility beta rises, the benefit of front-loading strict control increases (greater reduction in downstream cases), whereas if beta falls or test+isolation improves, allocations can be flattened to restore mobility sooner.'
