      "notes": "For Arizona, the risk interpretation based on SEIQRD values suggests a need for stricter control initially to limit the importation of infections. The quantitative logic indicates that imported infections are directly proportional to the flow and the infected population. Therefore, a strict-first pattern is chosen to minimize the initial impact of inbound cases. The trade-off between epidemic control and mobility is necessary to reduce the spread in Texas while balancing the need for interstate mobility. The validation confirms that the fractions sum to 1."
