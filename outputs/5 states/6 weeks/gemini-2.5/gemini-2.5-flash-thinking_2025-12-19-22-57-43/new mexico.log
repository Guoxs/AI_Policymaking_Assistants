Expected imported infections are proportional to `Flow * ft * (I/Population)`. Given Arizona's high flow, even moderate prevalence translates to a significant number of potential imported cases (estimated combined risk ~2.53 daily imported I if flow was uniform). A 'strict-first' allocation is chosen to front-load control, minimizing the immediate influx of potentially infected individuals. This proactive measure aims to protect New Mexico's currently low E/I counts from a rapid increase. This policy prioritizes epidemic control by initially restricting mobility. The gradual relaxation over 6 weeks provides a pathway to increased mobility, balancing health security with economic and social needs.

While its daily inbound flow to New Mexico is low (1862.67), the high individual risk from travelers is a concern. Expected imported infections are proportional to `Flow * ft * (I/Population)`. Despite lower total flow, Mississippi's high prevalence means each traveler poses a higher risk of being infected (estimated combined risk ~1.10 daily imported I if flow was uniform). A 'strict-first' allocation is implemented. This approach is critical to mitigate the risk posed by the higher prevalence, particularly in the initial weeks, ensuring that New Mexico's epidemic situation remains manageable. This strategy emphasizes epidemic control over immediate mobility from a high-prevalence area. The initial restriction helps to reduce the chance of importing highly infectious individuals, with a phased increase in mobility as the weeks progress.

This combination results in a significant absolute potential for imported cases, second only to Arizona. Expected imported infections are proportional to `Flow * ft * (I/Population)`. Despite the very low individual risk, the sheer volume of travelers means that the total number of imported infections could be substantial (estimated combined risk ~1.36 daily imported I if flow was uniform). A slightly 'relaxed-first' allocation is adopted. Given the extremely low prevalence, the individual risk is minimal, allowing for a more even distribution and slight relaxation over time to facilitate mobility while still managing the large flow. This policy balances the need to accommodate high mobility from a major neighboring state with the low but non-zero risk of importing infections.

This combination results in the lowest overall absolute risk of imported infections. Expected imported infections are proportional to `Flow * ft * (I/Population)`. The very low flow means that even with moderate prevalence, the total number of imported cases will be small (estimated combined risk ~0.44 daily imported I if flow was uniform). An 'even' allocation is chosen. Due to the very low total flow and relatively small impact on New Mexico's epidemic trajectory, an even distribution provides predictable and stable mobility without significant epidemiological risk. This approach prioritizes mobility stability and predictability given the minimal impact on New Mexico's epidemic control efforts. The low volume of traffic allows for a less stringent, more balanced approach to flow management. The sum of fractions is 0.166667 + 0.166667 + 0.166667 + 0.166667 + 0.166666 + 0.166666 = 1.000000."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound allocation policies collectively aim to minimize New Mexico's cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically managing imported infection risks from diverse origin states. For states posing higher immediate threats！either due to high prevalence (Mississippi) or a combination of moderate prevalence and high volume (Arizona)！a 'strict-first' approach is adopted. This front-loads control to reduce the initial surge of potential infections, safeguarding New Mexico's current low E and I counts. Conversely, for Texas, despite its massive inbound flow, its exceptionally low prevalence allows for a slightly 'relaxed-first' approach, acknowledging the minimal individual risk while facilitating essential mobility. Virginia, with its low flow and moderate prevalence, receives an 'even' allocation, as its overall contribution to imported infections is negligible, prioritizing stability. This differentiated strategy ensures that resources are concentrated on mitigating the most impactful risks, while maintaining reasonable mobility where epidemiological risk is lower.\n\nThe risk balancing across weeks and states is based on a quantitative assessment of 'combined risk' (Flow * I/Population).

By distributing the total 6-week flow non-uniformly, we effectively reduce the exposure during critical early phases, when New Mexico's population is most susceptible. The 'strict-first' patterns for Arizona and Mississippi mean that a larger proportion of their total 6-week flow is deferred to later weeks, thereby reducing the average daily imported infections in weeks 1-3. Conversely, Texas's 'relaxed-first' pattern, despite its high flow, is justified by its extremely low prevalence, implying fewer actual infected individuals per unit of flow. This cooperation logic ensures that the overall burden of imported infections is smoothed out and minimized, preventing overwhelming the local healthcare system and allowing New Mexico's internal epidemic dynamics (R0=1.1) to stabilize without external shocks.\n\nThe effectiveness of these policies is sensitive to several factors. If the actual prevalence (I/Population) in origin states is significantly higher than the 21-day average, particularly in weeks 1-3, the 'strict-first' policies would be even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence drops faster than anticipated, the strict-first approach might be overly restrictive. Changes in New Mexico's internal epidemic parameters (e.g., a higher beta or lower gamma) would make the state more vulnerable, necessitating even stricter controls across all origin states. The policy is also sensitive to the accuracy of flow predictions; significant deviations from the ground truth 42-day average flow would alter the absolute number of imported cases, requiring re-evaluation. Continuous monitoring of SEIQRD data in origin states and New Mexico is crucial for adaptive policy adjustments."

Quantitative logic: Expected imported infections are proportional to Flow * ft * (I_texas + E_texas) / Population_texas.

This differentiated approach ensures that the most potent threats are addressed immediately, while less critical flows are managed sustainably. The total inbound flow from each state over 6 weeks is fixed by the ground truth, meaning the policy is about temporal risk management. By front-loading restrictions on high-prevalence states, the expected number of imported E/I individuals in early weeks is significantly reduced.

This strategy effectively balances the disruption to mobility across the weeks, ensuring that the most impactful interventions are applied when the risk is highest, and gradually eased when the immediate threat is mitigated. The effectiveness of these policies is highly sensitive to the underlying epidemiological parameters and current conditions. If the prevalence (I+E)/Population in any origin state were to sharply increase, a more aggressive 'strict-first' stance would be warranted, potentially requiring even lower initial fractions.

Similarly, if New Mexico's own E/I population were to surge, its capacity to absorb any imported cases would diminish, demanding a review of all inbound traffic policies towards stricter measures.
