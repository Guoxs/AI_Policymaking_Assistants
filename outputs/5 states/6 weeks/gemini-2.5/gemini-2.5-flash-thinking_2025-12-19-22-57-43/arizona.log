    "notes": "Risk interpretation: Mississippi has a relatively high `I/Population` (0.00059), which is significantly higher than Arizona's (0.000132). This indicates a notable risk of importing infected individuals, despite its lower total inbound flow compared to other states. Quantitative logic: Expected imported infections from Mississippi can be estimated as `Flow * ft * (I_mississippi / Population_mississippi)`. By keeping `ft` lower in earlier weeks, we aim to reduce the initial influx of potentially infected individuals. Pattern: A 'strict-first, then gradually relaxed' pattern is chosen. This means lower flow in the initial weeks (f1, f2) to mitigate immediate risk, followed by a gradual increase in subsequent weeks. This strategy allows Arizona to manage its existing cases and avoid a rapid increase from external sources. Trade-offs: This approach prioritizes epidemic control by limiting early mobility from a higher-prevalence state. The trade-off is a temporary reduction in economic and social mobility from Mississippi, which is gradually eased as the weeks progress, balancing control with eventual normalization. Validation: The fractions [0.1, 0.15, 0.15, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2] sum to 1.0."

  "new mexico": {
    "fractions": [0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.25],
    "notes": "Risk interpretation: New Mexico presents the highest risk due to both a high `I/Population` (0.00061, highest among origin states and significantly above Arizona's 0.000132) and a substantial daily inbound flow (27336.1). This combination significantly increases the potential for importing a large number of infected individuals. Quantitative logic: The number of imported infected individuals is directly proportional to `Flow * ft * (I_new_mexico / Population_new_mexico)`. Given the high base flow and prevalence, early restriction (`ft` values) is critical to curb potential imported cases. Pattern: A very 'strict-first, gradually relaxed' pattern is implemented. The lowest fractions are assigned to the initial weeks to drastically reduce early import risk, with a cautious increase over time, assuming Arizona's internal situation and New Mexico's prevalence do not worsen. Trade-offs: This policy heavily prioritizes epidemic control by severely limiting early mobility from a high-risk source. The trade-off is a significant short-term impact on cross-border travel and economic activities between New Mexico and Arizona, justified by the imperative to protect Arizona's public health. Validation: The fractions [0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.25] sum to 1.0."

    "notes": "Risk interpretation: Texas has a remarkably low `I/Population` (0.000011), significantly lower than Arizona's (0.000132). This suggests a very low individual risk of importing an infected person. However, Texas also has the highest daily inbound flow (34142.76), meaning that even a low prevalence can result in a non-negligible number of imported cases over time. Quantitative logic: Imported infections are calculated as `Flow * ft * (I_texas / Population_texas)`. Despite the low `I/Population`, the high total flow necessitates careful management. Pattern: An 'even' distribution pattern is chosen. This is because the low prevalence reduces the urgency for strict early controls. An even distribution allows for consistent mobility while still managing the cumulative impact from the high volume over the 6-week period. Trade-offs: This policy balances maintaining consistent mobility, given the low individual risk, with the need to prevent cumulative imported cases from high volume. It avoids overly stringent measures where the per-capita risk is low, supporting economic and social ties. Validation: The fractions [0.166667, 0.166667, 0.166667, 0.166667, 0.166666, 0.166666] sum to 1.0."

This places it at a moderate risk level for importing infections into Arizona. Quantitative logic: The number of imported infected individuals can be estimated using `Flow * ft * (I_virginia / Population_virginia)`. A cautious approach is warranted to manage this moderate but significant risk. Pattern: A 'strict-first, gradually relaxed' pattern is adopted. This strategy aims to reduce the initial infection pressure by limiting early week flow, allowing Arizona more time to manage its internal epidemic situation before increasing inbound traffic from Virginia. Trade-offs: This policy prioritizes early epidemic control to prevent a surge in cases while acknowledging the need for eventual relaxation of mobility restrictions. It balances public health concerns with the desire to facilitate travel and economic activity over the medium term. Validation: The fractions [0.12, 0.15, 0.18, 0.18, 0.18, 0.19] sum to 1.0."

  "global_guidance": "The collective strategy aims to minimize imported infections and deaths in Arizona by differentially managing inbound traffic based on the origin state's current epidemiological risk (I/Population) and the volume of traffic. States with higher `I/Population` (New Mexico, Mississippi, Virginia) are subjected to stricter early-week controls ('strict-first') to prevent an immediate surge of new cases into Arizona, which currently has ongoing transmission (E=1952, I=962). This front-loads epidemic control, allowing Arizona's healthcare system to better manage existing cases and potentially reduce its own `E` and `I` counts. For states with very low `I/Population` but high volume (Texas), an 'even' distribution is chosen, as the individual risk is low, but the cumulative impact of high flow needs consistent management. This differentiated approach tailors the response to specific threats, optimizing resource allocation and minimizing overall disease burden.\n\nThe quantitative cooperation logic revolves around the principle of `imported_infected = total_flow * ft * (I/Population)`. By assigning lower `ft` values in earlier weeks for high-prevalence states, we effectively reduce the number of `imported_infected` when Arizona is most vulnerable (i.e., at the beginning of the 6-week period). As weeks progress, `ft` values are gradually increased, assuming Arizona's internal situation stabilizes and the origin states' prevalence does not drastically worsen. This temporal staggering of inflow prevents a concentrated spike in imported cases, distributing the risk over time. The sum of `ft` for each state is maintained at 1, ensuring that the total ground truth flow over 6 weeks is preserved, balancing epidemic control with the need to maintain overall mobility.\n\nSensitivity reasoning: If an origin state's `I/Population` were to significantly increase (e.g., a new outbreak), the `strict-first` fractions for that state would need to be re-evaluated and potentially made even more stringent, especially in early weeks, to mitigate the heightened risk. Conversely, if an origin state's `I/Population` drastically decreased, the policy could shift towards a more 'relaxed-first' or 'even' distribution to support mobility, provided Arizona's internal situation also allows. If Arizona's `beta` (0.111577643) were higher, Arizona would be more susceptible to rapid spread from imported cases, necessitating lower `ft` values across all origin states. If the ground truth inflow for an origin state were to increase, even with the same `I/Population`, the absolute number of potential imported infections would rise, requiring a review of the `ft` fractions, likely leading to lower values or a more aggressive 'strict-first' approach to keep imported infection counts manageable."

This indicates a high potential for imported infections, estimated as Flow * ft * (I/Population). To minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Arizona, a 'strict-first' pattern is adopted. This means restricting inbound flow in the initial weeks (lower ft values) when Arizona's own Exposed population (E=7078) is substantial and could rapidly spread new imported infections. Early control helps flatten the curve and allows Arizona's internal epidemic to progress without significant external pressure. The trade-off is reduced immediate mobility for enhanced long-term public health. Mobility is gradually relaxed in later weeks, maintaining the total required flow.

The potential for imported infections (Flow * ft * (I/Population)) from New Mexico is therefore minimal per traveler. Given this low risk, an 'even' distribution pattern is recommended across the 6 weeks. This maintains a steady flow of mobility without significant fluctuations, which can be beneficial for economic stability and predictable travel. Since New Mexico's infection pressure is low, there is less need for stringent early restrictions. The trade-off is minimal, as epidemic control is not heavily compromised by this steady flow.

  "global_guidance": "The overarching strategy for Arizona is to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by carefully managing imported infections. This is achieved through a differentiated approach based on each origin state's infection pressure (I/Population) and baseline inbound flow. High-risk states like Mississippi and Virginia, with elevated I/Population ratios, are subjected to a 'strict-first' policy, meaning lower inbound flow in the initial weeks. This proactive measure aims to reduce the immediate external seeding of the virus, especially crucial given Arizona's current significant Exposed (E) population. Texas, despite a moderate I/Population, receives a similar 'strict-first' approach due to its exceptionally high baseline flow, which translates to a high number of potential imported cases. Conversely, New Mexico, with the lowest I/Population, is allocated an 'even' flow distribution, as its contribution to imported risk is minimal. This quantitative cooperation logic balances the risk across weeks and states. By front-loading restrictions for higher-risk sources, Arizona gains valuable time to manage its internal epidemic dynamics, allowing its own E population to either recover or progress through the disease stages without being overwhelmed by new external introductions. The later relaxation of controls ensures the total mobility quotas are met, balancing public health with economic and social needs. The policy's effectiveness is sensitive to changes in origin state prevalence; an unexpected surge in cases in a low-risk state would necessitate a re-evaluation of its allocation. Similarly, variations in Arizona's internal infection parameters (beta, gamma) would alter its capacity to absorb imported cases, potentially requiring more stringent or relaxed overall controls."
