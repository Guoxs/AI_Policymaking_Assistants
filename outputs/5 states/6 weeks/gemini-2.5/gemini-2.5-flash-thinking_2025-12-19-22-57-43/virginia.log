    "notes": "Arizona's average Infected-to-Population (I/Pop) ratio of 0.0001321 is lower than Virginia's current prevalence of 0.0003736. This indicates a comparatively lower risk of introducing infections from Arizona's inbound traffic. The E and Q values are moderate, suggesting some active cases but not at a concerning level relative to Virginia. The expected number of imported infected individuals from Arizona is approximated by `Daily_Flow * ft * (I_arizona / Pop_arizona)`. Given its lower prevalence, the per-traveler risk is less acute. An 'even' distribution pattern is recommended, maintaining consistent mobility and associated risk over the six weeks. This approach is chosen because Arizona's infection prevalence is lower than Virginia's, thus there is no strong epidemiological justification for disproportionate restrictions. This policy balances stable mobility with consistent epidemic control. The fractions sum to 0.1666 + 0.1667 + 0.1667 + 0.1667 + 0.1667 + 0.1666 = 1.0000, ensuring the total inbound flow over the period remains constant."

    "notes": "Mississippi has a relatively high average Infected-to-Population (I/Pop) ratio of 0.0005890, which is significantly higher than Virginia's current prevalence of 0.0003736. This indicates a higher risk of importing infected individuals per traveler. The notable E and Q numbers further suggest ongoing transmission. The expected number of imported infected individuals from Mississippi is approximated by `Daily_Flow * ft * (I_mississippi / Pop_mississippi)`. With a high I/Pop ratio, even moderate flow can contribute substantially to Virginia's case count. A 'strict-first' pattern is recommended. This aims to limit the initial influx of potentially infected individuals during the early weeks, which is crucial for minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by mitigating the risk of accelerating local transmission. This approach prioritizes epidemic control by front-loading restrictions, with a trade-off of temporarily reduced mobility that is balanced by increased mobility in later weeks, keeping the total flow constant. The fractions sum to 0.18 + 0.175 + 0.17 + 0.165 + 0.16 + 0.15 = 1.00, ensuring the total inbound flow over 6 weeks remains consistent with the baseline."

  "new mexico": {
    "fractions": [0.18, 0.175, 0.17, 0.165, 0.16, 0.15],
    "notes": "New Mexico exhibits the highest average Infected-to-Population (I/Pop) ratio of 0.0006085 among all origin states, considerably higher than Virginia's current prevalence of 0.0003736. Despite having the lowest baseline daily inflow to Virginia, its high prevalence means each traveler from New Mexico poses a significant infection risk. The E and Q values also suggest active cases. The expected number of imported infected individuals is approximately `Daily_Flow * ft * (I_new_mexico / Pop_new_mexico)`. The high I/Pop ratio makes this state a high-risk source for new introductions. A 'strict-first' pattern is applied to reduce the immediate risk of introducing infections, providing Virginia with more time to manage its internal epidemic situation. This early restriction is critical for minimizing cumulative cases. While this approach prioritizes epidemic control by limiting early high-risk introductions, it temporarily reduces mobility from New Mexico; however, the total allocated flow for the 6 weeks remains constant, balancing control with overall connectivity. The sum of fractions is 0.18 + 0.175 + 0.17 + 0.165 + 0.16 + 0.15 = 1.00, confirming adherence to the total flow constraint."

    "fractions": [0.1666, 0.1667, 0.1667, 0.1667, 0.1667, 0.1666],
    "notes": "Texas shows a very low average Infected-to-Population (I/Pop) ratio of 0.0000113, which is substantially lower than Virginia's current prevalence of 0.0003736. Despite having the highest baseline daily inflow to Virginia, the extremely low prevalence means the per-traveler infection risk is minimal. The expected number of imported infected individuals is approximately `Daily_Flow * ft * (I_texas / Pop_texas)`. Due to the very low I/Pop ratio, even with high total flow, the absolute number of imported infected cases is projected to be low, making it the least risky origin state. An 'even' distribution pattern is chosen. Given the minimal risk of infection importation from Texas, an even distribution allows for maximum mobility benefits while maintaining a negligible epidemiological risk throughout the six-week period. This policy strongly prioritizes mobility, minimizing disruption to travel and commerce, with a negligible trade-off in terms of epidemic control. The fractions sum to 0.1666 + 0.1667 + 0.1667 + 0.1667 + 0.1667 + 0.1666 = 1.0000, ensuring the total inbound flow over 6 weeks is maintained."

  "global_guidance": "This mobility policy for Virginia strategically manages inbound traffic over the next six weeks to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases, while acknowledging the importance of mobility. The core strategy differentiates policies based on the relative infection risk posed by each origin state, primarily quantified by their average Infected-to-Population (I/Pop) ratio compared to Virginia's current prevalence (0.0003736). For high-risk states like Mississippi (I/Pop: 0.0005890) and New Mexico (I/Pop: 0.0006085), which have a higher prevalence than Virginia, a 'strict-first' approach is implemented. By front-loading traffic restrictions (lower 'ft' values in early weeks), we aim to reduce the immediate introduction of infections. This early intervention is crucial for minimizing cumulative cases by preventing initial spikes that could overwhelm healthcare resources or accelerate local transmission, especially given Virginia's current SEIRD parameters. This approach balances the need for epidemic control with maintaining overall mobility by allowing for increased flow in later weeks, assuming Virginia's internal situation stabilizes or the origin state's risk profile improves. Conversely, for lower-risk states such as Arizona (I/Pop: 0.0001321) and Texas (I/Pop: 0.0000113), which have significantly lower prevalence than Virginia, an 'even' distribution of traffic across the six weeks is adopted. This approach recognizes that the risk of importing new infections from these states is comparatively low. An even distribution prioritizes stable mobility and economic activity without posing a substantial additional epidemiological burden. The quantitative cooperation logic dictates that resources for epidemic control are best focused on higher-risk inflows, allowing for more relaxed, consistent policies where the risk is minimal. This collective strategy ensures that the overall expected imported infections into Virginia are managed effectively, preventing large influxes from high-prevalence areas while maintaining necessary travel from low-prevalence regions. The effectiveness of these policies is sensitive to changes in prevalence (I/Pop) in both Virginia and the origin states, as well as Virginia's 'beta' value. If an origin state's I/Pop were to significantly increase, its assigned 'strict-first' fractions might need to be intensified or extended. Conversely, if Virginia's own 'beta' (infection rate) were to increase, indicating a more volatile internal epidemic, a more universally strict approach across all origin states might be warranted, or the 'strict-first' periods for high-risk states might need to be prolonged. Continuous monitoring of SEIQRD parameters in all states is essential for adaptive policy adjustments."
