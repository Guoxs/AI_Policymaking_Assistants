This translates to an estimated 0.589 potential E+I individuals per day if flow is unrestricted. 2. Quantitative logic: The expected number of imported infected/exposed individuals is proportional to Flow * ft * (E+I)/Population. Given Arizona's relatively lower absolute imported infection risk compared to other states, a slightly strict-first approach is adopted, but with a more gradual increase in flow than higher-risk states. 3. Pattern choice: A slightly strict-first pattern is chosen to align with the overall objective of minimizing early infections, with weekly fractions gradually increasing. This allows for early caution while gradually relaxing as the weeks progress. 4. Trade-offs: This policy balances epidemic control with mobility by maintaining a consistent, albeit slightly increasing, flow. The impact on mobility is moderate, reflecting the moderate risk. 5.

This results in an estimated 1.233 potential E+I individuals per day if flow is unrestricted, ranking it as the second-highest absolute risk. 2. Quantitative logic: The expected imported infections are directly influenced by Flow * ft * (E+I)/Population. Due to New Mexico's high prevalence, even with a moderate flow, the risk of importing cases is significant. 3.

This high volume results in an estimated 1.089 potential E+I individuals per day if flow is unrestricted, placing it as the third-highest absolute risk. 2.

While not as aggressive as the highest-risk states, early weeks have slightly lower fractions to mitigate the impact of high traffic volume, followed by a gradual increase. 4.

States with the highest absolute potential for imported infections (Texas and Virginia) are subjected to the most stringent early controls (strong strict-first pattern). Arizona, with moderate absolute risk, receives a moderate strict-first approach. New Mexico, posing the lowest absolute risk, has a policy closer to even distribution, reflecting a lower perceived threat. This differentiated approach ensures that states contributing most to the imported infection burden are targeted most aggressively, while allowing for relatively more consistent flow from lower-risk origins. The aim is to flatten the curve of imported cases, preventing an overwhelmed healthcare system in Mississippi. The core principle is that Cumulative_Imported_Cases = Sum_over_states_and_weeks [Flow_state * ft_week * (E_state + I_state) / Pop_state]. By applying strict-first policies to higher-risk states, we effectively shift a larger proportion of their allowed total flow to later weeks. This reduces the immediate infection pressure on Mississippi, allowing more time for its internal epidemic to potentially subside or for public health measures to take effect. The 'ft' values are chosen to create a decreasing curve for higher-risk states, ensuring that the highest proportion of traffic (and thus potential infections) is deferred. For example, Texas, with the highest product of flow and prevalence, sees 25% of its total 6-week flow in week 1, while New Mexico, with the lowest product, sees 18%. This strategic allocation balances the risk from different origins across the 6-week horizon, optimizing for the lowest cumulative imported infections. The effectiveness of these policies is sensitive to several factors. If the prevalence ((E+I)/Pop) in an origin state were to suddenly increase or decrease significantly, the risk assessment would need immediate revision. For instance, a sharp rise in Texas's prevalence would necessitate even stricter and prolonged controls. Similarly, if Mississippi's internal beta (infection rate) or gamma (recovery rate) were to change, its capacity to absorb imported cases would shift. A higher beta in Mississippi would make early imported cases even more detrimental, reinforcing the strict-first approach. Conversely, a rapidly declining beta or increasing gamma within Mississippi might allow for a quicker relaxation of controls across all states. The current policy assumes a relatively stable epidemiological situation within the origin states over the 6-week period and a continued high internal infection rate in Mississippi, thus favoring early, strong mitigation from higher-risk sources."
