The 'E' (Exposed) population is also relatively low. Expected imported infections are proportional to 'Flow * ft * (I/Population)'. Given Arizona's lower prevalence, the impact of each unit of flow is less. A slightly strict-first pattern is adopted, with fractions [0.15, 0.16, 0.17, 0.17, 0.175, 0.175]. While Arizona is low-risk, a cautious approach is still prudent to delay some potential influx, aligning with the overall goal of minimizing cumulative cases. This also allows for potential monitoring of the situation. This pattern slightly restricts early mobility from Arizona but opens up more in later weeks, balancing immediate public health concerns with future interaction needs.

Its 'E' population also contributes to potential future infections. The potential for importing infected individuals is higher due to Mississippi's elevated 'I' prevalence. Lower 'ft' values in early weeks are critical to mitigate initial infection pressure on Texas. A 'strict-first' pattern [0.10, 0.14, 0.16, 0.18, 0.20, 0.22] is chosen. This strategy aims to delay a significant portion of inbound traffic from Mississippi until later weeks, reducing the immediate risk of disease introduction when Texas's own 'I' population is relatively low. This buys time for Texas to manage its internal situation. Early week mobility from Mississippi is constrained, which could impact economic activities. However, this is a necessary trade-off to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Texas by limiting the early influx of infections. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000."

Its 'E' population is also high relative to its total population. Given its high 'I' prevalence, New Mexico has the highest potential for contributing to imported infections (proportional to 'Flow * ft * (I/Population)'). Aggressively low 'ft' values in early weeks are crucial. A strong 'strict-first' pattern [0.08, 0.12, 0.15, 0.20, 0.22, 0.23] is implemented. This heavily front-loads control, significantly reducing inbound flow in the initial weeks. This strategy is designed to minimize the immediate and cumulative impact of imported cases from the highest-risk source, allowing Texas more time to prepare or for New Mexico's situation to improve. This policy imposes the most severe initial restrictions on mobility from New Mexico, potentially affecting cross-border activities.

The expected number of imported infections from Virginia is moderate. Adjusting 'ft' values allows for a balanced approach to manage this risk without overly stringent initial controls. A 'moderate strict-first' pattern [0.12, 0.15, 0.17, 0.18, 0.19, 0.19] is chosen. This gradually increases flow over the 6 weeks, providing a buffer in the early stages while acknowledging Virginia's intermediate risk level. This pattern helps to smooth out the potential imported infection load. This approach balances the need for epidemic control with maintaining a more consistent, albeit gradually increasing, level of mobility compared to the highest-risk states. It seeks to mitigate risk without imposing the most severe initial economic disruptions. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "The collective strategy aims to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Texas by strategically distributing inbound traffic over the next six weeks based on the origin states' current infection prevalence. States with higher 'I' (Infected) prevalence, such as New Mexico and Mississippi, are subjected to stricter controls in the initial weeks (lower 'ft' values). This 'strict-first' approach delays the potential influx of a larger number of infected individuals, preventing an overwhelming surge in Texas's healthcare system and allowing more time for potential internal epidemic management or for the origin state's situation to improve. Conversely, states with lower 'I' prevalence, like Arizona, face less stringent initial restrictions, providing a more consistent, albeit still cautious, flow of mobility. Virginia, with moderate risk, follows a balanced, gradually increasing flow. This differentiated approach ensures that the highest infection pressures are mitigated early, while overall mobility is managed.\n\nThe policy modulates the total imported infection risk ('imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/Population)') across states and over time. By implementing a 'strict-first' pattern for high-risk states, the policy effectively reduces the 'Flow * ft' component when 'I/Population' is high, thus lowering the expected number of imported cases in the critical early weeks. For example, New Mexico's '(I/Population)' is highest, so its 'f1' is the lowest (0.08), significantly reducing its initial contribution to imported infections despite its high total flow. This coordinated adjustment of 'ft' values across all origin states aims to smooth out the aggregate inflow of potential infections into Texas, preventing large spikes that could strain local resources. The goal is not to eliminate imported cases (as total flow is constant) but to manage their temporal distribution to minimize cumulative impact.\n\nThe effectiveness of this policy is sensitive to several factors. If the actual 'I' prevalence in origin states is significantly higher or lower than the 21-day averages provided, the risk assessment and thus the 'ft' allocations might be suboptimal. For instance, a sudden surge in 'I' in a currently low-risk state would necessitate a rapid policy adjustment. Similarly, changes in Texas's own 'beta' (infection rate) or 'alpha' (progression to confirmed) parameters would alter its capacity to absorb imported infections. A higher 'beta' in Texas would demand even stricter early controls across all states. The policy assumes a relatively stable or gradually improving situation in origin states over the 6-week period, which might not hold true. Regular re-evaluation of origin state SEIQRD data and Texas's internal epidemic status is crucial for adapting these mobility policies."

While not as high as Mississippi, its significant population size means even a moderate prevalence warrants careful management to prevent imported cases. The current 'I' count is relatively low, but 'E' is higher, indicating potential future infections. 2. **Quantitative logic**: The expected number of imported infected individuals from Arizona is estimated by `Total_Flow * ft * ((I+E)/Population_arizona)`.

This distributes the flow with slightly lower proportions in early weeks (f1, f2) and gradually increases them. This strategy aims to reduce initial infection imports into Texas while allowing for increased mobility later. 4. **Trade-offs**: This policy balances the need for early epidemic control with the desire to maintain reasonable mobility, acknowledging Arizona's lower, but still present, risk.

This indicates a substantial number of active and incubating cases, posing a high risk of importing infected individuals into Texas. 2. **Quantitative logic**: The expected number of imported infected individuals from Mississippi is approximated by `Total_Flow * ft * ((I+E)/Population_mississippi)`. To minimize this, especially in the early weeks, `ft` values are kept exceptionally low. 3. **Pattern choice**: A 'strict-first' traffic allocation pattern is chosen. This means inbound flow is severely restricted in the initial weeks (f1, f2) and gradually relaxed in later weeks (f5, f6). This strategy aims to minimize the introduction of new infections into Texas when its susceptible population is high and its own infection numbers are low, thereby mitigating early exponential growth. 4. **Trade-offs**: This policy prioritizes public health by severely limiting early mobility from a high-risk state, which may impact economic activity. However, relaxing restrictions in later weeks allows for a gradual return to normal mobility once Texas's internal epidemic situation or immunity levels may have adjusted. 5. **Validation**: The fractions [0.050, 0.100, 0.150, 0.200, 0.250, 0.250] sum precisely to 1.000."

Given its low prevalence, a less aggressive restriction is warranted, while still prioritizing early control. 3. **Pattern choice**: A "cautiously balanced" traffic allocation pattern is chosen.

  "global_guidance": "The overarching strategy is to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Texas by strategically managing inbound traffic from various origin states. This is achieved by implementing a differentiated 'strict-first' approach, where states with higher infection prevalence (specifically I and E populations relative to their total population) face more stringent early-week restrictions. Mississippi, identified as the highest risk state, receives the most severe early limitations, while New Mexico, with the lowest risk, sees a more balanced but still cautiously managed flow. This cross-state reasoning ensures that the total inbound flow, while constant over six weeks for each state as per the ground truth, is distributed in a manner that reduces the initial surge of imported infections. The quantitative cooperation logic dictates that by front-loading restrictions, the exponential spread of the disease within Texas is mitigated, as early imported cases have a disproportionately larger impact on cumulative figures. This approach balances the need for mobility with the critical objective of public health protection. This policy's sensitivity lies in the dynamic nature of epidemics. Should the prevalence of infection in any origin state change significantly, or if Texas's internal epidemic parameters (like its effective reproduction number, R_t, derived from beta) shift, the optimal distribution of these weekly fractions would need re-evaluation. For example, a sudden spike in cases in a currently low-risk state would necessitate a more restrictive stance for that state, while improved control in a high-risk state could allow for earlier relaxation.
