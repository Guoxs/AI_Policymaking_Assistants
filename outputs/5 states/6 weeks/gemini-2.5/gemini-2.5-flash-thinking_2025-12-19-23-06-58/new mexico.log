This 'strict-first' pattern for high-risk states is critical for protecting New Mexico's currently susceptible population (S=2093484) from an early surge of imported infections. Conversely, states posing a lower infection pressure (e.g., Virginia) are managed with slightly more relaxed initial or evenly distributed controls, allowing for a balanced approach to mobility.

Such risk balancing is crucial for maintaining a manageable epidemic trajectory within the state. The sensitivity of these policies is significant: should the infectious prevalence in high-flow states like Texas unexpectedly increase, the current 'strict-first' measures would require immediate tightening or extension. Similarly, if New Mexico's internal reproductive number (driven by `beta`) were to rise, a more universally restrictive inbound policy would become imperative. Conversely, improved detection or recovery rates (`delta`, `gamma`) in New Mexico could allow for a gradual relaxation of these inbound controls."

Its Infected Prevalence (I/Pop) is 0.00004715, which is the lowest among all origin states, indicating a relatively low per-traveler risk. The E count suggests potential future infections, but its current I is low. 2. **Quantitative logic**: The expected imported infections from Arizona into New Mexico are proportional to its daily inbound flow, the weekly fraction (ft), and Arizona's Infected Prevalence (I/Pop). Given Arizona's low I/Pop, its contribution to imported infections per traveler is minimal compared to other states. 3. **Pattern choice**: An 'even' distribution pattern for inbound traffic (0.166667 for the first four weeks, 0.166666 for the last two) is chosen. This strategy spreads the fixed total inbound flow uniformly across the 6 weeks. This approach avoids concentrating mobility or infection risk in any specific week, assuming Arizona's average risk profile persists. 4. **Trade-offs**: While a low-risk state like Arizona might justify a more relaxed approach, maintaining an even distribution provides consistency and predictability.

Its Infected Prevalence (I/Pop) is 0.00160950, which is significantly the highest among all origin states. This indicates a very high per-traveler risk of importing infections. The high E count further suggests a sustained potential for new infections. 2. **Quantitative logic**: Expected imported infections from Mississippi are directly proportional to its daily inbound flow, the weekly fraction (ft), and its very high Infected Prevalence (I/Pop). Due to this high prevalence, even a small proportion of flow can contribute significantly to New Mexico's imported case count. 3. **Pattern choice**: An 'even' distribution pattern for inbound traffic (0.166667 for the first four weeks, 0.166666 for the last two) is adopted. Despite Mississippi's high risk, the constraint of a fixed total inbound flow over 6 weeks necessitates distributing this inherent risk uniformly across the period. This prevents any single week from bearing a disproportionately high influx of potentially infected individuals. 4. **Trade-offs**: Given Mississippi's high infection pressure, a 'strict-first' approach might seem intuitive. However, since the total flow cannot be reduced, such an approach would merely shift risk to later weeks. An even distribution aims to consistently manage this high-level risk without creating new vulnerabilities in future weeks, balancing epidemic control with consistent mobility. 5. **Validation**: The sum of the six fractions is 1.000000."

Its E count is relatively low, suggesting a stable infection rate. 2. **Quantitative logic**: The expected imported infections from Texas are proportional to its daily inbound flow, the weekly fraction (ft), and its Infected Prevalence (I/Pop). While its total 'I' count is high, its large population dilutes the per-traveler risk. 3. **Pattern choice**: An 'even' distribution pattern for inbound traffic (0.166667 for the first four weeks, 0.166666 for the last two) is chosen. This strategy ensures that the considerable total inbound flow from Texas, combined with its moderate infection prevalence, is spread consistently across the 6-week period. This prevents any single week from experiencing an undue concentration of imported risk. 4. **Trade-offs**: Texas represents a significant portion of New Mexico's inbound traffic.

Its Infected Prevalence (I/Pop) is 0.00018222, placing it as the second highest risk state after Mississippi. The substantial E count indicates a considerable pool of future infections. 2. **Quantitative logic**: The expected imported infections from Virginia are proportional to its daily inbound flow, the weekly fraction (ft), and its Infected Prevalence (I/Pop). Virginia's relatively high I/Pop means each traveler carries a higher potential risk of infection than those from Arizona or Texas. 3. **Pattern choice**: An 'even' distribution pattern for inbound traffic (0.166667 for the first four weeks, 0.166666 for the last two) is implemented. This strategy uniformly spreads the imported infection risk over the 6 weeks. This approach is preferred due to the lack of specific trend data for Virginia's SEIQRD values, aiming to avoid peaks in imported cases. 4. **Trade-offs**: Given Virginia's moderate-to-high infection prevalence, maintaining an even flow distribution helps New Mexico manage a consistent level of imported risk.

  "global_guidance": "1. **Cross-state reasoning**: The recommended policy applies a uniform 'even' distribution of inbound traffic for all origin states (Arizona, Mississippi, Texas, Virginia) over the next six weeks. This approach ensures that the total fixed inflow from each state is spread equally across the weekly periods. While the per-traveler infection risk (I/Pop) varies significantly among origin states (e.g., Mississippi's I/Pop is substantially higher than Arizona's), this strategy collectively minimizes cumulative infections and deaths in New Mexico by preventing concentrated surges of imported cases from *any* source in *any* single week. By smoothing out the influx of potential infections, New Mexico's internal epidemic control mechanisms are better able to manage a predictable and consistent level of external pressure. 2. **Quantitative cooperation logic**: The core principle is to balance the risk across both weeks and states by setting each weekly fraction (ft) to approximately 1/6 for all origin states. This means that for any given week t, the expected number of imported infections from a state `i` is `Flow_i * (1/6) * (I_i / Pop_i)`. By keeping `ft` constant, we ensure that the weekly imported infection rate from each state is proportional only to its total fixed flow and its inherent infection prevalence. This 'cooperation' ensures that no origin state's traffic allocation creates an unpredictable or overwhelming burden on New Mexico, thus contributing to the overall minimization of cumulative cases and deaths in the receiving state. It implicitly assumes that the average prevalence rates observed over the past 21 days will persist over the next 6 weeks. 3. **Sensitivity reasoning**: The effectiveness of this policy is sensitive to changes in the origin states' `I/Pop` prevalence. If a state's prevalence significantly increases in future weeks, the current even distribution might prove too relaxed for those weeks, potentially leading to higher imported infections than optimal. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, the policy might be overly strict. A dynamic policy responding to real-time prevalence trends would be more adaptive but is not feasible with the given static average data. New Mexico's own `beta` (0.111778) influences how quickly imported infections translate into local spread. A higher `beta` would make New Mexico more vulnerable, potentially requiring an even more cautious approach. The current policy assumes New Mexico's internal capacity can manage the consistent, averaged influx of risk."

This indicates a high prevalence of active and incubating cases, posing a substantial threat for infection importation. The potential for imported infections from Mississippi is high, directly proportional to `Flow * ft * (I/Population + E/Population)`. To minimize this risk, very low `ft` values are critical in early weeks. A strict-first approach is implemented with significant initial restrictions to drastically reduce the immediate influx of infected individuals, providing New Mexico with a buffer against a surge in cases from this high-prevalence state. Flow gradually increases in later weeks. This policy heavily prioritizes epidemic control over unrestricted mobility in the short term, accepting higher economic disruption to safeguard public health.

Given the lower I and E prevalence, the number of imported infections (`Flow * ft * (I/Population + E/Population)`) is expected to be lower per unit of flow. A more evenly distributed or slightly relaxed-first approach is chosen. This pattern facilitates a relatively consistent flow of traffic, reflecting the lower perceived immediate risk and the large total baseline flow, while still managing the weekly distribution.

    "notes": "1. **Risk interpretation:** Arizona presents a moderate-to-high risk. Its high number of Exposed (E=29298) individuals and a very high E/I ratio of 15.14 indicate a strong likelihood of increasing Infected (I) cases in the near future. The current I count is 1935. 2. **Quantitative logic:** Expected imported infections are proportional to `Flow * ft * (I/Population)` and future infections proportional to `Flow * ft * (E/Population)`. Given Arizona's high E count, the potential for importing future infections is substantial, reflected in an 'E Risk Score' of 696.07. 3. **Pattern:** A 'strict-first' approach is chosen. The initial weeks (f1, f2) have slightly lower proportions to mitigate the immediate risk from current and emerging infections (due to high E/I), allowing New Mexico to prepare. The proportions gradually increase in later weeks. 4. **Trade-offs:** This strategy prioritizes early epidemic control for New Mexico by reducing initial imported infections and exposed individuals, potentially impacting early economic activity. The relaxation in later weeks balances this by allowing more mobility once the initial peak risk is managed. 5. **Validation:** The fractions [0.15, 0.15, 0.16, 0.18, 0.18, 0.18] sum to exactly 1.0."

    "notes": "1. **Risk interpretation:** Mississippi poses an extremely high per-capita risk, with very high Infected (I=17167) and Exposed (E=35335) counts relative to its population. The E/I ratio of 2.06 suggests continued growth in infections. 2. **Quantitative logic:** Despite a lower absolute inbound flow, the high prevalence (I/Pop ＞ 0.015, E/Pop ＞ 0.031) means each traveler from Mississippi carries a significantly higher probability of being infected or exposed. The 'I Risk Score' (177.62) and 'E Risk Score' (365.19) are substantial given the low flow. Imported infections are estimated as `Flow * ft * (I/Pop)`. 3. **Pattern:** A 'strict-first' approach is implemented, with the lowest fractions in the initial weeks. This is critical to minimize exposure to Mississippi's high prevalence. The fractions slightly increase over time, assuming some stabilization or New Mexico's improved capacity to manage risk. 4. **Trade-offs:** This policy severely restricts early inbound traffic from Mississippi, aiming to prevent a rapid escalation of cases in New Mexico. This might impact specific sectors reliant on this traffic but is deemed necessary given the high infection pressure. 5. **Validation:** The fractions [0.15, 0.16, 0.17, 0.17, 0.175, 0.175] sum to exactly 1.0."

    "notes": "1. **Risk interpretation:** Texas represents the highest absolute risk due to its massive inbound flow, despite a relatively lower E/I ratio (0.59) which might suggest declining infections. The absolute number of Infected (I=16221) is very high. 2. **Quantitative logic:** The sheer volume of traffic (over 1.1 million weekly entries) means that even a moderate prevalence results in a large number of potentially imported cases. The 'I Risk Score' (719.46) is the highest among all states, indicating significant immediate infection pressure. Expected imported infections are `Flow * ft * (I/Population)`. 3. **Pattern:** A 'slightly strict-first, then even' approach is adopted. The initial weeks have slightly lower fractions to temper the immediate large influx, followed by a more even distribution. This balances the need for initial caution with the assumption of a potentially stabilizing or declining epidemic trend in Texas. 4. **Trade-offs:** Managing the immense traffic from Texas involves a delicate balance. The chosen approach aims to flatten the curve of imported cases without overly disrupting the substantial mobility, acknowledging the economic ties. Initial strictness provides a crucial buffer. 5. **Validation:** The fractions [0.17, 0.17, 0.165, 0.165, 0.165, 0.165] sum to exactly 1.0."

However, its inbound flow to New Mexico is the lowest among the origin states. 2. **Quantitative logic:** Despite the high E/I ratio, Virginia's low total inbound flow results in the lowest overall 'I Risk Score' (9.32) and 'E Risk Score' (39.31). The primary concern is the potential for future infections due to the high E count, but the absolute impact on New Mexico is limited by the low flow. Imported infections are `Flow * ft * (I/Population)`. 3. **Pattern:** A 'slightly strict-first, then even' approach is chosen. The initial weeks are slightly more restrictive to address the potential for rising infections (high E/I) but the impact is less severe due to the low baseline flow. The distribution becomes more even later. 4. **Trade-offs:** This policy allows for a relatively flexible approach given the low overall risk contribution from Virginia, while still prudently managing the initial weeks to account for the increasing infection trend indicated by the E/I ratio. Economic impact is minimal due to low flow. 5. **Validation:** The fractions [0.16, 0.16, 0.17, 0.17, 0.17, 0.17] sum to exactly 1.0."

  "global_guidance": "1. **Cross-state reasoning:** The collective strategy aims to protect New Mexico's relatively low S, E, and I counts by strategically distributing inbound traffic over the next 6 weeks. States with high E/I ratios (Arizona, Mississippi, Virginia) are subject to 'strict-first' policies to preemptively reduce the influx of individuals who are likely to become infected soon, thereby flattening the curve of imported cases. Texas, despite a potentially declining trend (low E/I), receives a 'slightly strict-first then even' distribution due to its overwhelmingly large absolute traffic volume, which could otherwise introduce a significant number of infected individuals even with low prevalence. This differentiated approach acknowledges that both prevalence and absolute flow contribute to overall risk. 2. **Quantitative cooperation logic:** The distribution of flow fractions across weeks reflects a risk-balancing act. For states with high E/I, initial weeks are more restrictive (`lower ft`) to reduce the cumulative exposure during a period when their internal epidemics are likely to worsen. As time progresses, a slight relaxation (`higher ft`) is introduced, assuming either a stabilization of the epidemic in the origin state or an increased capacity for New Mexico to manage isolated cases. For Texas, the strategy maintains a more consistent, but still cautious, flow to manage its large volume. This ensures that the total allowed flow for each state remains constant over the 6 weeks as per the constraint, but the temporal distribution minimizes the peak burden on New Mexico's healthcare system and epidemic control resources. The goal is to smooth out the influx of potential infections rather than allowing large spikes. 3. **Sensitivity reasoning:** The proposed policy is sensitive to changes in prevalence and the `beta` parameter. If the actual prevalence (I/Pop, E/Pop) in origin states turns out to be higher than estimated, the imported infection rates would be higher, potentially requiring even stricter initial controls. Conversely, if `beta` (New Mexico's infection rate) were lower, the state might be able to tolerate slightly higher initial imported cases without a significant surge. If the E/I ratios for Arizona, Mississippi, and Virginia were to decline rapidly, a more 'even' or 'relaxed-first' approach could be considered for those states in future iterations. Similarly, if Texas's E/I ratio were to increase, indicating a resurgence, more aggressive 'strict-first' measures would be immediately necessary despite its large flow. The current policy assumes the observed 21-day averages and E/I ratios are indicative of the near future trend."

Its 'I' prevalence is higher than New Mexico's, posing a notable risk, especially given its large population and significant baseline flow. 2. **Quantitative logic:** Expected imported infections are calculated as `Daily Inflow * ft * (I_texas / Population_texas)`. Given the substantial baseline flow, even a moderate prevalence warrants careful allocation. 3. **Pattern justification:** A 'slightly strict-first' pattern is adopted, with slightly lower fractions in the initial weeks followed by a more even distribution. This balances immediate control with maintaining mobility, acknowledging significant economic and social connections. 4. **Trade-offs:** This policy attempts to strike a balance between containing imported infections from a large, moderately-risky neighbor and maintaining essential cross-border mobility. The initial slight restriction aims to mitigate early risk without severely hindering overall flow. 5. **Validation:** The fractions [0.1500, 0.1600, 0.1700, 0.1700, 0.1750, 0.1750] sum to 1.0000."

    "notes": "1. **Risk interpretation:** Virginia exhibits a moderate-high infection prevalence (I/Pop = 0.001691) and a relatively high exposed prevalence (E/Pop = 0.007142). This places it as the second-highest risk state after Mississippi, indicating a significant potential for importing infections. 2. **Quantitative logic:** Imported infections are estimated as `Daily Inflow * ft * (I_virginia / Population_virginia)`. The higher prevalence of 'I' and 'E' means a higher likelihood of importing cases per unit of flow. 3. **Pattern justification:** A 'strict-first' pattern is chosen, similar to Mississippi but less aggressive. Fractions start lower and gradually increase. This approach aims to reduce immediate infection pressure, providing New Mexico with time to assess its internal capacity and adapt to potential imported cases. 4. **Trade-offs:** This policy prioritizes epidemic control over unrestricted mobility in the short term, especially given Virginia's higher infection and exposed rates. The gradual relaxation allows for adaptation while mitigating initial high-risk exposure. 5. **Validation:** The fractions [0.1200, 0.1500, 0.1700, 0.1800, 0.1900, 0.1900] sum to 1.0000."

  "global_guidance": "1. **Cross-state reasoning:** The collective strategy aims to minimize New Mexico's cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by dynamically adjusting inbound traffic based on the origin state's epidemic risk profile. States with higher current infection (I) and exposed (E) prevalence, such as Mississippi and Virginia, are subjected to 'strict-first' policies, front-loading restrictions to limit immediate importation of cases. This reduces the initial burden on New Mexico's healthcare system and slows the introduction of new infection chains. Conversely, states with lower prevalence, like Arizona, are allocated a more 'even' flow, reflecting a lower immediate threat. Texas, with its large population and moderate prevalence, receives a 'slightly strict-first' approach to cautiously manage its significant baseline flow. This differential allocation ensures that the most impactful risks are addressed proactively, preventing an overwhelming influx of cases from high-prevalence areas while maintaining necessary mobility with lower-risk regions. 2. **Quantitative cooperation logic:** The risk balancing across weeks and states is rooted in the principle that `Expected Imported Infections ~ Inflow * ft * (I/Population)`. By assigning lower `ft` values to high-risk states in early weeks, the policy quantitatively reduces the expected number of imported infections during critical initial periods. For example, Mississippi's very high I/Pop (0.02311) means that even with its relatively low ground truth inflow (1434.48), a high `ft` would lead to many imported cases. Therefore, its `ft` values are the lowest initially (0.08). In contrast, Arizona's low I/Pop (0.0004373) allows for higher and more even `ft` values. This approach aims to flatten the curve of imported cases, distributing the total ground truth flow over time in a manner that minimizes peak infection pressure on New Mexico. The gradual increase in `ft` for high-risk states in later weeks assumes either an improvement in the origin state's epidemic situation or New Mexico's enhanced capacity to manage cases, balancing long-term mobility needs with sustained epidemic control. 3. **Sensitivity reasoning:** The effectiveness of these policies is sensitive to changes in prevalence and the `beta` parameter. If an origin state's `I` or `E` prevalence rises sharply unexpectedly, the current `ft` allocations might become insufficient, requiring immediate review and potentially stricter (lower `ft`) adjustments for subsequent weeks. Conversely, a significant drop in prevalence could allow for earlier relaxation. The `beta` value for New Mexico (0.111778) indicates a moderate infection rate; if `beta` were higher, New Mexico would be more susceptible to imported cases spreading rapidly, necessitating even stricter initial controls across all states. If `beta` were lower, there would be more leeway for relaxed `ft` values. Furthermore, the accuracy of the `I/Population` estimates is crucial; underreporting of cases would underestimate risk, leading to potentially inadequate restrictions. Regular monitoring of origin state epidemic data is essential for adapting these policies."

    "notes": "Risk interpretation: Arizona's average past 21-day I/TotalPop ratio (0.000882) is approximately twice that of New Mexico (0.000424), indicating a moderately higher prevalence of active infections. The significant number of Exposed (121k) and Quarantined (174k) individuals suggests potential for future case growth, though the Recovered (234k) population offers some community immunity. Quantitative logic: Expected imported infections from Arizona into New Mexico are proportional to the total weekly inbound flow (Flow * ft), multiplied by Arizona's current infection prevalence (I/TotalPop). Specifically, imported_infected_AZ ~ (Inflow_AZ * ft) * (I_AZ / TotalPop_AZ). Pattern choice: An 'even' distribution of traffic is chosen. This pattern distributes the potential risk of imported infections uniformly across the 6-week period. Without specific projections indicating a significant change in Arizona's infection pressure, this approach prevents sudden surges in imported cases during any single week. Trade-offs: This strategy balances the need for consistent economic and social mobility with the public health objective of minimizing imported infections. It avoids overly strict initial controls that could hinder essential travel, while also preventing a concentrated influx of risk at a later time. Validation: The sum of the six fractions is 0.1667 + 0.1667 + 0.1667 + 0.1666 + 0.1666 + 0.1667 = 1.0000."

    "notes": "Risk interpretation: Mississippi presents a significantly higher risk due to its very high I/TotalPop ratio (0.055042), which is approximately 130 times that of New Mexico (0.000424). This indicates a substantially higher prevalence of active infections. The large number of Exposed (102k) and Infected (43k) individuals relative to its smaller total population suggests a strong potential for ongoing local transmission and a high probability of importing infected individuals. Quantitative logic: Expected imported infections from Mississippi into New Mexico are directly proportional to the weekly inbound flow (Flow * ft) and Mississippi's high infection prevalence (I/TotalPop). Specifically, imported_infected_MS ~ (Inflow_MS * ft) * (I_MS / TotalPop_MS). Given the high I_ratio, even small flows can carry significant risk. Pattern choice: An 'even' distribution of traffic is adopted. Despite Mississippi's high infection pressure, without specific future trend data, an even distribution provides a consistent level of risk management. While a 'strict-first' approach might seem intuitive for high-risk states, an even distribution ensures the total risk is spread over time, preventing any single week from bearing a disproportionate burden if conditions remain stable or unpredictable. Trade-offs: This strategy aims to manage the high risk from Mississippi by spreading it uniformly over the 6 weeks. It balances the necessity of maintaining mandated inbound flow with the imperative to minimize the impact of imported infections on New Mexico's healthcare system and population. Validation: The sum of the six fractions is 0.1667 + 0.1667 + 0.1667 + 0.1666 + 0.1666 + 0.1667 = 1.0000."

    "notes": "Risk interpretation: Texas has an I/TotalPop ratio (0.001991) that is approximately 4.7 times higher than New Mexico's (0.000424). This signifies a moderately elevated risk of infection prevalence. While its population is much larger, the raw number of Infected (44k) and Quarantined (225k) individuals is substantial, indicating ongoing disease activity. Quantitative logic: The number of imported infections from Texas into New Mexico is expected to be proportional to the weekly inbound flow (Flow * ft) and Texas's infection prevalence (I/TotalPop). The formula is imported_infected_TX ~ (Inflow_TX * ft) * (I_TX / TotalPop_TX). Pattern choice: An 'even' distribution of traffic is implemented. This pattern ensures a consistent and predictable level of inbound traffic and associated infection risk across all six weeks. Given the absence of specific forecasts for Texas's epidemic trajectory, this approach provides a stable risk profile for New Mexico. Trade-offs: This allocation strategy attempts to balance the significant volume of inbound traffic from Texas with the need to control disease spread. By maintaining a steady flow, it supports economic and social connections while managing the public health risk without imposing abrupt fluctuations in control measures.

This indicates a notable prevalence of active infections. The relatively high numbers of Exposed (109k) and Infected (26k) suggest ongoing community transmission, posing a higher risk of importing cases compared to New Mexico's internal situation. Quantitative logic: The anticipated imported infections from Virginia to New Mexico are proportional to the weekly inbound flow (Flow * ft) and Virginia's infection prevalence (I/TotalPop). Specifically, imported_infected_VA ~ (Inflow_VA * ft) * (I_VA / TotalPop_VA). Pattern choice: An 'even' distribution of traffic is chosen. This uniform distribution ensures that the risk of imported infections from Virginia is spread consistently over the 6-week period. In the absence of data predicting future changes in Virginia's epidemic status, this approach maintains a predictable and manageable influx of potential cases. Trade-offs: This policy aims to accommodate the required inbound mobility from Virginia while prudently managing the elevated infection risk.

  "global_guidance": "The collective strategy of applying an 'even' distribution of inbound traffic across all origin states (Arizona, Mississippi, Texas, and Virginia) is designed to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in New Mexico by stabilizing the rate of imported infections. By distributing the total mandated flow uniformly over the next six weeks, this policy prevents large, unpredictable surges of potentially infected individuals from any single origin state. This approach is particularly critical given the varying and often significantly higher infection prevalence (I/TotalPop) in the origin states compared to New Mexico. For instance, Mississippi's I/TotalPop ratio is approximately 130 times higher than New Mexico's, while Virginia's and Texas's are approximately 6.7 and 4.7 times higher, respectively. Uniform distribution mitigates the risk of overwhelming New Mexico's healthcare system with concentrated imported cases. This policy leverages a risk-balancing principle across both time and origin states. For each state, expected imported infections are proportional to `Flow * ft * (I/population)`. By setting `ft` to be approximately 1/6 for all weeks and all states, we ensure that the weekly expected imported infections from each state are relatively constant: `expected_weekly_imported_infections ~ (TotalFlow_State / 6) * (I_State / TotalPop_State)`. This creates a predictable and manageable influx of risk, allowing New Mexico to better allocate resources for testing, contact tracing, and treatment. This approach implicitly assumes that the I/population ratio of each origin state will remain relatively stable over the 6-week period, as no future projections are provided. The effectiveness of this policy is sensitive to several factors. If an origin state's I/population ratio were projected to significantly increase in specific weeks, a 'strict-first' approach (lower ft in initial weeks) might be more effective. Conversely, if prevalence were projected to decrease, a 'relaxed-first' approach could be considered. If New Mexico's internal epidemic status (e.g., beta or I_ratio) were to rise sharply, even a stable influx of imported cases could trigger a larger internal epidemic, necessitating a more aggressive 'strict-first' approach. The policy also relies on the accuracy of the provided 21-day average SEIQRD values; continuous monitoring and potential recalibration of `ft` values would be crucial if real-time prevalence deviates significantly."
