While its Q, R, D counts show ongoing epidemic activity, the overall severity is moderate relative to other origin states. Quantitative logic: With a baseline daily inflow of 28201.62, Arizona is estimated to contribute approximately 11.29 (E+I) individuals per day if flow were unrestricted. This is a notable contribution to Texas's overall infection risk. Pattern choice: A \"strict-first\" pattern is chosen to front-load restrictions. This minimizes the initial influx of potential infections, allowing Texas's low R0 to continue mitigating its internal epidemic before increasing mobility. Trade-offs: This pattern balances the need for epidemic control by reducing early exposure against the fixed total mobility requirement over six weeks, distributing the flow more heavily towards later, potentially safer, periods.

This strategy front-loads restrictions, significantly reducing inbound flow in the initial weeks. The aim is to minimize the immediate influx of highly prevalent infections, thereby slowing down the potential for exponential growth within Texas and allowing more time for Texas's epidemic response to adapt. \n4. **Trade-offs:** This policy heavily prioritizes epidemic control over mobility from Mississippi in the short term. While it reduces overall weekly travel from Mississippi, the total 6-week flow remains constant, meaning some mobility is deferred to later weeks. The trade-off is a potentially higher number of travelers in later weeks in exchange for substantially lower early infection risk. \n5. **Validation:** The sum of fractions [0.2300, 0.2000, 0.1800, 0.1500, 0.1200, 0.1200] is exactly 1.0000."

Despite having the highest average daily inbound flow to Texas, its very low prevalence results in the lowest combined risk of importing infections. This suggests that travelers from New Mexico are, on average, less likely to be infected or exposed. \n2. **Quantitative logic:** The number of imported infections is directly proportional to `Flow * ft * (E+I)/population`. Given New Mexico's extremely low (E+I)/population ratio, even with high total flow, the risk of importing infected individuals is minimal compared to other states. \n3. **Pattern justification:** An \"even\" distribution pattern ([0.1667, 0.1667, 0.1666, 0.1667, 0.1666, 0.1667]) is selected. This allows for a consistent and predictable flow over the six weeks, as the risk posed by New Mexico is deemed sufficiently low to not warrant aggressive early restrictions. This approach minimizes disruption to existing mobility patterns. \n4. **Trade-offs:** This policy primarily prioritizes maintaining stable mobility with minimal disruption, as the epidemic control benefits from restricting a low-prevalence state are marginal. The trade-off is minimal, as the risk of imported infections is already low, allowing for a consistent travel pattern without significant epidemiological cost. \n5. **Validation:** The sum of fractions [0.1667, 0.1667, 0.1666, 0.1667, 0.1666, 0.1667] is exactly 1.0000."

Due to the lowest overall flow among the origin states, the absolute number of imported infections will be relatively lower, even with similar `ft` values as other states. \n3. **Pattern justification:** A \"mild strict-first\" pattern is chosen for Virginia ([0.1800, 0.1750, 0.1700, 0.1650, 0.1550, 0.1550]). While its combined risk is among the lowest, a slight front-loading of restrictions serves as a conservative measure to further minimize any initial surge, aligning with the overall goal of minimizing cumulative cases without imposing severe mobility constraints. \n4. **Trade-offs:** This policy strikes a balance by slightly favoring early epidemic control without imposing severe restrictions, given the state's lower contribution to overall imported risk. Mobility is managed to ensure the total flow over six weeks remains constant, with minimal disruption to the overall travel pattern from Virginia, while still prudently managing risk. \n5. **Validation:** The sum of fractions [0.1800, 0.1750, 0.1700, 0.1650, 0.1550, 0.1550] is exactly 1.0000."

A 'slightly strict-first' pattern is chosen to gently delay inbound flow. While the risk is low, prioritizing epidemic control means that even minor delays contribute to reducing cumulative cases and allow more time for potential epidemic improvements in both states.

A 'strict-first' pattern is implemented, with very low fractions in early weeks.

A 'moderately strict-first' pattern is adopted, with lower fractions allocated to the initial weeks, gradually increasing towards the end of the 6-week period.

This is achieved by implementing a tiered approach based on the origin state's current infection pressure (I/Population).

This drastically reduces the immediate risk of importing a large number of infected individuals. Conversely, states with very low infection rates (e.g., New Mexico) experience minimal initial restrictions, allowing for a more consistent or slightly front-loaded flow, as their contribution to imported cases is expected to be negligible. Moderate-risk states (e.g., Virginia, Arizona) receive a moderately delayed flow, balancing control with mobility. This differential approach ensures that Texas allocates its limited control measures most effectively against the highest-risk sources, while maintaining necessary mobility where the risk is low. The core principle is to manage the total expected imported infections (sum_i(Flow_i * ft_i * (I_i/Pop_i))) into Texas over the 6-week period.

This 'flattens the curve' of imported cases, preventing an early surge that could overwhelm Texas's healthcare capacity and accelerate its internal epidemic spread. The fixed total flow constraint means that the overall number of potential imported infections remains constant per origin state, but by delaying them, we buy valuable time for Texas's own S, E, I, R, D dynamics to evolve more favorably (e.g., more people recover, or local control measures take effect), thereby reducing the impact of these later-arriving imported cases. This strategic timing across states and weeks is crucial for minimizing cumulative cases. These recommendations are highly sensitive to changes in the underlying epidemic conditions. If an origin state's I/Population significantly increases, its inbound flow fractions would need to become even more 'strict-first'.

Quantitative logic: The expected imported infections from Arizona into Texas are estimated as Flow * ft * (I / Population).

Quantitative logic: The potential for imported infections from Mississippi is significantly higher (Flow * I/Pop  1411.7 daily potential) than other states.

    "notes": "Risk interpretation: New Mexico shows a very low number of exposed (E=6.4k) and infected (I=1.4k) individuals relative to its population (~6.88M). Its I/Population ratio is approximately 0.000212, indicating the lowest infection pressure among the origin states. Quantitative logic: The expected imported infections from New Mexico are estimated to be very low (Flow * I/Pop  26.21 daily potential). Given this low baseline risk, an even distribution of flow will not significantly increase the epidemic burden on Texas. Pattern choice: An 'even distribution' pattern ([0.1666, 0.1667, ..., 0.1666]) is chosen. This maintains a consistent level of mobility without significant temporal shifts, as the current infection pressure does not warrant stricter early controls. Trade-offs: This approach balances consistent mobility with minimal epidemic risk, as New Mexico's low prevalence poses a minor threat. It avoids unnecessary disruption to mobility patterns. Validation: The sum of fractions is 0.1666 + 0.1667 + 0.1667 + 0.1667 + 0.1667 + 0.1666 = 1.0000."

Its I/Population ratio is approximately 0.00170, indicating a moderate infection pressure. Quantitative logic: The potential for imported infections from Virginia (Flow * I/Pop  50.58 daily potential) is higher than Arizona and New Mexico but significantly lower than Mississippi. While not as critical as Mississippi, it still warrants careful management. Pattern choice: A 'strict-first' pattern ([0.1, 0.15, 0.15, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]) is applied. Similar to Arizona, this front-loads restrictions to mitigate early imported infections, allowing Texas to manage its internal epidemic more effectively. This approach provides a cautious stance against a moderate risk. Trade-offs: This policy prioritizes early public health benefits by reducing initial imported cases, potentially leading to a slight deferral of mobility-dependent economic activities from Virginia to later weeks. Validation: The sum of fractions is 0.1 + 0.15 + 0.15 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 = 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "The overarching strategy aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Texas by strategically allocating inbound traffic over the next six weeks, with a strong emphasis on mitigating early infection importation. Cross-state reasoning: Mississippi is identified as the highest-risk origin due to its significantly elevated infection prevalence (I/Population). Consequently, it receives the most stringent 'strict-first' allocation, with minimal flow in early weeks to prevent a rapid surge of imported cases in Texas. Virginia and Arizona, presenting moderate to low-moderate risks, also adopt a 'strict-first' approach, albeit less aggressively than Mississippi, to create a protective buffer against their potential contributions to Texas's caseload. New Mexico, with the lowest infection prevalence, is assigned an 'even distribution' as its risk profile does not necessitate temporal adjustments to flow. This differentiated approach ensures that the state with the highest potential for seeding new infections is managed most aggressively upfront. Quantitative cooperation logic: This policy leverages the principle that early infections have a compounding effect within the SEIRD model. By reducing the initial inflow of infected individuals, especially from high-prevalence states like Mississippi (e.g., reducing potential imported infections from ~1411.7 daily to ~70.58 in week 1 via f1=0.05), the overall epidemic trajectory in Texas can be significantly flattened. The combined effect of these policies is to 'smooth out' the total imported infection load over the 6-week period, delaying and reducing peak influxes, thereby allowing Texas's internal healthcare system more time to adapt and respond. Sensitivity reasoning: This policy is sensitive to changes in origin states' prevalence. A sudden spike in 'I' or 'E' in a currently low-risk state (e.g., New Mexico) would necessitate an immediate re-evaluation and a shift towards a 'strict-first' policy for that state. Conversely, a sustained decline in prevalence across all states could warrant a more relaxed approach earlier. The policy also assumes a degree of stability in Texas's own epidemic parameters; a higher-than-expected internal transmission rate (beta) would magnify the impact of any imported infections, arguing for even stricter controls across the board. Furthermore, the effectiveness relies on accurate prevalence data and high compliance with mobility policies."

    "notes": "Arizona exhibits a relatively low current infection prevalence (I/Pop_AZ = 0.00088) compared to Texas's. However, the high number of Exposed (E = 121724) suggests a potential for an increase in active infections in the coming weeks. The high confirmed (Q) cases indicate significant past spread. Expected imported infections are proportional to `Flow * ft * (I/Population_AZ)`. Given the potential for `I` to rise due to the high `E` population, stricter controls early on will help mitigate future imported cases if the situation worsens. A 'strict-first' pattern is chosen, allocating less inbound flow in the initial weeks and gradually increasing it. This aims to delay and potentially reduce the peak of imported infections. This policy prioritizes epidemic control by front-loading restrictions, accepting a temporary reduction in mobility to safeguard against future surges.

    "notes": "Mississippi presents an extremely high risk due to its very high infection prevalence (I/Pop_MS = 0.055), significantly greater than Texas's. The substantial Exposed (E) population further indicates a high likelihood of continued or increased infection rates, coupled with an increasing inbound flow to Texas. Imported infections are directly proportional to `Flow * ft * (I/Population_MS)`. With Mississippi's high `I/Population` and increasing flow, immediate and stringent controls are essential. A very 'strict-first' pattern is implemented, severely limiting early-week inbound flow and progressively easing restrictions. This pattern is critical for minimizing the high infection pressure from Mississippi, giving Texas more time to prepare or for Mississippi's epidemic to subside. This policy strongly favors epidemic control over immediate mobility, with mobility gradually restored as the risk potentially diminishes.

    "notes": "New Mexico has a very low current infection prevalence (I/Pop_NM = 0.000373), considerably lower than Texas. The `E` population is also relatively low, suggesting a stable or declining infection trend. While New Mexico's `I/Population` is low, its absolute inbound flow to Texas is the highest. Imported infections are proportional to `Flow * ft * (I/Population_NM)`. Given the very low per-capita risk and a decreasing trend in total flow, a 'relaxed-first' approach is adopted, allowing a slightly higher proportion of traffic in the initial weeks, gradually decreasing. This pattern leverages the current low infection risk from New Mexico, facilitating mobility when the per-capita risk is lowest. This policy prioritizes supporting mobility from a low-risk state in the short term, balancing it against the need for sustained epidemic control.

Given Virginia's higher prevalence and substantial `E` population, managing the flow to prevent an early surge of imported cases is crucial. A 'strict-first' pattern is chosen, limiting inbound flow in the initial weeks and gradually increasing it.

  "global_guidance": "The inbound allocation policies for Texas are designed to collectively minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by dynamically responding to varying infection risks and traffic volumes from each origin state. States with very high infection prevalence (e.g., Mississippi) or high potential for future surges (e.g., Arizona, Virginia due to high E counts) are assigned 'strict-first' patterns, front-loading mobility restrictions to reduce immediate importation risks. Conversely, states with very low prevalence (e.g., New Mexico) are given a 'relaxed-first' approach, allowing for greater early mobility when the per-capita risk of infection importation is minimal. This differential treatment ensures that resources and restrictions are applied where they are most impactful, preventing Texas from being overwhelmed by external infection pressure. The overall strategy aims to smooth out the total imported infection curve over the six weeks, rather than facing a sudden spike.\n\nThe core principle is `imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/Population_origin)`. By adjusting `ft` (weekly proportions), we aim to shift the burden of imported infections away from periods when an origin state's `I/Population` is high, or when Texas's own internal epidemic might be more vulnerable. For instance, Mississippi's extremely high `I/Population` dictates very low `ft` in early weeks, effectively 'buying time' for Texas. New Mexico, despite its high absolute flow, has a very low `I/Population`, allowing for higher `ft` values earlier, thereby distributing the overall mobility more efficiently. This creates a risk-balanced portfolio of inbound traffic, where the combined contribution of imported infections from all states is managed to stay within Texas's capacity, while respecting the constant total flow for each origin state.\n\n The effectiveness of these policies is highly sensitive to the accuracy of the SEIQRD parameters and the future trajectory of the epidemic in origin states. If the `I` or `E` populations in 'strict-first' states (e.g., Mississippi, Virginia, Arizona) do not decrease as implicitly hoped for in later weeks, then the increasing `ft` values could lead to a higher-than-desired influx of infected individuals. Conversely, if `I` or `E` in 'relaxed-first' states (e.g., New Mexico) unexpectedly surge, the early relaxation of `ft` could exacerbate Texas's case counts. The model assumes a relatively stable `I/Population` for the 21-day average, but real-time data would be crucial for adaptive adjustments. Furthermore, the `beta` (infection rate) in Texas could influence its capacity to absorb imported cases; a higher `beta` would necessitate even stricter controls across the board, while a lower `beta` might allow for more flexibility."
