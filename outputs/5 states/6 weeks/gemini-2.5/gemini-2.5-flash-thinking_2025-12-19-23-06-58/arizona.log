    "notes": "1. **Risk interpretation:** Mississippi exhibits the highest (E+I+Q)/Population ratio among the origin states at approximately 0.001721 (5122 active/exposed cases out of 2,976,149 total population). This indicates a significant burden of active and incubating infections, posing a high risk of disease importation to Arizona. The S, E, I, Q, R, D values reflect a moderately active epidemic state. 2. **Quantitative logic:** The expected number of imported infections from Mississippi into Arizona is approximated by `Daily Flow * ft * (E + I + Q) / Population`. With Mississippi having the highest (E+I+Q) prevalence, a higher `ft` would directly lead to a proportionally higher number of imported cases. 3. **Pattern justification:** A 'strict-first' allocation pattern [0.1, 0.15, 0.17, 0.18, 0.2, 0.2] is chosen. This strategy prioritizes minimizing immediate infection importation during the initial weeks when Arizona's susceptible population is highest and any introduced cases could rapidly escalate. Gradually relaxing controls in later weeks allows for some recovery or adaptation within Arizona. 4. **Trade-offs:** This policy imposes significant mobility restrictions on travelers from Mississippi in the early weeks. While this reduces the risk of importing infections, it limits economic and social interactions. The trade-off is a preference for epidemic control over immediate, unconstrained mobility from a high-risk source. 5. **Validation:** The sum of fractions (0.1 + 0.15 + 0.17 + 0.18 + 0.2 + 0.2) is exactly 1.0."

    "notes": "1. **Risk interpretation:** New Mexico presents the second-highest (E+I+Q)/Population ratio, approximately 0.001455 (3051 active/exposed cases out of 2,096,829 total population). This signifies a considerable active infection and exposure rate, indicating a substantial risk for importing cases into Arizona. 2. **Quantitative logic:** Expected imported infections are estimated by `Daily Flow * ft * (E + I + Q) / Population`. Given New Mexico's elevated prevalence, higher `ft` values would proportionally increase the influx of potentially infected individuals. 3. **Pattern justification:** A 'strict-first' pattern [0.12, 0.16, 0.17, 0.18, 0.18, 0.19] is adopted. This approach aims to front-load control measures to mitigate the initial wave of potential imported cases, similar to Mississippi but slightly less stringent due to a marginally lower prevalence. This allows Arizona more time to manage its internal epidemic situation. 4. **Trade-offs:** Early-week mobility from New Mexico is moderately restricted, impacting travel and economic activities. This decision balances the need for epidemic control against the desire for unhindered mobility, leaning towards control to protect public health in Arizona. 5. **Validation:** The sum of fractions (0.12 + 0.16 + 0.17 + 0.18 + 0.18 + 0.19) is exactly 1.0."

This indicates a relatively low current prevalence of active and exposed cases, suggesting a lower risk of infection importation compared to other states. 2. **Quantitative logic:** The anticipated number of imported infections from Texas is estimated as `Daily Flow * ft * (E + I + Q) / Population`. Due to Texas's low (E+I+Q) prevalence, the risk of importing infections per unit of flow is comparatively low. 3. **Pattern justification:** A 'gradually relaxed' pattern [0.16, 0.16, 0.16, 0.17, 0.17, 0.18] is chosen. Given the lower risk, there's less urgency for stringent early controls. This pattern allows for a relatively consistent flow, with a slight increase in later weeks, reflecting the lower immediate threat. 4. **Trade-offs:** This policy allows for higher and more consistent mobility from Texas across the 6 weeks, which supports economic and social connections. The trade-off is a slightly increased, but still low, level of sustained import risk, deemed acceptable given the low prevalence in Texas. 5. **Validation:** The sum of fractions (0.16 + 0.16 + 0.16 + 0.17 + 0.17 + 0.18) is exactly 1.0."

This indicates a notable, but not excessively high, level of active and incubating infections, placing it between New Mexico and Texas in terms of import risk. 2. **Quantitative logic:** The projected imported infections from Virginia are calculated as `Daily Flow * ft * (E + I + Q) / Population`. The moderate prevalence means that `ft` values must be managed to control the influx of potential cases. 3. **Pattern justification:** A 'slightly strict-first' pattern [0.15, 0.16, 0.17, 0.17, 0.17, 0.18] is implemented. This balances initial caution with a gradual easing of restrictions, recognizing the moderate risk level. It aims to reduce the immediate burden on Arizona's healthcare system while maintaining a reasonable level of mobility. 4. **Trade-offs:** This approach involves a moderate restriction on early mobility from Virginia, which might affect some travel plans. However, it prioritizes mitigating the risk of importing infections, balancing the need for public health protection with the desire for economic and social activity. 5. **Validation:** The sum of fractions (0.15 + 0.16 + 0.17 + 0.17 + 0.17 + 0.18) is exactly 1.0."

  "global_guidance": "1. **Cross-state reasoning:** The collective inbound allocation strategy aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Arizona by differentially managing infection importation risks from various origin states. States with higher (E+I+Q)/Population ratios (Mississippi, New Mexico) are subjected to stricter early-week controls to prevent immediate surges in Arizona's infection rates, given Arizona's current moderate internal prevalence. Conversely, states with lower prevalence (Texas) face less stringent restrictions, allowing for greater mobility. Virginia, with moderate risk, receives a balanced approach. This differential treatment ensures that resources for epidemic control in Arizona are not overwhelmed by high-risk imports, especially in the initial weeks, while maintaining essential mobility where risks are lower. 2. **Quantitative cooperation logic:** The core of this strategy is to balance the expected imported infection load across weeks and states. By using `Flow * ft * (E+I+Q)/Population` as the primary metric for potential imported cases, the policy distributes the total allowed flow (over 6 weeks) in a manner that minimizes the peak and cumulative imported cases. For high-risk states, `ft` is kept lower in early weeks to reduce the initial 'shock' of imported infections, effectively 'flattening the curve' of imported cases into Arizona. For lower-risk states, `ft` can be higher, as the `(E+I+Q)/Population` factor is already low. This cooperative logic ensures that while total flow remains constant, its temporal distribution minimizes the burden on Arizona's public health system. 3. **Sensitivity reasoning:** The effectiveness of this policy is sensitive to several factors. If the actual prevalence (E+I+Q)/Population in origin states significantly changes (e.g., a sudden outbreak in a low-risk state like Texas or a rapid decline in Mississippi), the `ft` allocations would need immediate re-evaluation. Similarly, if Arizona's internal `beta` (infection rate) or `alpha` (incubation rate) were higher than estimated, the impact of imported cases would be amplified, necessitating even stricter controls. Conversely, if Arizona's population develops higher immunity or if origin states implement more effective internal controls, the current `ft` values might be overly restrictive, allowing for more relaxed mobility without compromising control. The accuracy of the SEIQRD parameters and population compositions is crucial; any significant deviation could alter the optimal allocation strategy."

This poses a substantial risk of importing cases to Arizona, despite its relatively lower inbound flow. The estimated imported infections are proportional to Flow * ft * (E+I)/Population. To mitigate this high per-traveler risk, a **strict-first** traffic allocation pattern is adopted, with lower fractions in the initial weeks (0.1, 0.1). This aims to immediately reduce the influx of potentially infected individuals. The fractions gradually increase in later weeks, allowing for a phased relaxation. This policy prioritizes epidemic control by front-loading restrictions to prevent an early surge, accepting a temporary reduction in mobility from Mississippi in exchange for safeguarding Arizona's public health.

Consequently, the risk of importing cases from New Mexico is minimal, even with its relatively high daily inbound flow. Expected imported infections, calculated as Flow * ft * (E+I)/Population, will be very low. An **even distribution** pattern is chosen for traffic allocation. This approach allows for consistent and predictable mobility without imposing unnecessary restrictions, as the low epidemiological risk does not warrant stringent controls at any specific time. The trade-off is negligible, as maintaining steady mobility from this low-risk state poses minimal threat to Arizona's epidemic control efforts.

An **even distribution** pattern is selected. Despite the high total flow, the low prevalence in Texas minimizes the acute risk, making an even distribution effective for managing the overall low risk consistently across the six weeks. This strategy prioritizes maintaining stable mobility given the low per-capita risk, accepting a steady, low rate of imported infections rather than imposing disproportionately severe restrictions.

This indicates a moderate per-traveler risk of importing infections. However, its daily inbound flow to Arizona is relatively low, meaning the overall impact of imported cases (Flow * ft * (E+I)/Population) will be small in absolute terms. An **even distribution** pattern is chosen. Given the moderate prevalence but low flow, an even distribution offers a balanced approach, avoiding unnecessary fluctuations in mobility while spreading the manageable risk evenly over the six-week period. This policy maintains consistent mobility from Virginia, acknowledging the moderate risk but recognizing that its low overall impact due to limited flow does not necessitate stricter, uneven controls.

  "global_guidance": "The overarching strategy aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Arizona by implementing risk-differentiated mobility policies for each origin state. Cross-state reasoning identifies Mississippi as the highest per-traveler risk due to its significantly elevated (E+I)/Population ratio. Consequently, a 'strict-first' approach is applied to Mississippi, front-loading restrictions to immediately curb potential high-prevalence imports and prevent an early surge in Arizona's caseload. In contrast, New Mexico and Texas, despite high inbound flows, exhibit very low (E+I)/Population ratios, posing minimal per-traveler risk. For these states, an 'even distribution' of traffic is adopted to maintain stable mobility without significantly increasing the epidemiological burden on Arizona. Virginia, with moderate prevalence but low flow, also receives an 'even distribution' to balance its moderate per-traveler risk with its limited overall impact. This collective approach strategically allocates mobility restrictions where the risk of imported infection is highest, while preserving mobility where the risk is manageable, thereby optimizing epidemic control efficiency across all origin states. The quantitative cooperation logic ensures that the product of `Flow * ft * (E+I)/Population` is managed across states and weeks to flatten the curve of potential imported infections. For Mississippi, lower `ft` in early weeks directly reduces this product during critical initial periods. For low-prevalence states, an even `ft` (approx. 1/6) distributes the minimal risk consistently. This prevents any single week from experiencing an undue influx of cases, particularly from high-risk sources, thus contributing to a more stable epidemic trajectory in Arizona. The policy's sensitivity is notable; significant changes in an origin state's (E+I)/Population prevalence or unexpected deviations in actual inbound flow from the ground truth averages would necessitate immediate re-evaluation and adjustment of the weekly fractions. For instance, a sharp increase in prevalence in Texas would require a shift from an 'even' to a 'strict-first' or more restrictive pattern to protect Arizona."

This indicates a high probability of individuals entering Arizona being infected. Arizona itself has a significant exposed (E=71912) and infected (I=4718) population, making it vulnerable to additional imported cases. 2. **Quantitative logic:** Expected imported infected individuals from Mississippi are estimated to be approximately `Flow * ft * (I/Population_mississippi)`. Given Mississippi's high I/population, even a moderate flow can introduce a substantial number of infected individuals. With a baseline flow of 2743.86, the potential daily imported infected is ~63.45, the highest among all states. 3. **Pattern justification:** A \"strict-first\" pattern is adopted, with lower fractions in the initial weeks and gradually increasing fractions later ([0.08, 0.12, 0.15, 0.20, 0.22, 0.23]). This strategy front-loads traffic restrictions to the earlier weeks. The rationale is to minimize the initial influx of potentially infected individuals from a high-prevalence state, thereby mitigating the risk of accelerating Arizona's internal epidemic growth, especially given Arizona's current E and I numbers. 4. **Trade-offs:** This policy prioritizes epidemic control over immediate mobility. While it restricts early-week travel, it allows for a gradual increase in flow over time, balancing the need to curb disease spread with the eventual need for economic and social mobility. The total flow over 6 weeks remains constant, ensuring long-term mobility needs are met. 5. **Validation:** The sum of fractions is 0.08 + 0.12 + 0.15 + 0.20 + 0.22 + 0.23 = 1.00."

    "notes": "1. **Risk interpretation:** Texas has a moderate infection pressure (I/population ~ 0.000966). However, its significantly high baseline inbound flow to Arizona means that even this moderate prevalence translates into a substantial number of potentially imported infected individuals. Arizona's high E and moderate I populations make it susceptible to additional caseloads. 2. **Quantitative logic:** Expected imported infected individuals from Texas are estimated as `Flow * ft * (I/Population_texas)`. With the highest baseline flow of 51312.76, Texas has the second-highest potential daily imported infected (~49.56), making it a critical source of potential introductions. 3. **Pattern justification:** A \"strict-first\" pattern is implemented ([0.10, 0.14, 0.16, 0.18, 0.20, 0.22]). This decision is driven by the high absolute number of potential imported infections, aiming to significantly reduce early introductions and give Arizona's healthcare system time to manage its existing burden. 4. **Trade-offs:** This policy prioritizes immediate epidemic control by significantly restricting early-week mobility from Texas. While this might impact short-term economic and social exchanges, it is deemed necessary to prevent a surge in cases in Arizona. The total flow remains constant, allowing for increased mobility in later weeks. 5. **Validation:** The sum of fractions is 0.10 + 0.14 + 0.16 + 0.18 + 0.20 + 0.22 = 1.00."

Its relatively lower baseline flow to Arizona means the absolute number of imported infections is moderate compared to Mississippi and Texas. Arizona's internal disease dynamics necessitate cautious management of all imported risks. 2. **Quantitative logic:** Expected imported infected individuals from Virginia are estimated by `Flow * ft * (I/Population_virginia)`. With a baseline flow of 6712.05, the potential daily imported infected is approximately ~11.34, placing it as a moderate risk contributor. 3. **Pattern justification:** A \"strict-first\" pattern ([0.12, 0.15, 0.17, 0.18, 0.19, 0.19]) is chosen. Although its overall contribution to imported cases is lower than Mississippi or Texas, its higher I/population compared to New Mexico warrants a more cautious approach, especially in the initial weeks, to further protect Arizona from additional infections. 4. **Trade-offs:** This policy balances epidemic control with mobility. It imposes stricter controls in early weeks to reduce infection risk, gradually easing them over time. This approach aims to prevent an early increase in cases while accommodating long-term mobility requirements. 5. **Validation:** The sum of fractions is 0.12 + 0.15 + 0.17 + 0.18 + 0.19 + 0.19 = 1.00."

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound allocations are designed to strategically reduce the overall expected imported infections and deaths in Arizona. By implementing a \"strict-first\" approach for states with higher infection pressure (Mississippi, Virginia) or significant absolute imported infection potential (Texas), we aim to minimize the introduction of new cases when Arizona's own epidemic state (high E, moderate I) is most vulnerable. This early reduction in imported cases helps to flatten the curve of new infections, preventing overwhelming the healthcare system and ultimately reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases.\n\nThe quantitative cooperation logic revolves around minimizing the product of `Flow * ft * (I/Population_origin_state)`. States with a higher `I/Population` (like Mississippi) or a very high `Flow` (like Texas) are assigned lower `ft` values in the initial weeks, effectively reducing their contribution to imported infections when Arizona is most susceptible. As Arizona's internal epidemic situation might evolve or stabilize over the 6-week period, and internal control measures take effect, the `ft` values are gradually increased in later weeks for these higher-risk states. This strategy ensures that the overall imported infection burden is managed dynamically, with a strong emphasis on early prevention to leverage the non-linear dynamics of epidemic spread. The total flow from each state remains constant over the 6 weeks, reflecting a commitment to long-term mobility while optimizing its temporal distribution for public health.\n\nThe effectiveness of these policies is sensitive to several factors. If the actual prevalence (`I/Population`) in origin states varies significantly from the 21-day averages, the estimated imported infection risk will change, potentially requiring adjustment of `ft` values. For instance, a sudden surge in infections in a low-risk state like New Mexico would necessitate stricter controls. Similarly, variations in the disease transmission rate (`beta`) within Arizona would alter the impact of imported cases; a higher `beta` would make Arizona more sensitive to any imported infections, reinforcing the need for stricter early controls. The accuracy of other SEIQRD parameters (alpha, gamma, mu, delta) also influences Arizona's internal epidemic projection, which in turn informs the level of acceptable imported risk. Continuous monitoring of these parameters and real-time adjustments to flow fractions would be crucial for optimal control."

    "notes": "Mississippi exhibits the highest average (E+I)/Population ratio (approximately 18.5%) among the origin states, signifying a very high active infection prevalence. This makes it the most significant risk for importing new infections into Arizona. The expected imported infections are quantitatively linked to `Flow * ft * (E_mississippi + I_mississippi) / Pop_mississippi`. To mitigate this high risk, a 'strict-first' traffic allocation pattern is implemented, with lower fractions in the initial weeks (0.10, 0.12) and gradually increasing towards the end of the 6-week period. This strategy aims to defer the highest potential infection pressure, allowing Arizona more time to manage its internal epidemic. The trade-off is a temporary reduction in immediate mobility from Mississippi for a projected improvement in Arizona's public health outcomes. The fractions sum precisely to 1.00."

    "notes": "New Mexico presents a remarkably low average (E+I)/Population ratio (approximately 0.2%). Despite a substantial average daily inbound flow, its low prevalence translates to the lowest potential for importing infections into Arizona. The quantitative logic `Imported_E_I ~ Flow * ft * (E_newmexico + I_newmexico) / Pop_newmexico` confirms that its contribution to imported cases is minimal. Given this low epidemiological risk, an 'even' distribution pattern is selected for the weekly fractions. This approach ensures consistent and predictable mobility without imposing unnecessary restrictions, as the health benefit from strict-first controls would be negligible. The primary trade-off is negligible, as consistent mobility is maintained with minimal public health risk. The fractions sum precisely to 1.000000."

While its prevalence is lower than Mississippi and Virginia, its very high average daily inbound flow to Arizona means it still poses a considerable absolute risk for imported infections.

A 'moderately strict-first' pattern is adopted, characterized by slightly reduced fractions in early weeks (0.14, 0.15) that incrementally increase. This strategy aims to temper the initial influx of potential infections, balancing the need for epidemic control due to high traffic volume with maintaining overall mobility.

    "notes": "Virginia exhibits a moderately high average (E+I)/Population ratio (approximately 1.48%), making it the second-highest risk origin state. Its significant prevalence means that each traveler carries a higher probability of being exposed or infected. The quantitative logic for imported infections is `Imported_E_I ~ Flow * ft * (E_virginia + I_virginia) / Pop_virginia`. Consequently, a 'strict-first' pattern is applied, with lower fractions in the initial weeks (0.12, 0.15) that gradually rise. This policy is designed to reduce the immediate importation of cases from a state with considerable prevalence, thereby lessening the early burden on Arizona's healthcare capacity. The trade-off is a short-term reduction in mobility from Virginia in favor of a more controlled and manageable epidemic situation in Arizona. The fractions sum precisely to 1.00."

  "global_guidance": "The overarching strategy aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Arizona by strategically distributing the fixed total inbound flow over the next six weeks. This is achieved through cross-state reasoning, primarily by implementing 'strict-first' policies for origin states posing higher epidemiological risk. Mississippi and Virginia, with their significantly elevated (E+I)/Population ratios, are subjected to the most stringent early controls, deferring a larger proportion of their inbound traffic to later weeks. Texas, despite a lower prevalence, warrants a moderately strict-first approach due to its high inbound flow volume, which translates to a substantial absolute potential for imported infections. Conversely, New Mexico, with its exceptionally low risk profile, receives an 'even' distribution, maintaining consistent mobility without compromising Arizona's health objectives. This differentiated approach constitutes the quantitative cooperation logic, balancing the collective imported infection pressure over time. By reducing the influx of potential infections in the initial weeks, especially from high-risk sources, Arizona gains crucial time to manage its existing internal epidemic, flatten the curve of new infections, and potentially reduce peak healthcare demand. This strategy aims to prevent an early surge that could overwhelm local resources and lead to higher mortality. The recommendations are sensitive to future changes in origin states' prevalence. A significant reduction in a high-risk state's (E+I)/Population ratio might warrant a relaxation of early restrictions, while an increase in a low-risk state's prevalence would necessitate stricter early controls. Similarly, changes in Arizona's internal epidemic parameters, such as its `beta` value, would influence the urgency and severity of these policies; a higher `beta` would amplify the impact of imported infections, making early restrictions even more critical. The effectiveness is contingent on the accuracy of the provided ground truth flows and population compositions."
