States with higher (E+I+Q)/Population ratios (Mississippi, New Mexico) are subjected to stricter early-week controls to prevent immediate surges in Arizona's infection rates, given Arizona's current moderate internal prevalence. Conversely, states with lower prevalence (Texas) face less stringent restrictions, allowing for greater mobility. Virginia, with moderate risk, receives a balanced approach. This differential treatment ensures that resources for epidemic control in Arizona are not overwhelmed by high-risk imports, especially in the initial weeks, while maintaining essential mobility where risks are lower. 2. **Quantitative cooperation logic:** The core of this strategy is to balance the expected imported infection load across weeks and states. By using `Flow * ft * (E+I+Q)/Population` as the primary metric for potential imported cases, the policy distributes the total allowed flow (over 6 weeks) in a manner that minimizes the peak and cumulative imported cases. For high-risk states, `ft` is kept lower in early weeks to reduce the initial 'shock' of imported infections, effectively 'flattening the curve' of imported cases into Arizona. For lower-risk states, `ft` can be higher, as the `(E+I+Q)/Population` factor is already low. This cooperative logic ensures that while total flow remains constant, its temporal distribution minimizes the burden on Arizona's public health system. 3. **Sensitivity reasoning:** The effectiveness of this policy is sensitive to several factors. If the actual prevalence (E+I+Q)/Population in origin states significantly changes (e.g., a sudden outbreak in a low-risk state like Texas or a rapid decline in Mississippi), the `ft` allocations would need immediate re-evaluation. Similarly, if Arizona's internal `beta` (infection rate) or `alpha` (incubation rate) were higher than estimated, the impact of imported cases would be amplified, necessitating even stricter controls. Conversely, if Arizona's population develops higher immunity or if origin states implement more effective internal controls, the current `ft` values might be overly restrictive, allowing for more relaxed mobility without compromising control. The accuracy of the SEIQRD parameters and population compositions is crucial; any significant deviation could alter the optimal allocation strategy."

Mississippi currently has a significant internal prevalence ((E+I)/Pop ~ 0.00089), making it vulnerable to additional imported infections. The policy prioritizes a 'strict-first' approach for states posing the highest risk, calculated by multiplying their average daily inbound flow by their infection prevalence (E+I/Population). Virginia (2.00 daily potential imported E+I) and New Mexico (1.23) receive the most stringent initial controls, followed by Texas (1.08), which, despite its very low prevalence, poses a risk due to its high volume. Arizona (0.58), being the lowest risk, is assigned an even distribution to maintain consistent mobility. This quantitative cooperation logic ensures that states with a higher potential to introduce new cases face greater restrictions in the short term, allowing Mississippi to better manage its internal epidemic situation. By front-loading restrictions, we aim to 'buy time' and prevent an early surge in imported cases that could overwhelm local healthcare systems. This also provides flexibility for potential relaxation in later weeks if the epidemic situation in origin states or Mississippi improves. Sensitivity reasoning suggests that if prevalence in origin states significantly declines, these policies could be relaxed. Conversely, if Mississippi's internal transmission rate (beta = 0.1777) were higher, or its susceptible population (S = 2.97M) was even larger, the need for these strict initial controls would be further amplified, as imported cases would have a greater potential to trigger widespread local transmission and subsequent increases in confirmed cases and deaths."

This involves a differentiated approach based on each origin state's specific risk profile, primarily derived from its infectious prevalence ((E+I)/Population) and its baseline inbound flow. States exhibiting a higher combined 'infection pressure' ¨C calculated as the product of daily average flow and prevalence ¨C are subjected to stricter controls in the initial weeks (e.g., Arizona and Texas), manifesting as lower fractional allowances. This 'strict-first' pattern for high-risk states is critical for protecting New Mexico's currently susceptible population (S=2093484) from an early surge of imported infections. Conversely, states posing a lower infection pressure (e.g., Virginia) are managed with slightly more relaxed initial or evenly distributed controls, allowing for a balanced approach to mobility. This quantitative cooperation logic ensures that the collective risk of imported infections is spread over time and across origin states, preventing any single point of entry from overwhelming New Mexico's public health infrastructure. Such risk balancing is crucial for maintaining a manageable epidemic trajectory within the state. The sensitivity of these policies is significant: should the infectious prevalence in high-flow states like Texas unexpectedly increase, the current 'strict-first' measures would require immediate tightening or extension. Similarly, if New Mexico's internal reproductive number (driven by `beta`) were to rise, a more universally restrictive inbound policy would become imperative. Conversely, improved detection or recovery rates (`delta`, `gamma`) in New Mexico could allow for a gradual relaxation of these inbound controls."

This strategy aims to minimize the initial influx of potentially infectious individuals into Texas, thereby reducing the immediate burden on its healthcare system and allowing the state\'s inherently low effective R0 (0.176) to further reduce existing internal cases. By front-loading restrictions, we mitigate the risk of new local outbreaks triggered by imported cases, which could otherwise lead to exponential growth, despite Texas\'s favorable internal epidemic parameters.\n\nRisk balancing across states is achieved by differentiating the degree of initial strictness based on each origin state\'s estimated daily contribution of Exposed (E) and Infected (I) individuals. New Mexico, with the highest estimated daily import of E+I cases (approx. 71.24), receives the lowest initial flow fractions. Mississippi (approx. 28.20 E+I daily) is similarly restricted. Arizona (approx. 11.29 E+I daily) and Virginia (approx. 9.17 E+I daily) have slightly less stringent initial restrictions due to their lower absolute contributions to imported infections. This quantitative cooperation logic ensures that states posing the highest immediate risk are managed most cautiously, distributing the total fixed inbound flow over time to smooth out potential infection spikes.\n\nRegarding sensitivity, if the actual prevalence of E and I in origin states is higher than the 21-day average, or if Texas\'s true effective beta (and thus R0) is higher than calculated, the risk of imported infections triggering new waves would be amplified. In such scenarios, an even more aggressive "strict-first" approach, or even uniform low flow, might be necessary. Conversely, if origin states\' prevalence significantly drops or Texas\'s R0 remains very low and stable, a more uniformly distributed or even "relaxed-first" approach could be considered, provided the total imported infection load remains manageable. The current policy offers a conservative stance given the potential for imported cases to disrupt an otherwise stable internal epidemic.'

High-prevalence states (New Mexico, Mississippi) face "strict-first" policies, significantly reducing early inbound flow. This prevents an immediate surge of imported cases, aiding Virginia\'s internal epidemic management. Low-prevalence states (Texas) receive "even" allocations, recognizing their minimal risk and prioritizing uninterrupted mobility. Arizona, with moderate risk, has slightly front-loaded control. This differential approach targets the most impactful risk sources while maintaining regional connectivity where safe. Quantitative cooperation logic: The core principle distributes each state\'s fixed total inbound flow over six weeks to smooth or front-load potential imported infections. Assigning lower ft values to high-risk states in early weeks reduces Flow * ft * (I/Population), thus lowering the immediate influx of infected individuals. For instance, New Mexico and Mississippi\'s initial ft values (0.10) are substantially below the average (0.1667), reflecting a significant early reduction in potential imported cases. This early reduction from high-risk states is balanced by higher ft values in later weeks, maintaining the total 6-week flow. This ensures risk balancing across states and time. Sensitivity reasoning: Policy effectiveness is highly sensitive to origin state epidemiology. Increased \'I\' or \'E\' populations there would require stricter ft values. If Virginia\'s internal epidemic worsens, a more universally strict approach might be needed. Efficacy also relies on accurate, timely SEIQRD data; under-reporting in origin states underestimates risk. Finally, ft values balance health and mobility; any shift in Virginia\'s priorities would necessitate re-evaluation.'

States with a higher product of prevalence (I+E/Population) and total flow (e.g., Mississippi's ~405 potential I+E cases, New Mexico's ~340) are subjected to stricter initial controls. This approach prioritizes mitigating the largest potential sources of imported infections, safeguarding Arizona's currently low internal infection rates (I/Pop ~ 0.000058), preventing a rapid escalation of cases that could overwhelm local healthcare resources and lead to more deaths. For lower-risk states (e.g., Virginia's ~153 potential I+E cases, Texas's ~261), restrictions are less severe, balancing public health with essential mobility.\n\nThe policy employs a risk-balancing approach across both states and weeks. For higher-risk states, early week fractions (f1, f2) are significantly lower, reducing imported cases when Arizona is most vulnerable. These fractions are gradually increased, allowing Arizona's existing cases to resolve and its population to stabilize, thereby reducing the impact of later, higher flows. For states with lower overall risk, fractions are more evenly distributed, reflecting their lower potential to contribute to a significant outbreak. This ensures the cumulative inbound flow for each state over 6 weeks remains constant, respecting mobility baselines while optimizing public health outcomes.\n\nThe effectiveness of this policy is sensitive to several factors. If actual prevalence (I+E/Population) in origin states deviates significantly from 21-day averages, the estimated imported cases would change, potentially necessitating stricter or more relaxed controls. Similarly, fluctuations in Arizona's `beta` (infection rate) or `alpha` (E to I transition) would alter the state's capacity to absorb imported cases; a higher `beta` would demand stricter controls. Changes in `gamma` (recovery) and `mu` (death) rates in Arizona would affect the duration and severity of local outbreaks, influencing the acceptable level of imported risk. The policy assumes projected inbound flow remains consistent; significant deviations would require re-evaluation of weekly fractions to maintain the overall flow target while managing risk."

Therefore, the overarching strategy is to collectively minimize *additional* imported infections that could exacerbate the local epidemic. The policies are tailored based on each origin state's `Flow * (E+I)/Population` product, which quantifies the potential absolute imported infection risk. States with higher risk (Texas, Virginia) receive a stricter 'strict-first' allocation, while those with lower risk (Arizona, New Mexico) receive a comparatively less stringent, though still cautious, 'strict-first' or 'even' distribution. This differential approach ensures that the most impactful sources of imported infections are curtailed more aggressively in the initial weeks, when Mississippi is most vulnerable. 2. **Quantitative cooperation logic:** The 'strict-first' allocation pattern is a key component of the quantitative cooperation logic. By front-loading the restrictions (lower `ft` values in early weeks), the total number of imported infections is reduced during the critical initial period, allowing Mississippi more time to manage its internal spread. As weeks progress, the fractions gradually increase, reflecting an anticipation of either improved internal control in Mississippi or a more stable external situation. This temporal risk balancing across states aims to smooth the impact of inbound traffic on Mississippi's healthcare system and epidemic trajectory, preventing overwhelming surges. The total inbound flow for each state over 6 weeks remains constant, ensuring that the long-term economic and social ties are maintained, but the timing of this flow is optimized for epidemic control. 3. **Sensitivity reasoning:** The effectiveness of these policies is sensitive to several factors. If the actual prevalence (E+I)/Population in origin states is higher than the average used, or if Mississippi's internal `beta` (transmission rate) is higher than estimated, the imported infections could have a more significant impact, potentially necessitating even stricter initial controls. Conversely, if Mississippi's `beta` decreases rapidly due to interventions, or if origin states experience a sharp decline in prevalence, the policies could be relaxed sooner. The current high `beta` (0.1777) and high internal E+I in Mississippi suggest that any increase in imported cases will have a magnified effect, making the cautious 'strict-first' approach robust against potential underestimation of risk. Future adjustments would require re-evaluation of both internal and external epidemic trends."

This approach ensures that the total fixed inflow from each state is spread equally across the weekly periods. While the per-traveler infection risk (I/Pop) varies significantly among origin states (e.g., Mississippi's I/Pop is substantially higher than Arizona's), this strategy collectively minimizes cumulative infections and deaths in New Mexico by preventing concentrated surges of imported cases from *any* source in *any* single week. By smoothing out the influx of potential infections, New Mexico's internal epidemic control mechanisms are better able to manage a predictable and consistent level of external pressure. 2. **Quantitative cooperation logic**: The core principle is to balance the risk across both weeks and states by setting each weekly fraction (ft) to approximately 1/6 for all origin states. This means that for any given week t, the expected number of imported infections from a state `i` is `Flow_i * (1/6) * (I_i / Pop_i)`. By keeping `ft` constant, we ensure that the weekly imported infection rate from each state is proportional only to its total fixed flow and its inherent infection prevalence. This 'cooperation' ensures that no origin state's traffic allocation creates an unpredictable or overwhelming burden on New Mexico, thus contributing to the overall minimization of cumulative cases and deaths in the receiving state. It implicitly assumes that the average prevalence rates observed over the past 21 days will persist over the next 6 weeks. 3. **Sensitivity reasoning**: The effectiveness of this policy is sensitive to changes in the origin states' `I/Pop` prevalence. If a state's prevalence significantly increases in future weeks, the current even distribution might prove too relaxed for those weeks, potentially leading to higher imported infections than optimal. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, the policy might be overly strict. A dynamic policy responding to real-time prevalence trends would be more adaptive but is not feasible with the given static average data. New Mexico's own `beta` (0.111778) influences how quickly imported infections translate into local spread. A higher `beta` would make New Mexico more vulnerable, potentially requiring an even more cautious approach. The current policy assumes New Mexico's internal capacity can manage the consistent, averaged influx of risk."

This approach is based on the principle that delaying or reducing early infection introductions is critical, especially given Texas's current internal epidemic state (beta=0.128, indicating ongoing spread). Cross-state reasoning dictates that states posing a higher absolute potential for importing infections (calculated as `Flow * (I+E)/Population`) receive the most stringent initial restrictions. For instance, Mississippi, with the highest estimated daily imported cases (193.59), faces the tightest initial controls (f1=0.05). Conversely, Virginia, with the lowest estimated daily imported cases (16.70), has a comparatively less restrictive initial allocation (f1=0.12). This quantitative cooperation logic ensures that the total ground-truth flow for each state is distributed across six weeks in a manner that front-loads epidemic control efforts, thereby flattening the curve of imported cases and reducing the immediate burden on Texas's public health system. This strategy collectively reduces the aggregate number of new infection introductions, safeguarding Texas's population. Sensitivity reasoning suggests that the effectiveness of this policy is highly dependent on the accuracy of prevalence data from origin states and Texas's own `beta`. If origin state prevalence is higher than estimated, imported cases would be underestimated, necessitating even stricter early controls. Conversely, if Texas's `beta` were to increase significantly, indicating a faster internal spread, the urgency for stringent and potentially more prolonged border controls would intensify to prevent compounding local outbreaks. The current strategy is optimized for the provided data, aiming to provide a robust defense against external infection pressures."

By implementing stricter controls on states with higher infection pressure (Mississippi, Arizona, Texas) in the initial weeks, the policy aims to reduce the peak number of imported cases. This allows Virginia's public health infrastructure more time to manage its existing internal cases (E=7935, I=1865) without being overwhelmed by a sudden influx of external infections. States with lower risk (New Mexico) are given an even distribution to maintain mobility without significant epidemiological concern. The strategy balances the total imported risk (Flow * Prevalence) across states and weeks. Mississippi, with the highest product of flow and prevalence (18.401), receives the most stringent initial control. Arizona (3.465) and Texas (2.982), despite different underlying risk components (moderate prevalence/moderate flow vs. low prevalence/high flow), are treated similarly with slightly strict-first approaches due to their comparable overall imported risk levels. New Mexico (0.459) poses minimal risk, allowing for an even distribution. This risk-balancing ensures that the cumulative impact of imported infections is smoothed out over the 6-week period, preventing any single week or origin state from disproportionately contributing to Virginia's case count. The effectiveness of these policies is sensitive to several factors. If the actual prevalence (E+I)/Population in origin states significantly increases or decreases compared to the 21-day average, the calculated risk would change, potentially requiring adjustment of the 'ft' values. Similarly, if Virginia's internal transmission rate ('beta') or recovery rates shift, the optimal strategy for managing external risk might also need to be re-evaluated. A higher 'beta' in Virginia would make it more vulnerable to imported cases, warranting even stricter initial controls across the board."

Cross-state reasoning identifies Mississippi as the highest per-traveler risk due to its significantly elevated (E+I)/Population ratio. Consequently, a 'strict-first' approach is applied to Mississippi, front-loading restrictions to immediately curb potential high-prevalence imports and prevent an early surge in Arizona's caseload. In contrast, New Mexico and Texas, despite high inbound flows, exhibit very low (E+I)/Population ratios, posing minimal per-traveler risk. For these states, an 'even distribution' of traffic is adopted to maintain stable mobility without significantly increasing the epidemiological burden on Arizona. Virginia, with moderate prevalence but low flow, also receives an 'even distribution' to balance its moderate per-traveler risk with its limited overall impact. This collective approach strategically allocates mobility restrictions where the risk of imported infection is highest, while preserving mobility where the risk is manageable, thereby optimizing epidemic control efficiency across all origin states. The quantitative cooperation logic ensures that the product of `Flow * ft * (E+I)/Population` is managed across states and weeks to flatten the curve of potential imported infections. For Mississippi, lower `ft` in early weeks directly reduces this product during critical initial periods. For low-prevalence states, an even `ft` (approx. 1/6) distributes the minimal risk consistently. This prevents any single week from experiencing an undue influx of cases, particularly from high-risk sources, thus contributing to a more stable epidemic trajectory in Arizona. The policy's sensitivity is notable; significant changes in an origin state's (E+I)/Population prevalence or unexpected deviations in actual inbound flow from the ground truth averages would necessitate immediate re-evaluation and adjustment of the weekly fractions. For instance, a sharp increase in prevalence in Texas would require a shift from an 'even' to a 'strict-first' or more restrictive pattern to protect Arizona."

Given Mississippi's own relatively high S, E, and I populations, the objective is to prevent significant additional burden from external sources, especially from states with concerning epidemiological profiles. The policies differentiate based on the origin state's current and projected infection pressure. New Mexico, with its exceptionally low I/Pop and E/Pop, receives an even allocation, reflecting minimal risk. Texas, with moderate current infections but lower future risk (E/Pop), receives a moderately strict-first approach to mitigate immediate imports. Arizona, despite low current infections, has a higher E/Pop, warranting a stricter initial control to pre-empt future infections from its exposed population. Virginia, posing the highest risk with both high I/Pop and E/Pop, faces the most stringent early restrictions to drastically reduce both immediate and future imported cases, buying crucial time for Mississippi's public health system. This tiered approach ensures resources and restrictions are applied where the epidemiological impact is projected to be highest. The core principle is to balance the expected number of imported infections (`Flow * ft * (I/Pop)`) and exposed individuals (`Flow * ft * (E/Pop)`) across weeks and states. By implementing 'strict-first' policies for higher-risk states, we aim to reduce the cumulative integral of `Flow * ft * (I+E)/Pop` over the initial weeks. This front-loading of restrictions is particularly effective in containing exponential spread by reducing the initial 'seeds' of infection. The overall constant total flow for each state over 6 weeks (`sum(ft) = 1`) ensures that the policy manages the timing of flow rather than outright banning, thus balancing epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs. The effectiveness of these policies is sensitive to several factors. If the actual prevalence (I/Pop or E/Pop) in origin states deviates significantly from the 42-day averages, the predicted imported infections will change. For example, if Mississippi's internal control measures improve rapidly, the state might tolerate higher inbound flows. Conversely, if infection rates (beta) are higher than estimated, even small numbers of imported cases could have a larger impact. Regular re-evaluation of origin state data and Mississippi's internal epidemic status is crucial to adjust these allocations for optimal outcomes."

This is achieved through a differentiated, risk-based approach across origin states and a temporal distribution of traffic. Mississippi, identified as the highest-risk state due to its significantly elevated 'I' and 'E' prevalence, faces the most stringent initial restrictions. This critical measure prevents a rapid influx of infections that could overwhelm New Mexico's healthcare system. Conversely, Texas, with its lower 'E' prevalence, is subject to a more evenly distributed flow, acknowledging its lower immediate infection threat and its significant baseline flow. Arizona and Virginia, categorized as medium-risk, receive moderately strict-first allocations, balancing caution with the need to meet total flow requirements. This collective approach ensures that the most potent external threats are addressed first, optimizing the impact of control measures across all origin states.\n\nThe strategy involves a temporal risk balancing. By front-loading restrictions (lower `ft`) on higher-risk states in the initial weeks, the policy aims to 'flatten the curve' of imported infections. This provides New Mexico with valuable time to manage its own susceptible population and existing cases, preventing an immediate spike in 'E' and 'I' due to external factors. The formula `imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/population + E/population)` provides a framework for assessing the risk, where `I/population` represents immediate infectiousness and `E/population` represents future infectiousness. The goal is to avoid concentrating high-risk flows into early weeks, thereby smoothing the cumulative impact on New Mexico's SEIQRD dynamics.\n\nThe effectiveness of this policy is sensitive to several factors: 1) **Origin State Prevalence:** Significant changes in the 'I' and 'E' prevalence in origin states would necessitate a recalibration of `ft` fractions. 2) **New Mexico's Internal Epidemic:** A substantial increase in New Mexico's internal 'E' or 'I' populations, or a change in its `beta` parameter, would reduce its capacity to absorb imported cases, likely requiring more aggressive overall restrictions. 3) **Disease Characteristics:** Variations in the virus's transmissibility (`beta`), incubation period (`alpha`), or severity (`mu`) would alter the risk assessment. 4) **Data Accuracy:** The policy's robustness relies on the accuracy and timeliness of the SEIQRD data from origin states. Continuous monitoring of these parameters is crucial for optimal epidemic control."

This is achieved through a differentiated approach based on each state's current epidemic risk profile (E+I prevalence) and their total inbound flow to Texas. \n\n1. **Cross-state reasoning:** States with the highest risk (e.g., Mississippi, with its significantly higher E+I prevalence) are subjected to a 'strict-first' pattern, front-loading restrictions in early weeks. This critical measure prevents a rapid initial influx of infections, which could lead to exponential growth within Texas, thereby reducing the overall cumulative case count and fatalities. Conversely, states identified as low-risk (e.g., New Mexico, with very low prevalence despite high flow) are assigned an 'even' distribution, as their marginal contribution to imported infections is minimal, allowing for stable mobility. Moderate-risk states (Arizona, Virginia) receive a 'mild strict-first' approach, balancing early control with less severe mobility impacts. This collective strategy ensures that the most impactful sources of potential infection are mitigated earliest, while maintaining necessary mobility from lower-risk areas. \n\n2. **Quantitative cooperation logic:** The core principle is to balance the 'imported infection pressure' across the six-week period and among different origin states. The expected number of imported Exposed or Infected cases is directly proportional to `(Total Flow / 6 weeks) * ft * (E_origin + I_origin) / Population_origin`. By applying lower `ft` values (stricter control) in early weeks for high-risk states, we effectively reduce this crucial term when its impact on Texas's internal epidemic growth is most significant. This 'risk balancing' allows Texas to tolerate higher flows from lower-prevalence states or higher flows in later weeks, assuming the initial epidemic wave (if any) has been managed or the origin state's situation has improved. The total 6-week flow remains constant for each state, demonstrating a strategic redistribution of traffic over time rather than an outright elimination, thus preserving overall economic and social mobility benefits. \n\n3. **Sensitivity reasoning:** This policy's effectiveness is highly sensitive to the accuracy and timeliness of the origin states' E and I prevalence estimates. A rapid increase in prevalence in a currently low-risk state, or an underestimation of prevalence in a high-risk state, could quickly render the assigned 'even' or 'mild strict-first' patterns suboptimal. For instance, if New Mexico's prevalence were to surge, its 'even' distribution would need immediate reassessment towards a 'strict-first' approach. Similarly, the policy's impact is sensitive to Texas's internal SEIRD parameters; a higher internal transmission rate (beta) would amplify the effect of imported cases, necessitating even stricter early controls across all risk categories. Continuous monitoring of these epidemiological factors in both origin states and Texas is essential for dynamic adaptation and optimal policy performance."

States with significantly higher infection prevalence (e.g., Mississippi) face stricter initial controls, with gradually relaxing fractions over the 6-week period, assuming potential improvements in their situation or Virginia's increased resilience. Conversely, states with very low prevalence (e.g., New Mexico) are allowed relatively higher early mobility to support economic and social ties without undue risk to Virginia's public health. States with moderate risk (Arizona) or low risk but high traffic volume (Texas) receive a more balanced, gradually relaxing approach to manage their specific risk profiles effectively. This tailored approach aims to flatten the curve of imported cases, preventing overwhelming Virginia's healthcare system and supporting internal epidemic control efforts. Risk balancing is achieved both across states and across weeks. Across states, a higher `(E+I)/Population` in the origin state generally correlates with lower `ft` values, especially in early weeks, to reduce the initial influx of potentially infectious individuals. For states with high absolute flow (like Texas), even a low prevalence warrants a more conservative `ft` distribution to limit the total number of imported cases. Across weeks, the general trend is to be more stringent in earlier weeks when Virginia's susceptibility or current infection burden might be higher, and to gradually relax `ft` values in later weeks, anticipating potential improvements in disease control or increased population immunity, while always ensuring the total flow over 6 weeks remains constant for each origin. The recommended traffic policies are highly sensitive to changes in prevalence rates (`I/population` or `(E+I)/population`) in the origin states. If an origin state's prevalence significantly increases, its corresponding `ft` values would need to be reduced, particularly in early weeks, to prevent an surge of imported infections. Conversely, a substantial decrease in an origin state's prevalence could allow for more relaxed `ft` values. Similarly, if Virginia's internal transmission rate (`beta`) or current `E` and `I` populations were to rise sharply, a more conservative stance (lower overall `ft` values across all origin states) would be warranted to reduce additional external pressure on its epidemic control efforts. Regular monitoring of these epidemiological parameters is crucial for adaptive policy adjustments to maintain optimal epidemic control."

High-risk states (Mississippi: 37.52, Texas: 36.21) receive a "strict-first" mobility pattern, with lower fractions (e.g., 0.10, 0.12) in early weeks and higher fractions (e.g., 0.20, 0.22) in later weeks. This strategy aims to defer the fixed total imported infections, mitigating immediate epidemic surges in Arizona and allowing for better internal management or potential future improvements in prevalence. Conversely, lower-risk states (New Mexico: 5.80, Virginia: 5.54) are assigned an "even" distribution of flow across all six weeks (approx. 0.1667 per week). This balances consistent mobility with their inherently lower threat, as aggressive deferment is not critically needed. This collective strategy optimizes the temporal spread of imported risks, channeling higher-risk flows to later periods while maintaining stable, less impactful mobility from lower-risk regions.\n\nThe policy\'s efficacy is sensitive to several factors. Firstly, significant changes in the origin states\' `I/Population` ratios could alter their risk profiles, necessitating a re-evaluation of the `ft` distribution. Secondly, Arizona\'s internal epidemic trajectory (e.g., accelerating growth or declining cases) would influence the optimal timing for receiving imported cases; a worsening local situation would increase the need for stricter early controls across all sources. Thirdly, Arizona\'s `beta` (transmission rate) directly impacts how severely imported infections contribute to local spread; higher `beta` values would amplify the benefits of early restrictions. Finally, the accuracy of baseline flow data and public compliance are crucial for the policy to achieve its intended outcomes.'

States with higher prevalence of exposed and infected individuals (e.g., Virginia, Arizona) face stricter controls in early weeks, while lower-risk states (e.g., New Mexico) experience more consistent or slightly relaxed policies. Texas, despite moderate individual risk, receives careful management due to its significantly high inbound flow volume. This differential approach ensures that the most impactful sources of infection are addressed proactively, safeguarding Mississippi's population from undue strain. \n\nThe core principle of quantitative cooperation logic is to balance the product of (Flow * ft * (E+I)/Population) across all origin states and over the six-week period. By front-loading restrictions on high-risk states, we reduce the initial surge of imported cases, allowing Mississippi's healthcare system to better manage existing internal cases and reduce the probability of overwhelming spread. Conversely, by maintaining higher flow from low-risk states, we support essential mobility and economic activity without significantly increasing the epidemiological burden. The gradual relaxation for higher-risk states in later weeks assumes either an improving epidemiological situation in those states or a greater capacity/immunity within Mississippi over time. This dynamic allocation aims to smooth out the infection pressure, preventing spikes in cumulative cases and deaths.\n\nSensitivity reasoning highlights that the effectiveness of these policies is highly dependent on several factors. If the (E+I)/Population ratios in origin states change significantly, the allocation strategy would need immediate recalibration, potentially shifting restrictions. Similarly, if Mississippi's own S, E, I numbers rapidly increase, indicating a worsening local epidemic, a more universally strict inbound policy might be required. A higher effective transmission rate (beta) in Mississippi would mean that each imported infection has a greater potential to cause secondary cases, necessitating stricter controls overall. Conversely, a lower beta (due to vaccination or behavioral changes) could allow for more relaxed mobility policies."

States with high E/I ratios (Arizona, Mississippi, Virginia) are subject to 'strict-first' policies to preemptively reduce the influx of individuals who are likely to become infected soon, thereby flattening the curve of imported cases. Texas, despite a potentially declining trend (low E/I), receives a 'slightly strict-first then even' distribution due to its overwhelmingly large absolute traffic volume, which could otherwise introduce a significant number of infected individuals even with low prevalence. This differentiated approach acknowledges that both prevalence and absolute flow contribute to overall risk. 2. **Quantitative cooperation logic:** The distribution of flow fractions across weeks reflects a risk-balancing act. For states with high E/I, initial weeks are more restrictive (`lower ft`) to reduce the cumulative exposure during a period when their internal epidemics are likely to worsen. As time progresses, a slight relaxation (`higher ft`) is introduced, assuming either a stabilization of the epidemic in the origin state or an increased capacity for New Mexico to manage isolated cases. For Texas, the strategy maintains a more consistent, but still cautious, flow to manage its large volume. This ensures that the total allowed flow for each state remains constant over the 6 weeks as per the constraint, but the temporal distribution minimizes the peak burden on New Mexico's healthcare system and epidemic control resources. The goal is to smooth out the influx of potential infections rather than allowing large spikes. 3. **Sensitivity reasoning:** The proposed policy is sensitive to changes in prevalence and the `beta` parameter. If the actual prevalence (I/Pop, E/Pop) in origin states turns out to be higher than estimated, the imported infection rates would be higher, potentially requiring even stricter initial controls. Conversely, if `beta` (New Mexico's infection rate) were lower, the state might be able to tolerate slightly higher initial imported cases without a significant surge. If the E/I ratios for Arizona, Mississippi, and Virginia were to decline rapidly, a more 'even' or 'relaxed-first' approach could be considered for those states in future iterations. Similarly, if Texas's E/I ratio were to increase, indicating a resurgence, more aggressive 'strict-first' measures would be immediately necessary despite its large flow. The current policy assumes the observed 21-day averages and E/I ratios are indicative of the near future trend."

This is achieved by implementing a tiered approach based on the origin state's current infection pressure (I/Population). States with high infection rates (e.g., Mississippi) face significant initial restrictions, with their total allowed inflow heavily delayed to later weeks. This drastically reduces the immediate risk of importing a large number of infected individuals. Conversely, states with very low infection rates (e.g., New Mexico) experience minimal initial restrictions, allowing for a more consistent or slightly front-loaded flow, as their contribution to imported cases is expected to be negligible. Moderate-risk states (e.g., Virginia, Arizona) receive a moderately delayed flow, balancing control with mobility. This differential approach ensures that Texas allocates its limited control measures most effectively against the highest-risk sources, while maintaining necessary mobility where the risk is low. The core principle is to manage the total expected imported infections (sum_i(Flow_i * ft_i * (I_i/Pop_i))) into Texas over the 6-week period. By shifting the 'ft' (fraction of flow) for high-risk states to later weeks, we reduce the initial infection pressure on Texas. This 'flattens the curve' of imported cases, preventing an early surge that could overwhelm Texas's healthcare capacity and accelerate its internal epidemic spread. The fixed total flow constraint means that the overall number of potential imported infections remains constant per origin state, but by delaying them, we buy valuable time for Texas's own S, E, I, R, D dynamics to evolve more favorably (e.g., more people recover, or local control measures take effect), thereby reducing the impact of these later-arriving imported cases. This strategic timing across states and weeks is crucial for minimizing cumulative cases. These recommendations are highly sensitive to changes in the underlying epidemic conditions. If an origin state's I/Population significantly increases, its inbound flow fractions would need to become even more 'strict-first'. Conversely, if a high-risk state's I/Population drops substantially, its restrictions could be eased earlier. Similarly, if Texas's internal epidemic situation worsens (e.g., beta increases), then a more stringent 'strict-first' approach would be required for all origin states. The current recommendations assume that the past 21-day average I/Population provides a reasonable proxy for the immediate future risk, and that the primary goal remains minimizing cumulative cases and deaths. Any shift in these assumptions would necessitate a re-evaluation."

 policy={'arizona': [0.18, 0.17, 0.17, 0.16, 0.16, 0.16], 'mississippi': [0.1, 0.15, 0.15, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2], 'new mexico': [0.2, 0.2, 0.17, 0.15, 0.14, 0.14], 'texas': [0.15000000000000002, 0.15000000000000002, 0.15000000000000002, 0.20000000000000004, 0.20000000000000004, 0.1499999999999998]} explanation="The overarching strategy for Virginia's epidemic control and mobility policy is to proactively minimize the risk of imported infections by differentiating control measures based on the epidemic status and traffic volume of origin states. The primary objective is to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia. This is achieved through a risk-weighted approach, where the potential for imported infections (approximated by `Flow * ft * (I/Population)`) serves as the core quantitative metric.\n\nCross-state reasoning dictates that states with high infection pressure, either due to high prevalence (Mississippi) or high traffic volume (Texas), receive stricter initial controls ('strict-first' patterns). This front-loads the mitigation efforts, reducing the immediate influx of infected individuals during critical early weeks. Conversely, states with lower combined risk (Arizona, New Mexico) are allocated 'even' or 'relaxed-first' patterns, maintaining vital mobility without significantly jeopardizing Virginia's internal epidemic stability. This tailored approach avoids a blanket restriction that would unduly penalize low-risk states and hinder essential movement.\n\nQuantitative cooperation logic ensures risk balancing across weeks and states. For high-risk states, lower `ft` values in early weeks effectively reduce the `Flow * ft * (I/Pop)` term when it's most critical. The sum of fractions for each state is precisely 1.0, guaranteeing that the total ground truth inbound flow over six weeks remains constant, thereby balancing long-term mobility needs with short-term epidemic control. This allows for strategic temporal distribution of traffic, enabling Virginia to manage its resources more effectively.\n\nSensitivity reasoning highlights that the efficacy of these policies depends on the stability of origin state epidemic conditions and Virginia's own SEIQRD parameters. A sudden surge in an origin state's `I/Pop` would necessitate a re-evaluation and likely a stricter reallocation of `ft` values, particularly in early weeks. Similarly, significant changes in Virginia's `beta` (transmission rate) or `gamma` (recovery rate) would alter its susceptibility to imported infections, requiring adjustments to overall policy stringency. These recommendations are based on current data and assume these conditions remain relatively stable; continuous monitoring and adaptive policy adjustments are crucial for sustained success."

By implementing a "strict-first" approach for states with higher infection pressure (Mississippi, Virginia) or significant absolute imported infection potential (Texas), we aim to minimize the introduction of new cases when Arizona\'s own epidemic state (high E, moderate I) is most vulnerable. This early reduction in imported cases helps to flatten the curve of new infections, preventing overwhelming the healthcare system and ultimately reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases.\n\nThe quantitative cooperation logic revolves around minimizing the product of `Flow * ft * (I/Population_origin_state)`. States with a higher `I/Population` (like Mississippi) or a very high `Flow` (like Texas) are assigned lower `ft` values in the initial weeks, effectively reducing their contribution to imported infections when Arizona is most susceptible. As Arizona\'s internal epidemic situation might evolve or stabilize over the 6-week period, and internal control measures take effect, the `ft` values are gradually increased in later weeks for these higher-risk states. This strategy ensures that the overall imported infection burden is managed dynamically, with a strong emphasis on early prevention to leverage the non-linear dynamics of epidemic spread. The total flow from each state remains constant over the 6 weeks, reflecting a commitment to long-term mobility while optimizing its temporal distribution for public health.\n\nThe effectiveness of these policies is sensitive to several factors. If the actual prevalence (`I/Population`) in origin states varies significantly from the 21-day averages, the estimated imported infection risk will change, potentially requiring adjustment of `ft` values. For instance, a sudden surge in infections in a low-risk state like New Mexico would necessitate stricter controls. Similarly, variations in the disease transmission rate (`beta`) within Arizona would alter the impact of imported cases; a higher `beta` would make Arizona more sensitive to any imported infections, reinforcing the need for stricter early controls. The accuracy of other SEIQRD parameters (alpha, gamma, mu, delta) also influences Arizona\'s internal epidemic projection, which in turn informs the level of acceptable imported risk. Continuous monitoring of these parameters and real-time adjustments to flow fractions would be crucial for optimal control.'

States are prioritized based on their potential to import infections (Flow * I_proportion). High-risk states like Texas and Virginia, with substantial `I_proportion` and/or high inbound flow, are subject to 'strict-first' policies, significantly reducing traffic in the initial weeks. This front-loading of restrictions is crucial to prevent exacerbating Mississippi's current elevated Exposed (E=50576) and Infected (I=18158) populations, thereby flattening the curve of imported cases and reducing the overall strain on local healthcare resources. Conversely, lower-risk states like New Mexico receive an 'even distribution' to maintain consistent mobility without undue risk. This quantitative cooperation logic balances risk across weeks and states, ensuring that the total imported infection burden is minimized, particularly during Mississippi's critical early phase. For instance, Texas's high potential imported infections (33.62 daily) are reduced to ~3.36 in Week 1 by a 10percent flow, while New Mexico's low potential (0.35 daily) results in ~0.06 imported infections with a ~16.7percent flow, showcasing a risk-proportionate control. The policy's effectiveness is sensitive to changes in origin states' `I_proportion` and Mississippi's `beta` value. A surge in an origin state's prevalence would necessitate stricter or prolonged controls, while a decrease could allow for earlier relaxation. Similarly, a higher `beta` in Mississippi would demand more aggressive initial restrictions across all origins to prevent rapid local spread, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring and adaptive policy adjustments."

States with higher current infection (I) and exposed (E) prevalence, such as Mississippi and Virginia, are subjected to 'strict-first' policies, front-loading restrictions to limit immediate importation of cases. This reduces the initial burden on New Mexico's healthcare system and slows the introduction of new infection chains. Conversely, states with lower prevalence, like Arizona, are allocated a more 'even' flow, reflecting a lower immediate threat. Texas, with its large population and moderate prevalence, receives a 'slightly strict-first' approach to cautiously manage its significant baseline flow. This differential allocation ensures that the most impactful risks are addressed proactively, preventing an overwhelming influx of cases from high-prevalence areas while maintaining necessary mobility with lower-risk regions. 2. **Quantitative cooperation logic:** The risk balancing across weeks and states is rooted in the principle that `Expected Imported Infections ~ Inflow * ft * (I/Population)`. By assigning lower `ft` values to high-risk states in early weeks, the policy quantitatively reduces the expected number of imported infections during critical initial periods. For example, Mississippi's very high I/Pop (0.02311) means that even with its relatively low ground truth inflow (1434.48), a high `ft` would lead to many imported cases. Therefore, its `ft` values are the lowest initially (0.08). In contrast, Arizona's low I/Pop (0.0004373) allows for higher and more even `ft` values. This approach aims to flatten the curve of imported cases, distributing the total ground truth flow over time in a manner that minimizes peak infection pressure on New Mexico. The gradual increase in `ft` for high-risk states in later weeks assumes either an improvement in the origin state's epidemic situation or New Mexico's enhanced capacity to manage cases, balancing long-term mobility needs with sustained epidemic control. 3. **Sensitivity reasoning:** The effectiveness of these policies is sensitive to changes in prevalence and the `beta` parameter. If an origin state's `I` or `E` prevalence rises sharply unexpectedly, the current `ft` allocations might become insufficient, requiring immediate review and potentially stricter (lower `ft`) adjustments for subsequent weeks. Conversely, a significant drop in prevalence could allow for earlier relaxation. The `beta` value for New Mexico (0.111778) indicates a moderate infection rate; if `beta` were higher, New Mexico would be more susceptible to imported cases spreading rapidly, necessitating even stricter initial controls across all states. If `beta` were lower, there would be more leeway for relaxed `ft` values. Furthermore, the accuracy of the `I/Population` estimates is crucial; underreporting of cases would underestimate risk, leading to potentially inadequate restrictions. Regular monitoring of origin state epidemic data is essential for adapting these policies."

Cross-state reasoning: Mississippi is identified as the highest-risk origin due to its significantly elevated infection prevalence (I/Population). Consequently, it receives the most stringent 'strict-first' allocation, with minimal flow in early weeks to prevent a rapid surge of imported cases in Texas. Virginia and Arizona, presenting moderate to low-moderate risks, also adopt a 'strict-first' approach, albeit less aggressively than Mississippi, to create a protective buffer against their potential contributions to Texas's caseload. New Mexico, with the lowest infection prevalence, is assigned an 'even distribution' as its risk profile does not necessitate temporal adjustments to flow. This differentiated approach ensures that the state with the highest potential for seeding new infections is managed most aggressively upfront. Quantitative cooperation logic: This policy leverages the principle that early infections have a compounding effect within the SEIRD model. By reducing the initial inflow of infected individuals, especially from high-prevalence states like Mississippi (e.g., reducing potential imported infections from ~1411.7 daily to ~70.58 in week 1 via f1=0.05), the overall epidemic trajectory in Texas can be significantly flattened. The combined effect of these policies is to 'smooth out' the total imported infection load over the 6-week period, delaying and reducing peak influxes, thereby allowing Texas's internal healthcare system more time to adapt and respond. Sensitivity reasoning: This policy is sensitive to changes in origin states' prevalence. A sudden spike in 'I' or 'E' in a currently low-risk state (e.g., New Mexico) would necessitate an immediate re-evaluation and a shift towards a 'strict-first' policy for that state. Conversely, a sustained decline in prevalence across all states could warrant a more relaxed approach earlier. The policy also assumes a degree of stability in Texas's own epidemic parameters; a higher-than-expected internal transmission rate (beta) would magnify the impact of any imported infections, arguing for even stricter controls across the board. Furthermore, the effectiveness relies on accurate prevalence data and high compliance with mobility policies."

The core cross-state reasoning involves a tiered approach: severely restricting early flow from high-prevalence states (Mississippi) using a strict-first pattern, while relaxing initial controls for very low-prevalence states (New Mexico, Texas) via a relaxed-first pattern. States with moderate, lower-than-Virginia prevalence (Arizona) receive an even distribution to maintain stable mobility. This ensures that the most significant external infection pressures are contained promptly, while less risky travel is facilitated.\n\nThe quantitative cooperation logic focuses on minimizing the aggregate ¦² (Flow_i * ft_i * (I_i + E_i) / Pop_i) over all states and weeks. By front-loading restrictions on Mississippi, we prevent immediate, high-impact introductions. Conversely, front-loading allowances for New Mexico and Texas capitalizes on their low risk, supporting economic recovery without substantial epidemiological cost. This approach balances the state's total mobility requirements with critical epidemic control, preventing surges in imported cases.\n\nSensitivity reasoning highlights the dynamic nature of this policy. Its effectiveness hinges on the accuracy and stability of origin state prevalence data and Virginia's internal epidemiological parameters. Any significant increase in (I+E)/Population ratios in currently low-risk states would necessitate immediate policy adjustments towards stricter controls. Similarly, if Virginia's internal transmission rate (beta) were to rise, a more conservative approach across all origin states might be warranted. This policy assumes current trends will broadly continue for the next six weeks, but continuous monitoring and flexibility are crucial for adaptation."

This is achieved through cross-state reasoning, primarily by implementing 'strict-first' policies for origin states posing higher epidemiological risk. Mississippi and Virginia, with their significantly elevated (E+I)/Population ratios, are subjected to the most stringent early controls, deferring a larger proportion of their inbound traffic to later weeks. Texas, despite a lower prevalence, warrants a moderately strict-first approach due to its high inbound flow volume, which translates to a substantial absolute potential for imported infections. Conversely, New Mexico, with its exceptionally low risk profile, receives an 'even' distribution, maintaining consistent mobility without compromising Arizona's health objectives. This differentiated approach constitutes the quantitative cooperation logic, balancing the collective imported infection pressure over time. By reducing the influx of potential infections in the initial weeks, especially from high-risk sources, Arizona gains crucial time to manage its existing internal epidemic, flatten the curve of new infections, and potentially reduce peak healthcare demand. This strategy aims to prevent an early surge that could overwhelm local resources and lead to higher mortality. The recommendations are sensitive to future changes in origin states' prevalence. A significant reduction in a high-risk state's (E+I)/Population ratio might warrant a relaxation of early restrictions, while an increase in a low-risk state's prevalence would necessitate stricter early controls. Similarly, changes in Arizona's internal epidemic parameters, such as its `beta` value, would influence the urgency and severity of these policies; a higher `beta` would amplify the impact of imported infections, making early restrictions even more critical. The effectiveness is contingent on the accuracy of the provided ground truth flows and population compositions."

To collectively minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases, a consistent 'strict-first' traffic control policy is applied to all origin states. This strategy ensures that the highest level of inbound flow restriction occurs in the initial weeks (weeks 1-3), when Mississippi is most vulnerable to additional imported infections potentially fueling exponential growth. While the absolute number of imported infections will vary based on each origin state's total flow and prevalence, the pattern ensures an immediate and uniform reduction of risk from all external sources. This approach is particularly critical for high-volume states like Texas and high-prevalence states like Virginia and Arizona. 2. **Quantitative Cooperation Logic:** The uniform application of fractions [0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.25] across all origin states balances risk by front-loading control. This means that in weeks 1-3, only 30percent of the total 6-week flow is permitted from each state, significantly reducing the influx of potential carriers. The remaining 70percent is distributed over weeks 4-6, allowing for a gradual relaxation when the initial impact has been mitigated. This quantitative approach aims to minimize the area under the curve of new imported infections, thereby reducing the cumulative burden on Mississippi's public health system over the entire 6-week period. It prioritizes immediate epidemiological control over short-term mobility considerations. 3. **Sensitivity Reasoning:** The effectiveness of this policy is sensitive to several factors. If the prevalence of E and I in origin states were to significantly decrease or increase unexpectedly, the 'strict-first' pattern might need adjustment; for example, a rapid decline in origin state prevalence could allow for earlier relaxation. Conversely, a surge would necessitate sustained strictness. Similarly, Mississippi's internal transmission rate (beta) is crucial. A higher 'beta' would mean that each imported infection leads to more secondary cases, making stringent inbound control even more vital. If Mississippi's 'beta' were to decrease, the state might be able to tolerate a slightly higher inbound flow without as severe consequences. Continuous monitoring of these epidemiological parameters is essential for adaptive policy adjustments."

By distributing the total mandated flow uniformly over the next six weeks, this policy prevents large, unpredictable surges of potentially infected individuals from any single origin state. This approach is particularly critical given the varying and often significantly higher infection prevalence (I/TotalPop) in the origin states compared to New Mexico. For instance, Mississippi's I/TotalPop ratio is approximately 130 times higher than New Mexico's, while Virginia's and Texas's are approximately 6.7 and 4.7 times higher, respectively. Uniform distribution mitigates the risk of overwhelming New Mexico's healthcare system with concentrated imported cases. This policy leverages a risk-balancing principle across both time and origin states. For each state, expected imported infections are proportional to `Flow * ft * (I/population)`. By setting `ft` to be approximately 1/6 for all weeks and all states, we ensure that the weekly expected imported infections from each state are relatively constant: `expected_weekly_imported_infections ~ (TotalFlow_State / 6) * (I_State / TotalPop_State)`. This creates a predictable and manageable influx of risk, allowing New Mexico to better allocate resources for testing, contact tracing, and treatment. This approach implicitly assumes that the I/population ratio of each origin state will remain relatively stable over the 6-week period, as no future projections are provided. The effectiveness of this policy is sensitive to several factors. If an origin state's I/population ratio were projected to significantly increase in specific weeks, a 'strict-first' approach (lower ft in initial weeks) might be more effective. Conversely, if prevalence were projected to decrease, a 'relaxed-first' approach could be considered. If New Mexico's internal epidemic status (e.g., beta or I_ratio) were to rise sharply, even a stable influx of imported cases could trigger a larger internal epidemic, necessitating a more aggressive 'strict-first' approach. The policy also relies on the accuracy of the provided 21-day average SEIQRD values; continuous monitoring and potential recalibration of `ft` values would be crucial if real-time prevalence deviates significantly."

States with very high infection prevalence (e.g., Mississippi) or high potential for future surges (e.g., Arizona, Virginia due to high E counts) are assigned 'strict-first' patterns, front-loading mobility restrictions to reduce immediate importation risks. Conversely, states with very low prevalence (e.g., New Mexico) are given a 'relaxed-first' approach, allowing for greater early mobility when the per-capita risk of infection importation is minimal. This differential treatment ensures that resources and restrictions are applied where they are most impactful, preventing Texas from being overwhelmed by external infection pressure. The overall strategy aims to smooth out the total imported infection curve over the six weeks, rather than facing a sudden spike.\n\nThe core principle is `imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/Population_origin)`. By adjusting `ft` (weekly proportions), we aim to shift the burden of imported infections away from periods when an origin state's `I/Population` is high, or when Texas's own internal epidemic might be more vulnerable. For instance, Mississippi's extremely high `I/Population` dictates very low `ft` in early weeks, effectively 'buying time' for Texas. New Mexico, despite its high absolute flow, has a very low `I/Population`, allowing for higher `ft` values earlier, thereby distributing the overall mobility more efficiently. This creates a risk-balanced portfolio of inbound traffic, where the combined contribution of imported infections from all states is managed to stay within Texas's capacity, while respecting the constant total flow for each origin state.\n\n The effectiveness of these policies is highly sensitive to the accuracy of the SEIQRD parameters and the future trajectory of the epidemic in origin states. If the `I` or `E` populations in 'strict-first' states (e.g., Mississippi, Virginia, Arizona) do not decrease as implicitly hoped for in later weeks, then the increasing `ft` values could lead to a higher-than-desired influx of infected individuals. Conversely, if `I` or `E` in 'relaxed-first' states (e.g., New Mexico) unexpectedly surge, the early relaxation of `ft` could exacerbate Texas's case counts. The model assumes a relatively stable `I/Population` for the 21-day average, but real-time data would be crucial for adaptive adjustments. Furthermore, the `beta` (infection rate) in Texas could influence its capacity to absorb imported cases; a higher `beta` would necessitate even stricter controls across the board, while a lower `beta` might allow for more flexibility."

The core principle is to proportionally restrict inbound traffic from states with higher current infection prevalence (E+I)/Population. Mississippi, with its exceptionally high (E+I) ratio (0.1853), receives the strictest initial controls to delay the arrival of potentially numerous infectious individuals. Arizona, with moderate risk (0.0143), also faces a progressively strict-first approach, albeit less aggressively. Conversely, states with very low risk, such as New Mexico (0.00201) and Texas (0.0032), are treated with more relaxed or even distributions, recognizing their minimal contribution to imported infection risk. This differentiated approach ensures that the most impactful sources of infection are managed proactively, while mobility from lower-risk areas is less hindered.\nThe risk balancing across weeks and states is achieved by allocating the fixed total inbound flow for each state over six weeks. For high-risk states like Mississippi, a 'strict-first' allocation (e.g., 10percent in week 1, increasing to 25percent in week 6) shifts the bulk of potential imported infections to later weeks. This 'buys time' for Virginia's healthcare system to recover or adapt, and for the origin state's epidemic situation to potentially improve. For states with lower and more manageable risks, such as Texas (even distribution) and New Mexico (relaxed-first), the policy supports consistent or even slightly increased initial mobility, as the expected number of imported infections (`Flow * ft * (E+I)/Population`) remains low enough not to overwhelm Virginia's resources, even with higher initial `ft` values. This cooperative logic ensures that the overall burden of imported cases on Virginia is smoothed out and reduced during critical early phases.\n The effectiveness of these policies is sensitive to several factors. Firstly, changes in the true prevalence (E+I)/Population in origin states over the next six weeks would alter the optimal allocation; if a low-risk state experiences a surge, its policy might need to shift to 'strict-first.' Secondly, variations in Virginia's own epidemic trajectory (e.g., changes in beta or alpha) would influence its capacity to absorb imported cases; a worsening local situation might necessitate stricter controls across all origin states. Thirdly, the accuracy of the flow data and population composition estimates is crucial. If the actual flow or prevalence is significantly different, the calculated imported infection risk will be inaccurate. Therefore, continuous monitoring of epidemiological data in both Virginia and origin states is essential for adaptive policy adjustments."
