New Mexico's high prevalence means each unit of flow carries a higher risk of introducing an infected individual. Pattern justification: A \"strict-first\" pattern is applied. This strategy targets the high per-capita risk by significantly reducing early inbound flow, thereby preventing a surge of imported cases into Virginia during critical initial weeks.

This indicates a very low risk of imported infections per traveler. Quantitative logic: Expected imported infections are proportional to Flow * ft * (I/Population). Due to Texas's very low prevalence, even its substantial flow contributes minimally to imported infection risk. Pattern justification: An \"even\" distribution pattern is recommended. There is no strong epidemiological basis to restrict early flow from such a low-risk source, thus maintaining consistent mobility is prioritized. Trade-offs: This policy prioritizes maintaining stable mobility and economic activity due to the negligible epidemiological risk, accepting a consistent baseline flow without significant control measures.

Low-prevalence states (Texas) receive \"even\" allocations, recognizing their minimal risk and prioritizing uninterrupted mobility. Arizona, with moderate risk, has slightly front-loaded control. This differential approach targets the most impactful risk sources while maintaining regional connectivity where safe. Quantitative cooperation logic: The core principle distributes each state's fixed total inbound flow over six weeks to smooth or front-load potential imported infections. Assigning lower ft values to high-risk states in early weeks reduces Flow * ft * (I/Population), thus lowering the immediate influx of infected individuals. For instance, New Mexico and Mississippi's initial ft values (0.10) are substantially below the average (0.1667), reflecting a significant early reduction in potential imported cases. This early reduction from high-risk states is balanced by higher ft values in later weeks, maintaining the total 6-week flow. This ensures risk balancing across states and time. Sensitivity reasoning: Policy effectiveness is highly sensitive to origin state epidemiology. Increased 'I' or 'E' populations there would require stricter ft values. If Virginia's internal epidemic worsens, a more universally strict approach might be needed. Efficacy also relies on accurate, timely SEIQRD data; under-reporting in origin states underestimates risk.

This poses a substantial risk of seeding new infections within Virginia. Expected imported infections are directly proportional to Flow * ft * (E+I)/Population.

This suggests a moderate, but manageable, risk of importing new infections. 2. Quantitative logic: The expected number of imported infections from Arizona is proportional to `Arizona_Flow * ft * (Arizona_I/Arizona_Population)`. Its moderate prevalence suggests a need for a cautious approach, especially in early weeks, to minimize imported cases. 3. Pattern choice: A \"gradual relaxation with a slight dip at the end\" pattern is applied. Initial weeks have slightly lower fractions (0.1500, 0.1600) to cautiously manage the moderate infection risk. Fractions then increase in mid-weeks (up to 0.1800) before a slight decrease in the final week (0.1600), reflecting an adaptive management approach based on potential evolving conditions. 4. Trade-offs: This policy seeks a middle ground, allowing for increased mobility over time as Virginia's internal situation or Arizona's prevalence might change, while maintaining initial caution to limit immediate risks to public health. 5.

This indicates a substantial risk of importing new infections into Virginia. 2. Quantitative logic: The expected number of imported infections from Mississippi is proportional to `Mississippi_Flow * ft * (Mississippi_I/Mississippi_Population)`. Given Mississippi's high infection rate, even a moderate `ft` could lead to a significant number of imported cases. 3. Pattern choice: A \"strict-first, gradually relaxed\" pattern is chosen. The lowest fractions are allocated to the initial weeks (0.1000, 0.1200) to minimize early introduction of high-prevalence infections, buying time for Virginia's internal control efforts.

This suggests a minimal risk of importing infections. 2. Quantitative logic: The expected number of imported infections from New Mexico is proportional to `NewMexico_Flow * ft * (NewMexico_I/NewMexico_Population)`. Due to its very low infection rate, even higher `ft` values are expected to result in fewer imported infections compared to other states. 3. Pattern choice: A \"relaxed-first\" pattern is adopted, with higher fractions in the initial weeks (0.1800, 0.1750) to facilitate early mobility. This approach leverages the low risk from New Mexico, then slightly tightens before a slight rebound, ensuring overall mobility while maintaining vigilance. 4.

However, Texas has the highest absolute daily inbound flow to Virginia among all origin states. 2. Quantitative logic: While Texas's prevalence is low, the large volume of traffic means that `Texas_Flow * ft * (Texas_I/Texas_Population)` could still contribute a non-negligible number of imported infections. Therefore, careful management of `ft` is essential despite the low rate. 3. Pattern choice: A \"gradually relaxed and then stable\" pattern is implemented. Fractions start at a moderate level (0.1600) and slightly increase over the weeks (up to 0.1700), then stabilize, aiming to manage the high volume of traffic by gradually easing restrictions. This balances the low prevalence with the high absolute flow. 4. Trade-offs: This strategy attempts to balance the benefit of sustained mobility from a large source state with the need to prevent even a small infection rate from becoming significant due to high traffic volume, thus protecting public health. 5.

  "global_guidance": "The collective strategy prioritizes minimizing overall cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia by dynamically allocating inbound traffic based on the origin states' current epidemiological risk and traffic volume. States with significantly higher infection prevalence (e.g., Mississippi) face stricter initial controls, with gradually relaxing fractions over the 6-week period, assuming potential improvements in their situation or Virginia's increased resilience. Conversely, states with very low prevalence (e.g., New Mexico) are allowed relatively higher early mobility to support economic and social ties without undue risk to Virginia's public health. States with moderate risk (Arizona) or low risk but high traffic volume (Texas) receive a more balanced, gradually relaxing approach to manage their specific risk profiles effectively. This tailored approach aims to flatten the curve of imported cases, preventing overwhelming Virginia's healthcare system and supporting internal epidemic control efforts. Risk balancing is achieved both across states and across weeks. Across states, a higher `(E+I)/Population` in the origin state generally correlates with lower `ft` values, especially in early weeks, to reduce the initial influx of potentially infectious individuals. For states with high absolute flow (like Texas), even a low prevalence warrants a more conservative `ft` distribution to limit the total number of imported cases. Across weeks, the general trend is to be more stringent in earlier weeks when Virginia's susceptibility or current infection burden might be higher, and to gradually relax `ft` values in later weeks, anticipating potential improvements in disease control or increased population immunity, while always ensuring the total flow over 6 weeks remains constant for each origin. The recommended traffic policies are highly sensitive to changes in prevalence rates (`I/population` or `(E+I)/population`) in the origin states. If an origin state's prevalence significantly increases, its corresponding `ft` values would need to be reduced, particularly in early weeks, to prevent an surge of imported infections. Conversely, a substantial decrease in an origin state's prevalence could allow for more relaxed `ft` values. Similarly, if Virginia's internal transmission rate (`beta`) or current `E` and `I` populations were to rise sharply, a more conservative stance (lower overall `ft` values across all origin states) would be warranted to reduce additional external pressure on its epidemic control efforts.

This indicates a minimal risk of importing infections. Quantitatively, imported infections are low, proportional to Flow * ft * (I+E)/Population_NewMexico. Therefore, a relaxed-first pattern is adopted, allowing higher inbound flow in earlier weeks. This policy prioritizes mobility and economic benefits due to the negligible epidemic risk. The trade-off strongly favors economic activity, with minimal compromise on epidemic control. The fractions [0.25, 0.20, 0.18, 0.15, 0.12, 0.10] sum exactly to 1.00000, confirming the allocation."

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound allocation strategy is designed to minimize imported infections and mitigate cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia by dynamically managing risks from various origin states. The core cross-state reasoning involves a tiered approach: severely restricting early flow from high-prevalence states (Mississippi) using a strict-first pattern, while relaxing initial controls for very low-prevalence states (New Mexico, Texas) via a relaxed-first pattern. States with moderate, lower-than-Virginia prevalence (Arizona) receive an even distribution to maintain stable mobility. This ensures that the most significant external infection pressures are contained promptly, while less risky travel is facilitated.\n\nThe quantitative cooperation logic focuses on minimizing the aggregate  (Flow_i * ft_i * (I_i + E_i) / Pop_i) over all states and weeks. By front-loading restrictions on Mississippi, we prevent immediate, high-impact introductions. Conversely, front-loading allowances for New Mexico and Texas capitalizes on their low risk, supporting economic recovery without substantial epidemiological cost. This approach balances the state's total mobility requirements with critical epidemic control, preventing surges in imported cases.\n\nSensitivity reasoning highlights the dynamic nature of this policy. Its effectiveness hinges on the accuracy and stability of origin state prevalence data and Virginia's internal epidemiological parameters. Any significant increase in (I+E)/Population ratios in currently low-risk states would necessitate immediate policy adjustments towards stricter controls. Similarly, if Virginia's internal transmission rate (beta) were to rise, a more conservative approach across all origin states might be warranted. This policy assumes current trends will broadly continue for the next six weeks, but continuous monitoring and flexibility are crucial for adaptation."

    "notes": "Arizona exhibits a moderate risk level with an (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 1.43% (129,701 infected/exposed out of 9,048,916 total). The relatively high number of Exposed individuals (121,724) suggests potential for future case growth. Expected imported infections are estimated by `Flow * ft * (E+I)/Population`. A 'progressive strict-first' pattern is recommended to slightly defer potential infections. This approach initially restricts a larger portion of inbound traffic in earlier weeks, gradually relaxing towards the end of the 6-week period, aiming to provide Virginia's healthcare system more time to manage its current caseload. This strategy balances epidemic control by reducing immediate infection pressure with maintaining overall mobility. The sum of fractions is 0.14 + 0.15 + 0.16 + 0.17 + 0.18 + 0.20 = 1.00."

    "notes": "Mississippi presents an extremely high risk, with an (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 18.53% (145,803 infected/exposed out of 786,754 total). This high prevalence suggests a severe and active epidemic, making it the highest threat for importing infections into Virginia. Given this exceptionally high (E+I) ratio, even a moderate daily flow (4887.67) can lead to a substantial number of imported infections (`Flow * ft * (E+I)/Population`). A 'strict-first' pattern is adopted, significantly reducing inbound traffic in the initial weeks and progressively increasing it over time. This delays and minimizes the immediate impact of highly infectious travelers on Virginia's healthcare system, prioritizing public health over immediate mobility.

Its low prevalence and relatively low daily flow (2362.71) mean the expected number of imported infections (`Flow * ft * (E+I)/Population`) will be minimal.

While higher than New Mexico, it's significantly lower than Arizona or Mississippi. Despite a very high daily inbound flow (25141.14), Texas's low (E+I) ratio means the proportion of infected travelers is low, resulting in moderate absolute imported infections (`Flow * ft * (E+I)/Population`). An 'even' distribution is chosen to maintain a consistent level of inbound traffic across all six weeks. Given the low prevalence, this approach avoids unnecessary fluctuations in mobility, supporting economic and social ties while ensuring a predictable and manageable influx of travelers for Virginia's public health resources.

  "global_guidance": "The collective strategy aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia by strategically managing imported infections from diverse origin states. The core principle is to proportionally restrict inbound traffic from states with higher current infection prevalence (E+I)/Population. Mississippi, with its exceptionally high (E+I) ratio (0.1853), receives the strictest initial controls to delay the arrival of potentially numerous infectious individuals. Arizona, with moderate risk (0.0143), also faces a progressively strict-first approach, albeit less aggressively. Conversely, states with very low risk, such as New Mexico (0.00201) and Texas (0.0032), are treated with more relaxed or even distributions, recognizing their minimal contribution to imported infection risk. This differentiated approach ensures that the most impactful sources of infection are managed proactively, while mobility from lower-risk areas is less hindered.\nThe risk balancing across weeks and states is achieved by allocating the fixed total inbound flow for each state over six weeks. For high-risk states like Mississippi, a 'strict-first' allocation (e.g., 10% in week 1, increasing to 25% in week 6) shifts the bulk of potential imported infections to later weeks. This 'buys time' for Virginia's healthcare system to recover or adapt, and for the origin state's epidemic situation to potentially improve. For states with lower and more manageable risks, such as Texas (even distribution) and New Mexico (relaxed-first), the policy supports consistent or even slightly increased initial mobility, as the expected number of imported infections (`Flow * ft * (E+I)/Population`) remains low enough not to overwhelm Virginia's resources, even with higher initial `ft` values. This cooperative logic ensures that the overall burden of imported cases on Virginia is smoothed out and reduced during critical early phases.\n The effectiveness of these policies is sensitive to several factors. Firstly, changes in the true prevalence (E+I)/Population in origin states over the next six weeks would alter the optimal allocation; if a low-risk state experiences a surge, its policy might need to shift to 'strict-first.' Secondly, variations in Virginia's own epidemic trajectory (e.g., changes in beta or alpha) would influence its capacity to absorb imported cases; a worsening local situation might necessitate stricter controls across all origin states. Thirdly, the accuracy of the flow data and population composition estimates is crucial. If the actual flow or prevalence is significantly different, the calculated imported infection risk will be inaccurate. Therefore, continuous monitoring of epidemiological data in both Virginia and origin states is essential for adaptive policy adjustments."
