  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic policies are designed to strategically minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in New Mexico over the next six weeks, leveraging New Mexico's current low infection rates (I=189, E=842) as a protective baseline. The core strategy involves a differentiated approach based on each origin state's absolute potential for importing infections, calculated as the product of its baseline inbound flow and its current infected prevalence (I/Population). This quantitative logic ensures that states posing the highest risk, whether due to high prevalence or high volume, receive the most stringent early controls. \n\n**Cross-state reasoning and quantitative cooperation logic:** Texas, despite its relatively low prevalence, presents the highest absolute risk due to its massive inbound flow (12.69 potential imported infections daily), necessitating the most stringent early controls (8% of total flow in week 1). Mississippi, with its significantly high prevalence, also requires a strict-first approach (3.18 potential imported infections daily), albeit slightly less restrictive in early weeks than Texas, reflecting its lower total flow but higher per-capita risk. Arizona, with moderate flow and prevalence similar to New Mexico's (1.12 potential imported infections daily), receives a moderately strict-first approach, balancing caution with consistent mobility. Virginia, having the lowest flow and moderate prevalence (0.21 potential imported infections daily), is deemed the lowest risk contributor and thus receives a more evenly distributed, slightly increasing flow. This coordinated staggering of inbound traffic across states, with higher-risk states experiencing greater early restrictions, aims to prevent an initial overwhelming surge of cases in New Mexico, distributing potential imported infections over time and reducing the peak burden on the state's healthcare system. By front-loading restrictions for the riskiest flows, we protect New Mexico's current favorable epidemic status. \n\n**Sensitivity reasoning:** The effectiveness of these policies is highly sensitive to changes in several factors. If the prevalence (I/Population) in origin states significantly decreases over the six-week period, a more relaxed-first or evenly distributed policy could be considered for future periods, as the risk of imported infections would diminish. Conversely, an increase in prevalence in any origin state would necessitate an immediate tightening of controls, potentially shifting towards even stricter 'strict-first' patterns or even reducing total allocated flow if possible, to maintain the control over `Flow * ft * (I/population)`. New Mexico's internal transmission rate (beta) is also critical; a higher beta (currently 0.1118) would mean even a small number of imported cases could trigger a rapid local outbreak, demanding even more aggressive inbound controls. The current policies assume a relatively stable situation in origin states for the immediate future and New Mexico's current beta allows for some managed influx, but any deviation requires swift re-evaluation to maintain the primary objective of minimizing cumulative cases and deaths."

While its 'I' (877) is not excessively high, its 'E' (13267) and 'Q' (18439) suggest a significant number of active or incubating cases. The high 'R' (13783) indicates a considerable past burden, but 'D' (2081) is also notable. The ratio of I to S is relatively low, but the E population indicates potential for future infections. \n2. **Quantitative logic**: Imported infected individuals from Arizona can be estimated as `Flow * ft * (I_arizona / Population_arizona)`. Given the high inbound flow from Arizona, even a moderate prevalence can lead to substantial imported cases. \n3. **Pattern**: A 'strict-first, then gradually relaxed' pattern is adopted. The first two weeks are slightly more restrictive (0.15, 0.16) to mitigate immediate import risk from the current E/I burden. Subsequently, fractions gradually increase as New Mexico's own population dynamics might allow for more external interaction, assuming a stable or improving trend in Arizona. This front-loads control to reduce initial spread when New Mexico's current 'I' is relatively low. \n4. **Trade-offs**: This strategy balances immediate epidemic control by reducing initial traffic against maintaining mobility for economic and social reasons in later weeks.

Its 'E' (28442) and 'I' (13577) are exceptionally high relative to its population (2.08M), indicating widespread active transmission and a large pool of incubating cases. The 'Q' (7958) is also significant. This suggests a high prevalence of infection, making inbound travelers from Mississippi particularly likely to carry the virus. \n2. **Quantitative logic**: The number of imported infected individuals will be significantly influenced by `Flow * ft * (E_mississippi + I_mississippi) / Population_mississippi`. Due to the high E and I values, the risk per traveler is substantial, even with a lower total flow. \n3. **Pattern**: A 'strict-first, gradually relaxed' pattern is implemented. The initial weeks (0.14, 0.15) are more restrictive to aggressively curb imported infections from a state with very high prevalence. This is crucial for protecting New Mexico given its own low current 'I' count. The fractions increase in later weeks, assuming the initial strictness allows for better internal control and potential improvement in Mississippi's situation, or at least a better understanding of the disease trajectory. \n4. **Trade-offs**: This policy prioritizes epidemic control over mobility in the short term due to Mississippi's high infection pressure. The significant reduction in initial flow is a trade-off for potentially fewer imported cases and a slower introduction of new variants. \n5. **Validation**: 0.1400 + 0.1500 + 0.1600 + 0.1800 + 0.1850 + 0.1850 = 1.0000."

The 'Q' (41360) and 'R' (115490) are very high, indicating a large number of past and active confirmed cases. The large 'S' population means ample susceptible individuals for continued spread. \n2. **Quantitative logic**: Given Texas's large population and high total flow, imported cases can be estimated as `Flow * ft * (I_texas / Population_texas)`. Even a small infection rate translates to many potential imported cases due to the high volume of travelers. \n3. **Pattern**: A 'mildly strict-first, then generally even' pattern is chosen. The first two weeks (0.175, 0.165) are slightly more restrictive than an even distribution, reflecting the immediate risk from a large neighbor with significant internal spread and a high baseline flow.

The early weeks (0.16, 0.165) are slightly lower than an even split, providing a minor initial buffer against imported cases, especially considering New Mexico's own low internal 'I' count. This is followed by a more balanced allocation across subsequent weeks, as the overall inbound flow from Virginia is the lowest among the origin states. \n4. **Trade-offs**: Given the lower inbound flow from Virginia, the policy can afford to be more balanced between control and mobility.

This 'strict-first' approach is designed to reduce the immediate influx of infected individuals when New Mexico's own 'I' count is relatively low (469), thereby protecting its susceptible population and preventing a rapid escalation of internal spread. For states with very high total flow (e.g., Texas), even a low per-capita infection rate can translate to a high number of imported cases, warranting a careful, slightly front-loaded control.

The initial weeks (Week 1-2) generally see lower fractions for all states, reflecting a collective effort to reduce the overall imported viral load into New Mexico. This 'front-loading' of control is critical because New Mexico's 'S' population is very high (5.2M), making it vulnerable to new introductions.

If the 'beta' (infection rate) in New Mexico were higher, meaning the virus spreads more easily internally, then the need for stricter inbound control across all states would be paramount, as imported cases would quickly lead to larger local outbreaks.

Due to this high infection pressure, a 'strict-first' approach is adopted, with the lowest initial fractions to severely restrict early-week traffic. This aims to minimize the introduction of new cases when the prevalence in Mississippi is likely highest.

    "notes": "1. **Risk interpretation**: Arizona exhibits a moderate proportion of Exposed (E=122311) and Infected (I=7980) individuals within its population (approx 9.2M), leading to an (I+E) prevalence of about 1.42%. This indicates a notable risk of disease transmission. 2. **Quantitative logic**: Expected imported infections are estimated as Inflow * (I+E)/Population, which for Arizona translates to approximately 24321.9 * 0.01416 = 344.4 potential infections imported over the 6-week period if flow were evenly distributed. 3. **Pattern choice**: A 'strict-first, then gradually relaxing' pattern is chosen. This prioritizes tighter control in the initial weeks to minimize immediate viral introduction into new mexico, allowing new mexico's public health system to adapt and manage its internal dynamics. The gradual relaxation acknowledges the fixed total flow and aims for a smoother transition. 4. **Trade-offs**: This policy balances the need for stringent early epidemic control against the societal and economic demands for mobility. By front-loading control, the policy aims to mitigate the initial infection pressure, potentially allowing for more relaxed measures later if the situation stabilizes, while still accommodating the full baseline flow. 5. **Validation**: The sum of fractions [0.150 + 0.160 + 0.170 + 0.170 + 0.175 + 0.175] equals 1.000, ensuring the total inbound flow remains constant as per the ground truth."

    "notes": "1. **Risk interpretation**: Mississippi presents a significantly high proportion of Exposed (E=108199) and Infected (I=45109) individuals relative to its smaller population (approx 0.81M), resulting in an alarming (I+E) prevalence of about 18.82%. This indicates a very high risk of infection per traveler. 2. **Quantitative logic**: Despite a lower total inbound flow, the extremely high prevalence means that imported infections are estimated at 1410.24 * 0.18818 = 265.4 over the 6 weeks. Each traveler from Mississippi carries a substantially higher individual risk of being infected or exposed. 3. **Pattern choice**: A 'strict-first, then slightly relaxing' pattern is adopted. Given the exceptionally high prevalence, initial weeks are kept very tight to minimize the introduction of highly probable infections. The slightly higher fractions in later weeks still reflect a cautious approach, recognizing the persistent high per-traveler risk. 4. **Trade-offs**: The primary trade-off here is between aggressive epidemic mitigation due to extreme prevalence and maintaining some level of mobility. The policy prioritizes public health by restricting early high-risk entries, accepting the constraint of fixed total mobility but distributing it carefully to reduce cumulative risk. 5. **Validation**: The sum of fractions [0.150 + 0.150 + 0.160 + 0.180 + 0.180 + 0.180] equals 1.000, ensuring the total inbound flow remains constant."

    "notes": "1. **Risk interpretation**: Texas has a relatively low proportion of Exposed (E=26366) and Infected (I=44872) individuals within its large population (approx 22.15M), leading to an (I+E) prevalence of about 0.32%. However, its sheer population size and high mobility to new mexico amplify its risk. 2. **Quantitative logic**: Despite low prevalence, Texas's massive inbound flow results in the highest estimated imported infections: 139917.52 * 0.00321 = 449.2 over the 6 weeks. This high absolute number makes it the top contributor to potential imported cases. 3. **Pattern choice**: A 'strictest-first, then gradually relaxing' pattern is implemented. Due to the highest potential for absolute imported infections, the earliest weeks are subject to the tightest control to prevent a large initial surge that could overwhelm new mexico's healthcare system and accelerate local transmission. 4. **Trade-offs**: This policy makes a clear trade-off by significantly curbing initial mobility from Texas to protect new mexico from a large influx of potential infections, despite Texas's lower per-capita risk. This prioritizes the minimization of cumulative cases and deaths in new mexico over an even distribution of mobility, acknowledging the high volume of traffic. 5. **Validation**: The sum of fractions [0.140 + 0.150 + 0.170 + 0.180 + 0.180 + 0.180] equals 1.000, ensuring the total inbound flow remains constant."

    "notes": "1. **Risk interpretation**: Virginia shows moderate proportions of Exposed (E=108056) and Infected (I=25959) individuals within its population (approx 8.99M), with an (I+E) prevalence of about 1.49%. This risk level is comparable to Arizona on a per-capita basis. 2. **Quantitative logic**: Due to its significantly lower inbound flow compared to other states, Virginia has the lowest estimated imported infections: 1327.76 * 0.01491 = 19.8 over the 6 weeks. This makes it the least impactful source of external infections. 3. **Pattern choice**: An 'even distribution with slight early control' pattern is chosen. Given the minimal overall risk contribution, a more balanced approach is feasible. The slightly lower fractions in early weeks still provide a minor buffer, but the overall distribution is less restrictive than for higher-risk states. 4. **Trade-offs**: With Virginia posing the lowest threat, the policy allows for a more consistent and less disruptive mobility pattern, balancing necessary public health caution with reduced economic and social friction. The trade-off leans towards accommodating mobility more readily due to the lower epidemiological impact. 5. **Validation**: The sum of fractions [0.160 + 0.160 + 0.170 + 0.170 + 0.170 + 0.170] equals 1.000, ensuring the total inbound flow remains constant."

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound allocations are designed to strategically reduce the expected number of imported infections and, consequently, minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in new mexico. The core principle is to implement stricter controls (lower fractions) for states that pose a higher immediate risk, considering both their disease prevalence (I+E/Population) and the volume of inbound traffic. For instance, Texas, despite its lower prevalence, receives the strictest initial control due to its massive flow, which translates to the highest absolute number of potential imported cases. Conversely, Mississippi, with its extremely high prevalence, also faces tight early restrictions, even with lower total flow, because each traveler represents a significant risk. Arizona, with moderate prevalence and high flow, also sees early restrictions. Virginia, being the lowest risk, is managed with a more even distribution. This differentiated approach ensures that the most impactful sources of potential infection are addressed proactively. The policy balances risk across weeks and states. For higher-risk states like Texas, Arizona, and Mississippi, a 'strict-first' approach is adopted, meaning a higher proportion of the total flow is deferred to later weeks. This front-loads the control, reducing the immediate influx of potential infections into new mexico. This strategy aims to flatten the curve of imported cases, giving new mexico's healthcare system more time to manage its internal epidemic dynamics (e.g., reducing its own E and I populations). By pushing more traffic to later weeks, there's an implicit assumption that new mexico's internal situation might improve, or that later weeks might offer better testing/quarantine capabilities. The total inbound flow for each state remains constant over the 6 weeks, ensuring that the economic and social functions tied to mobility are eventually met, but with an optimized temporal distribution to minimize public health impact. The effectiveness of these policies is sensitive to several factors. If the actual prevalence (I+E) in origin states is higher than estimated from the 21-day averages, the expected number of imported infections would be greater, necessitating even stricter initial controls. Conversely, if prevalence is lower, some early restrictions could potentially be eased. Similarly, variations in new mexico's internal transmission rate (beta) or its healthcare capacity (influenced by delta) would alter the optimal strategy. A higher beta in new mexico would mean imported cases spread faster, demanding even tighter border controls. If new mexico's delta (quarantine rate) were lower, internal spread from imported cases would be harder to contain, making proactive border control even more critical. These fractions are based on current data and assume stable epidemiological parameters; significant shifts would require re-evaluation and adjustment of the weekly allocations."
