    "notes": "1. Risk interpretation: Arizona exhibits a relatively low prevalence of infection with an average (I+E)/Pop ratio of approximately 0.000400, which is lower than Mississippi's own current prevalence. The counts of Exposed (E=1952) and Infected (I=962) individuals suggest a manageable level of active cases within their population. 2. Quantitative logic: The expected number of imported infections from Arizona is estimated by the product of its inbound flow, the weekly fraction, and its (I+E)/Pop ratio. Given its lower prevalence, the absolute number of imported cases per week is anticipated to be relatively low. 3. Pattern: An 'even' distribution of flow across the six weeks is adopted. This strategy aims to distribute the potential import of infections uniformly over time, preventing any single week from experiencing an undue burden, which is prudent given the stable, albeit lower, risk profile. 4. Trade-offs: This policy balances consistent epidemic control by avoiding sudden influxes with maintaining predictable mobility for economic and social stability. It leverages Arizona's lower risk to allow for a steady flow. 5. Validation: The sum of fractions 0.166666 + 0.166667 + 0.166667 + 0.166667 + 0.166667 + 0.166666 equals 1.000000."

    "notes": "1. Risk interpretation: New Mexico presents a notable infection risk, with an (I+E)/Pop ratio of approximately 0.000998, which is higher than Mississippi's current prevalence. The significant numbers of Exposed (E=816) and Infected (I=1276) individuals relative to its population indicate an active and potentially spreading epidemic within the state. 2. Quantitative logic: The expected imported infections are proportional to `Flow * ft * (I_origin / Population_origin)`. Despite its lower total inbound flow compared to Texas, New Mexico's higher prevalence means each traveler carries a greater risk of being infected, resulting in a higher risk-per-flow product. 3. Pattern: An 'even' distribution of flow is recommended. While New Mexico poses a higher infection risk, in the absence of specific trend forecasts, an even distribution ensures that any potential imported cases are spread consistently over the 6 weeks, preventing weekly peaks that could overwhelm Mississippi's public health resources. 4. Trade-offs: This policy seeks to consistently manage the higher health risk from New Mexico by spreading it evenly, without resorting to overly restrictive measures that would severely impact mobility and associated economic activities. 5. Validation: The sum of fractions 0.166666 + 0.166667 + 0.166667 + 0.166667 + 0.166667 + 0.166666 equals 1.000000."

    "notes": "1. Risk interpretation: Texas currently exhibits an exceptionally low infection prevalence, with an (I+E)/Pop ratio of approximately 0.000043. This is significantly lower than Mississippi's own prevalence and other origin states, indicating a very low per-capita risk of infection. 2. Quantitative logic: Despite Texas having the highest daily inbound flow to Mississippi, its very low infection prevalence implies that the expected number of imported infections (`Flow * ft * (I_origin / Population_origin)`) will be relatively low in absolute terms, contributing moderately to Mississippi's overall imported case count. 3. Pattern: An 'even' distribution is chosen. Given the very low infection risk from Texas, maintaining a consistent, high volume of traffic evenly across the 6 weeks is the most balanced approach. This strategy supports essential mobility while the low prevalence effectively minimizes the risk of imported cases. 4. Trade-offs: This policy prioritizes facilitating high-volume mobility and economic activity with minimal epidemic risk, leveraging the favorable epidemiological situation in Texas. The even flow provides predictability for both travelers and public health management. 5. Validation: The sum of fractions 0.166666 + 0.166667 + 0.166667 + 0.166667 + 0.166667 + 0.166666 equals 1.000000."

    "notes": "1. Risk interpretation: Virginia shows a significant infection risk, with an (I+E)/Pop ratio of approximately 0.000587, which is comparable to Mississippi's own prevalence. The high counts of Infected (I=3189) and Exposed (E=1825) individuals suggest a substantial potential for exporting cases. 2. Quantitative logic: Virginia, with its considerable inbound flow and high prevalence, represents the highest overall 'risk score' (Flow * (I+E)/Pop) among the origin states. The expected imported infections (`Flow * ft * (I_origin / Population_origin)`) are therefore a primary concern, requiring careful management to mitigate impact on Mississippi. 3. Pattern: An 'even' distribution of flow is chosen. Despite the high risk, in the absence of specific trend forecasts, an even distribution of flow across the 6 weeks helps to manage the consistent potential for imported cases without creating sudden peaks that could strain Mississippi's healthcare system. 4. Trade-offs: This approach balances the significant public health risk from Virginia with the practical need to maintain some level of mobility. Distributing the risk evenly helps in sustained management rather than reactive responses to fluctuating flow. 5. Validation: The sum of fractions 0.166666 + 0.166667 + 0.166667 + 0.166667 + 0.166667 + 0.166666 equals 1.000000."

  "global_guidance": "1. Cross-state reasoning: The overarching goal of these inbound traffic allocations is to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Mississippi. By analyzing the (I+E)/Pop ratios and inbound flow volumes for each origin state, we established a risk profile. States like New Mexico and Virginia, despite having lower absolute inbound flows than Texas, present a higher per-traveler infection risk due to their higher prevalence. Texas, conversely, has the highest flow but a very low per-traveler risk, while Arizona falls in between. The consistent 'even' distribution pattern chosen for all states aims to uniformly spread the potential for imported cases over the six-week period. This strategy prevents any single week from experiencing an unmanageable surge from any particular origin, thereby helping to stabilize Mississippi's internal epidemic management and reduce the likelihood of overwhelming its healthcare system. \n2. Quantitative cooperation logic: The core principle is to manage the expected number of imported infections, which is approximated as `daily_flow * ft * (I_origin / Population_origin)`. By setting `ft` to approximately 1/6 for all weeks and states, we ensure that the total potential imported infection load from each state is distributed as evenly as possible over the 6-week horizon. This approach avoids concentrating risk in specific weeks, which could lead to an increased local transmission rate (beta) in Mississippi due to heightened exposure. This strategy implicitly assumes that Mississippi's capacity to handle new cases remains constant, and that the prevalence in origin states remains stable. This approach prioritizes a predictable and manageable influx of potential cases, allowing Mississippi's existing SEIQRDP dynamics to adapt without sudden shocks. \n3. Sensitivity reasoning: The efficacy of these recommendations is highly sensitive to changes in the underlying epidemiological parameters, particularly the prevalence (`I/Population`) in origin states and Mississippi's own transmissibility (`beta`). If an origin state's `I/Population` were to significantly increase, the current even distribution might prove insufficient, leading to a higher than expected number of imported cases. In such a scenario, a 'strict-first' approach (shifting flow to later weeks with assumed improvement) or progressively stricter weekly controls would be warranted for that specific state, if allowed by the constant total flow constraint. Conversely, if an origin state's prevalence were to significantly decrease, a 'relaxed-first' approach could be considered to boost mobility. Similarly, if Mississippi's `beta` were to rise, indicating increased internal transmission, while direct modification of total flow is not allowed here, it would necessitate more stringent internal non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to cope with the existing and imported case load. These recommendations are based on current average conditions and would require immediate re-evaluation if these epidemiological parameters change significantly."

    "notes": "1. **Risk Interpretation:** Arizona has a relatively low 'I' count (877) but a high 'Q' count (18439) and a substantial 'D' count (2081). The high 'Q' count suggests effective case identification but also a significant burden of confirmed cases. The low 'I' relative to 'Q' might indicate a lag in reporting or effective isolation post-confirmation. The population is large (S=8.2M). 2. **Quantitative Logic:** Expected imported infections are proportional to `Flow * ft * (I / Population)`. Given Arizona's moderate 'I' count, we aim to manage imported risk. 3. **Pattern:** A 'strict-first' pattern is adopted to front-load control, gradually relaxing over the 6 weeks. This mitigates immediate infection import risk while observing trends. The initial higher 'I' prevalence in Mississippi itself suggests caution. 4. **Trade-offs:** This strategy balances immediate epidemic control by limiting initial inbound flow with the need to gradually restore mobility. The reduction in early weeks helps reduce the peak impact on Mississippi's healthcare system. 5. **Validation:** 0.18 + 0.17 + 0.17 + 0.16 + 0.16 + 0.16 = 1.00."

The 'D' count is also low (103). This indicates a well-controlled or less active outbreak. 2. **Quantitative Logic:** The number of imported infected individuals is approximated by `Flow * ft * (I / Population)`. Due to New Mexico's low 'I' prevalence, the imported risk is inherently lower. 3. **Pattern:** A 'relaxed-first' approach (or rather, less strict initially, then gradually increasing flow) is suitable here. Given the low current infection pressure, we can afford to allow slightly higher flow in later weeks, assuming Mississippi's internal situation improves or stabilizes. The initial lower fractions are still a precaution. 4. **Trade-offs:** This policy prioritizes mobility from a lower-risk state, acknowledging the economic and social benefits of travel, while maintaining a cautious stance by not fully front-loading flow. 5. **Validation:** 0.15 + 0.15 + 0.16 + 0.18 + 0.18 + 0.18 = 1.00."

The relatively high 'I' count suggests a notable risk of importing active cases. 3. **Pattern:** A moderately 'strict-first' approach is chosen, aiming for a consistent reduction in flow during the initial weeks to mitigate immediate risk, followed by slight relaxation.

The S/population ratio is high, indicating a large susceptible pool. The infected population (I=1932) is moderate relative to its total population. The average inflow from Arizona is low compared to other states like Texas. 2. **Quantitative logic:** Expected imported infections are estimated as `Flow * ft * (I / Population)`. Given Arizona's moderate I and Q values, a slightly relaxed control in later weeks is adopted, anticipating some stabilization or decline in Mississippi's internal epidemic if early control measures are effective. 3. **Pattern:** A 'relaxed-first' approach (or rather, a gradually increasing flow) is chosen. While the 'I' count is moderate, the 'Q' count is high, suggesting potential for undetected spread. However, given the low total inflow, a slight increase over time is deemed acceptable, allowing for initial containment efforts in Mississippi to take effect. 4. **Trade-offs:** This policy balances the need for early precaution with the desire to facilitate mobility as the situation potentially stabilizes. The low overall flow from Arizona means even small adjustments in fractions have limited impact on total imported risk, but also limited economic benefit. 5. **Validation:** The sum of fractions is 0.15 + 0.16 + 0.17 + 0.17 + 0.17 + 0.18 = 1.00."

Given Texas's high 'I' and 'Q' counts and the largest inbound flow, even small changes in 'ft' have a significant impact on imported cases. 3. **Pattern:** A 'relaxed-first' pattern, with gradually increasing flow, is adopted. This prioritizes stricter control in the initial weeks when Mississippi's internal epidemic might be more vulnerable, and then gradually relaxes as internal control measures are hopefully established. 4. **Trade-offs:** This strategy directly addresses the primary source of imported risk.

    "notes": "1. Risk interpretation: Arizona exhibits a moderate level of infection prevalence with an (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.71%. While not the highest, this still presents a notable risk for importing exposed and infected individuals into Mississippi, which currently has a significantly higher internal E+I proportion (~8.5%). The confirmed (Q) and recovered (R) numbers are substantial, indicating a past significant outbreak. 2. Quantitative logic: Expected imported infections are proportional to the daily inbound flow, the weekly fraction (ft), and Arizona's current (E+I)/Population ratio. Specifically, imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (E_arizona + I_arizona) / Pop_arizona. To minimize these introductions, early restrictions are advised. 3. Pattern: A \"strict-first\" pattern is adopted. This strategy significantly limits inbound traffic in the initial weeks, progressively relaxing controls over time. This aims to reduce the immediate influx of potential infections, allowing Mississippi more time to manage its own high internal case load and potentially for Arizona's prevalence to decline. 4. Trade-offs: This strict-first approach prioritizes epidemic control over immediate mobility. While it restricts early travel and its associated economic benefits, it is expected to reduce the burden on Mississippi's healthcare system and minimize cumulative cases and deaths by delaying potential new introductions from a state with moderate risk. 5. Validation: The sum of the fractions [0.0800 + 0.1200 + 0.1800 + 0.2000 + 0.2100 + 0.2100] is exactly 1.0000."

    "notes": "1. Risk interpretation: New Mexico presents the lowest infection risk among the origin states, with an (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.115%. Its E, I, Q, R, and D numbers are relatively low compared to its population size, suggesting a more controlled epidemic situation. This makes it a less critical source of imported infections for Mississippi. 2. Quantitative logic: Imported infections are estimated as imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (E_new_mexico + I_new_mexico) / Pop_new_mexico. Due to New Mexico's low prevalence, the absolute number of imported cases per unit of flow is expected to be low. 3. Pattern: A \"gradually relaxed\" pattern is chosen. While still slightly restrictive in the first weeks compared to an even distribution, it allows for a smoother, less abrupt increase in mobility. This balances the low risk from New Mexico with Mississippi's general need to minimize any new introductions given its own high E+I. 4. Trade-offs: This policy strikes a balance by maintaining some early caution while acknowledging New Mexico's low epidemiological risk. It allows for a more consistent flow of mobility compared to stricter policies, potentially supporting economic activity without significantly compromising Mississippi's epidemic control efforts. 5.

    "notes": "1. Risk interpretation: Texas has a relatively low (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.151%, similar to New Mexico's low prevalence. However, Texas's total inbound flow to Mississippi is by far the largest among all origin states. This means that even with low individual risk, the sheer volume of travelers could result in a significant absolute number of imported infections. 2. Quantitative logic: Imported infections are a function of the substantial daily inbound flow, the weekly fraction (ft), and Texas's (E+I)/Population ratio: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (E_texas + I_texas) / Pop_texas. The high Flow term necessitates careful management despite the low prevalence. 3. Pattern: A \"slightly strict-first\" pattern is applied. This pattern aims to moderately restrict early traffic, preventing a large initial spike in potential imported cases, which is crucial given the high baseline flow. It then allows for increased mobility in later weeks. 4. Trade-offs: This policy balances the low per-capita risk from Texas with the high absolute volume of traffic. While strict initial control might impact early economic interaction, it is a necessary measure to mitigate the risk of importing a large quantity of infections that could strain Mississippi's healthcare system, especially considering Mississippi's own high internal E+I. 5.

    "notes": "1. Risk interpretation: Virginia presents the highest immediate risk among the origin states, with an (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.90%. This indicates a higher prevalence of active and incubating cases within its population. Importing individuals from Virginia, therefore, carries a greater potential for contributing to Mississippi's already significant internal epidemic burden. 2. Quantitative logic: The expected number of imported infections is directly proportional to the inbound flow, the weekly fraction (ft), and Virginia's elevated (E+I)/Population ratio: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (E_virginia + I_virginia) / Pop_virginia. The higher prevalence factor makes early restriction particularly important. 3. Pattern: A \"highly strict-first\" pattern is implemented. This policy is designed to severely limit inbound traffic in the initial weeks, with a gradual relaxation over the 6-week period. This aggressive front-loading of restrictions is justified by Virginia's higher infection pressure, aiming to protect Mississippi from additional disease introduction during its vulnerable period. 4. Trade-offs: This policy heavily prioritizes epidemic control over mobility in the short term. While it will significantly curtail early travel and associated economic activity from Virginia, it is deemed necessary to minimize the influx of infections from a high-risk source, thereby reducing the strain on Mississippi's healthcare system and ultimately mitigating cumulative cases and deaths. 5.

  "global_guidance": "The overarching strategy for inbound traffic control into Mississippi is designed to collectively minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases, especially given Mississippi's current high internal prevalence of exposed and infected individuals (~8.5% E+I). The policy adopts a nuanced approach, differentiating control levels based on the origin state's infection risk and the absolute volume of potential inbound traffic.\n\nCross-state reasoning: States with higher (E+I)/Population ratios (Virginia at ~0.90%, Arizona at ~0.71%) are subjected to stricter \"strict-first\" policies. This front-loads restrictions, severely limiting early inbound flow when the risk of importing new infections is highest. This allows Mississippi's internal epidemic to potentially subside or for healthcare resources to be better mobilized before significant external introductions occur. For states with lower prevalence (Texas at ~0.15%, New Mexico at ~0.115%), the policies are less stringent, but still generally adopt a \"slightly strict-first\" or \"gradually relaxed\" approach. This is particularly important for Texas, which, despite low prevalence, has a massive inbound flow, meaning even a small proportion of infected travelers could lead to a large absolute number of imported cases. By varying the strictness, the policy aims to allocate the fixed total inbound flow over 6 weeks in a way that minimizes the \"infection pressure wave\" hitting Mississippi.\n\nQuantitative cooperation logic: The objective is to manage the total expected imported infections (Sum over states and weeks [Flow_state * ft_week * (E_state + I_state) / Pop_state]) to keep it as low as possible, especially in early weeks. The chosen fractions for each state collectively work to defer a significant portion of total inbound mobility from higher-risk sources to later weeks. This temporal distribution of risk helps smooth out the potential impact, preventing early surges that could overwhelm Mississippi's already burdened system. For instance, the very low initial fractions for Virginia and Arizona directly reduce the number of high-risk individuals entering Mississippi when its own population is most vulnerable. The aggregate effect of these policies across all states is a collective reduction in early imported cases, providing a critical buffer for Mississippi.\n\nSensitivity reasoning: The effectiveness of these recommendations is sensitive to several factors. If the actual prevalence (E+I) in origin states were to increase significantly beyond the 21-day averages, the current \"strict-first\" policies might need to be even more aggressive, with lower initial fractions for all states. Conversely, if origin state prevalence drops sharply, some early restrictions could be relaxed. Similarly, if Mississippi's internal transmission rate (beta) were higher, the state would be more susceptible to imported infections, necessitating even stricter and more prolonged controls across all origin states. If Mississippi's own E+I numbers were to decrease substantially, it could tolerate a more relaxed-first or even distribution of traffic from lower-risk states. The policy assumes that Mississippi's internal epidemic dynamics will allow for some reduction in its own E+I over the 6-week period, making later weeks safer for increased inbound mobility. Any changes in these underlying epidemiological parameters would require a re-evaluation of the weekly traffic allocations."
