A 'strict-first' pattern, slightly less restrictive than for Mississippi or Texas, is chosen. This approach cautiously limits early mobility to manage potential infection importations, while gradually relaxing controls as the weeks progress.

High-risk states like Mississippi (high prevalence) and Texas (high flow, moderate prevalence) are subjected to 'strict-first' policies, front-loading mobility restrictions to curb the immediate importation of Exposed and Infected individuals. This reduces the initial infection pressure on Arizona, which is currently managing its own significant number of active cases (I=1062, Q=22033). Conversely, New Mexico, identified as a low-risk origin due to its very low prevalence, is given an 'even' allocation, prioritizing sustained mobility where public health risk is minimal. Virginia, presenting a moderate risk, receives a moderately 'strict-first' approach. This quantitative cooperation logic balances public health imperatives with mobility needs by allocating stricter controls when and where the risk of imported infections (proportional to Flow * ft * (E+I)/Population) is highest, particularly in the critical early weeks. The fixed total inbound flow over 6 weeks for each state ensures a baseline level of economic activity is maintained. Sensitivity analysis suggests that this policy would adapt if prevalence rates in origin states change; for instance, a significant increase in E+I in New Mexico would necessitate a shift towards a 'strict-first' approach for that state. Similarly, if Arizona's internal transmission rate (beta) were to increase, a more stringent 'strict-first' policy across all states would be advisable to prevent exponential growth."

    "notes": "Mississippi shows a high 'I' count (45109) and 'E' count (108199) relative to its population, indicating a significant active infection and exposure risk. The 'Q' count (31083) is also high, suggesting a substantial number of confirmed cases. The high 'I' and 'E' values suggest a high risk of imported infections. Therefore, a 'strict-first' approach is adopted, with higher restrictions in early weeks (lower fractions) to minimize initial importation, gradually relaxing as the situation is monitored. This aims to reduce cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Arizona by limiting the initial influx of potentially infected individuals. The fractions sum to 1.0000, ensuring the total flow over 6 weeks remains constant while prioritizing early epidemic control. The trade-off is reduced immediate mobility from Mississippi for better long-term health outcomes in Arizona."

    "notes": "New Mexico presents a relatively low 'I' (3214) and 'E' (14121) count compared to its large 'S' population, suggesting a lower immediate infection pressure than other states. The 'Q' count (34170) is moderate. Given the lower current infection risk, a 'relaxed-first' approach is less critical, but a gradual increase in flow is still prudent. We start with slightly stricter control and gradually relax the fractions over the 6 weeks, assuming the lower infection rates persist or improve. This allows for a steady increase in mobility while keeping an eye on potential changes. Imported infections are expected to be lower due to the smaller (I/population) ratio. The sum of fractions is 1.0000, balancing mobility needs with a cautious approach to disease spread. The trade-off is a slight initial restriction for sustained lower risk."

    "notes": "Texas has a very high 'I' count (44872) and a significant 'E' count (26366), along with a high 'Q' count (221493), indicating a substantial and active epidemic. Despite its large population, the absolute numbers are concerning. Given the high baseline flow, the potential for imported infections (Flow * ft * I/population) is considerable. A 'strict-first' policy is implemented, with higher restrictions in the initial weeks (lower fractions) to mitigate the immediate risk of importing a large number of infected individuals. This strategy prioritizes minimizing the burden on Arizona's healthcare system. The fractions sum to 1.0000, ensuring total flow is maintained while front-loading control measures. The trade-off is a temporary reduction in mobility from a major neighboring state for critical epidemic control."

    "notes": "Virginia shows a considerable 'I' count (25959) and 'E' count (108056), similar to Mississippi in terms of infection pressure relative to population, although with a lower absolute flow. The 'Q' count (171251) is also high. This indicates a moderate to high risk of imported infections. An 'even' approach with a slight initial restriction and then stabilization is chosen. This aims to maintain a consistent level of control without drastic fluctuations. The goal is to prevent a surge in imported cases while allowing for a predictable flow. The fractions sum to 1.0000. This balances the need for epidemic control with maintaining a reasonable level of mobility, acknowledging Virginia's significant infection numbers but lower inbound flow compared to Texas."

  "global_guidance": "The collective strategy aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Arizona by selectively adjusting inbound traffic from origin states based on their current epidemic severity and projected infection pressure. For states with high 'I' and 'E' counts (e.g., Mississippi, Texas, Virginia), a 'strict-first' or slightly restricted initial approach is adopted. This front-loads control measures in early weeks (lower f1, f2) to reduce the immediate influx of potentially infected individuals, leveraging the fact that early infections have a compounding effect. For states with lower prevalence (e.g., New Mexico), a more balanced or gradually relaxed approach is used, acknowledging a lower immediate risk. Quantitative cooperation logic is applied by understanding that imported_infected_cases = Total_Flow * ft * (I/Population_origin_state). By reducing 'ft' in early weeks for high-risk states, we effectively reduce the 'imported_infected_cases' when Arizona's own 'S' population is still high. The goal is to flatten the curve of imported infections, preventing a rapid increase in Arizona's 'I' and 'Q' counts. This risk balancing across weeks and states ensures that the total allowed flow for each state over 6 weeks remains constant, respecting baseline mobility needs, while strategically distributing the flow to mitigate peak infection risks. Sensitivity reasoning suggests that if actual prevalence (I/Population) in origin states turns out to be higher than estimated, or if the transmission rate (beta) within Arizona is higher, the current 'strict-first' policies might need to be even more stringent to maintain the same level of control. Conversely, if prevalence drops significantly, more relaxed policies could be adopted earlier. The fractions are carefully chosen to sum to 1.0000 for each state, ensuring compliance with the total flow constraint while optimizing for public health outcomes in Arizona."
