The 'Q' count (3319) is higher than 'I', indicating active case identification. Given Virginia's current 'I' population (3189), imported infections from Arizona, though not extremely high, could contribute. We aim for a 'relaxed-first' pattern, starting with slightly lower fractions and gradually increasing. This allows Virginia to manage its current infections while slowly integrating inbound travelers as its own epidemic situation potentially stabilizes or improves. The quantitative logic for imported infections is roughly: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I_arizona / S_arizona). Trade-offs involve balancing economic activity and personal liberty against the risk of importing new cases, especially from a state with a notable 'I' population.

Lower fractions are applied in earlier weeks to reduce initial imported burden, gradually increasing them as Virginia's internal situation may improve or as more information becomes available. The expected imported infections are estimated as: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I_mississippi / S_mississippi). The trade-off is between stringent initial control to protect public health and the economic impact of reduced mobility.

Despite its large population, the per capita 'I' count is low, suggesting a lower immediate risk of importing active infections. However, the sheer volume of inbound flow from Texas (highest among all origin states) means even a low per-capita risk can translate to a significant number of imported cases. We opt for a more 'even' distribution with slight fluctuations, recognizing the high baseline flow. The logic for imported infections is: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I_texas / S_texas). The trade-off here is primarily managing the volume of traffic; while individual risk from Texas travelers is lower, the aggregate risk is considerable due to high flow. Maintaining relatively consistent fractions aims to provide stability for this major corridor. The sum of fractions is 0.1600 + 0.1650 + 0.1700 + 0.1700 + 0.1650 + 0.1730 = 1.0000."

For states with moderate risk profiles (Arizona, New Mexico), a 'relaxed-first' or gradually increasing fraction pattern is adopted, providing a controlled increase in mobility over time.

Its average (I+E)/Population ratio (approx. 0.00078) is lower than Virginia's current ratio (approx. 0.00114), indicating a lower per-traveler infection risk. However, the absolute number of potentially imported infected/exposed individuals is moderate (around 3.47 per day) due to its average daily inflow. Expected imported infections are proportional to `Flow * ft * (I+E)/Population`. Given Arizona's (I+E)/Pop is lower than Virginia's, the immediate threat of significantly escalating Virginia's internal prevalence from individual travelers is reduced compared to states with higher prevalence. An 'even' distribution ([0.166, 0.167, 0.167, 0.167, 0.167, 0.166]) is recommended. This pattern maintains a consistent level of control and mobility throughout the 6-week period, which is beneficial for stable planning, given Arizona's moderate and relatively lower prevalence compared to Virginia. This balances the need for epidemic control by not allowing excessive early flow with the desire for stable mobility for economic and social activities.

This translates to a very high expected number of imported infected/exposed individuals (around 18.31 per day), making it the primary source of potential imported cases. The high prevalence in Mississippi means that `Flow * ft * (I+E)/Population` will result in a substantial number of imported infections if flow is not tightly controlled. Minimizing this product, especially in early weeks, is crucial to prevent an immediate surge in Virginia's case load. A 'strict-first' pattern ([0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.25]) is implemented. This approach heavily restricts traffic in the initial weeks (f1, f2) to reduce the immediate risk of importing a large number of cases, thereby giving Virginia's epidemic response more time to manage its internal situation. Flow is gradually relaxed in later weeks, assuming some stabilization or potential for adaptation. This policy prioritizes epidemic control by sacrificing early mobility from a high-risk state, trading a significant reduction in potential imported infections for reduced economic and social interaction in the short term.

Its average (I+E)/Population ratio (approx. 0.00025) is significantly lower than Virginia's, and it also has the lowest average daily inbound flow. Consequently, the expected number of imported infected/exposed individuals is very low (around 0.43 per day). With a very low `(I+E)/Population` and low `Flow`, the product `Flow * ft * (I+E)/Population` is minimal. This state contributes the least to imported infections, making it a prime candidate for prioritizing mobility. A 'relaxed-first' pattern ([0.25, 0.20, 0.15, 0.15, 0.125, 0.125]) is adopted. This front-loads a higher proportion of the total allowed flow into the earlier weeks, maximizing immediate economic and social benefits, given the very low associated health risk. The flow decreases slightly in later weeks, maintaining a generally relaxed stance. This policy heavily prioritizes mobility and economic activity with minimal impact on epidemic control.

This combination results in a moderate expected number of imported infected/exposed individuals (around 2.99 per day), comparable to Arizona, despite its very low prevalence. While `(I+E)/Population` is very low, the large `Flow` means that the term `Flow * ft * (I+E)/Population` still needs careful management to avoid accumulating a significant number of imported cases. A 'slightly relaxed-first' pattern ([0.20, 0.18, 0.16, 0.16, 0.15, 0.15]) is chosen. This allows for a slightly higher proportion of traffic in the initial weeks to leverage the economic benefits of high mobility from a low-prevalence state, while gradually tapering off to manage the cumulative effect of the high flow. This strategy balances the desire for economic and social mobility from a large, low-prevalence state with the need to manage the absolute number of imported cases due to high traffic volume.

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocations are designed to collectively minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia by strategically managing the risk of imported infections from diverse origin states. The core principle is to heavily restrict flow from states with high infection prevalence (e.g., Mississippi) in the initial weeks, thereby reducing the immediate epidemiological burden on Virginia. Conversely, states with very low prevalence (e.g., New Mexico) are allowed higher early mobility to capture economic benefits with minimal health risk. States with moderate risk profiles (e.g., Arizona, Texas) are managed with an even or slightly relaxed-first approach, balancing control with mobility, considering both their prevalence and absolute flow volume. This differentiated approach ensures that the most impactful risks are addressed proactively, while lower risks are managed to support economic recovery. The collective strategy aims to smooth the total incoming infection pressure over the 6-week period. By front-loading restrictions on high-risk states and relaxing them on low-risk states, Virginia can maintain a more stable overall imported infection rate. For instance, the very low initial flow from Mississippi (5% in week 1) significantly reduces the highest source of imported infections, while the higher initial flow from New Mexico (25% in week 1) or Texas (20% in week 1) provides economic relief without introducing a disproportionate number of new cases. This risk balancing across states and weeks ensures that the total 'imported_infected ~ Sum(Flow_i * ft_i * (I_i/Pop_i))' is minimized in the early, critical weeks, and then gradually adjusted. These recommendations are sensitive to changes in prevalence in origin states and Virginia. If an origin state's prevalence significantly increases, its 'ft' values, especially for early weeks, might need to be lowered further (more strict-first). Conversely, if Virginia's internal prevalence substantially rises, the relative risk from states with lower prevalence diminishes, potentially allowing for more relaxed inbound policies across the board. The effectiveness of these policies also depends on the accuracy of the SEIQRD parameters and the assumption that the 42-day average inflow remains constant in total."

Conversely, states with lower immediate risk (e.g., New Mexico) or states with large populations but lower prevalence (e.g., Arizona, Texas) are managed with more evenly distributed or gradually increasing flows. This quantitative cooperation logic ensures that Virginia's limited resources for contact tracing and healthcare are not overwhelmed by sudden surges from high-risk origins.

Sensitivity reasoning suggests that if the prevalence (I/population) in a given origin state were to increase significantly, our current relaxed-first or even patterns would need to shift towards a stricter, front-loaded control (lower fractions in early weeks) for that specific state. Conversely, if 'beta' (infection rate) in Virginia were to increase, necessitating stricter overall control, all fractions would ideally be shifted to later weeks or distributed more evenly with an overall lower daily flow, if possible, to reduce total imported cases.

    "notes": "Arizona's past 21-day average shows a relatively low I count (7980) compared to its large S population (8.6M), suggesting a moderate infection risk. The Q count (175494) indicates a significant past burden but also potentially a higher level of testing/reporting. The R count (234693) is also moderate. To minimize imported infections, we propose a 'relaxed-first' pattern with a slight increase in flow over time. The rationale is to allow initial travel, but with a cautious ramp-up, monitoring Virginia's internal SEIQRD status. Imported infected individuals are estimated by Flow * ft * (I/S_population). Given Arizona's moderate I/S ratio, a gradual increase in flow is deemed acceptable, balancing mobility needs with a controlled rise in potential exposure.

    "notes": "Mississippi exhibits a high I count (45109) relative to its S population (426232), indicating a significant active infection rate. The E count (108199) is also high, suggesting a substantial number of future cases. This poses a high risk of imported infections. Therefore, a 'strict-first' approach is adopted, with higher flow in earlier weeks and a slight reduction or stabilization in later weeks. This strategy aims to manage immediate influx while allowing for potential improvements in Mississippi's epidemiological situation or Virginia's preparedness. Imported infected individuals are estimated by Flow * ft * (I/S_population). Given Mississippi's elevated I/S ratio, careful management of inbound flow is critical.

    "notes": "New Mexico presents a low I count (3214) and E count (14121) relative to its large S population (8.5M). The R count (120901) is also relatively low. This indicates a comparatively low current infection risk. An 'even' distribution pattern with slight fluctuations is chosen, as the risk is manageable and does not necessitate aggressive restriction or relaxation trends. This pattern supports consistent mobility while acknowledging the need for ongoing monitoring. Imported infections are anticipated to be lower due to the favorable I/S ratio. The trade-off here is to maintain steady economic and social connections without significantly increasing the epidemic burden on Virginia.

    "notes": "Texas has a high I count (44872) and E count (26366) within a very large S population (20.3M). While the I/S ratio is not as high as Mississippi's, the absolute number of infected individuals is substantial, representing a significant potential for imported infections. A 'relaxed-first' approach with a slight ramp-up is proposed, similar to Arizona but with more caution due to higher absolute numbers. This allows for initial essential travel but provides flexibility to adjust if Virginia's internal situation deteriorates or Texas's infection rates surge. The strategy balances the need for mobility from a large neighboring state with the imperative to control disease spread. The fractions [0.15, 0.15, 0.16, 0.18, 0.18, 0.18] sum to 1.00."

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy prioritizes minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia by balancing infection risk from origin states with mobility needs. States with a higher ratio of Infected (I) to Susceptible (S) population (e.g., Mississippi) are subject to more stringent control in earlier weeks (higher initial fractions to front-load essential travel, with a subsequent reduction to mitigate sustained risk). States with lower I/S ratios (e.g., New Mexico) receive a more even distribution of flow, reflecting a lower perceived risk. For states with large populations and moderate I counts (e.g., Texas, Arizona), a 'relaxed-first' or gradually increasing flow pattern is adopted, allowing for essential movement while monitoring trends. This quantitative cooperation logic aims to smooth the importation of potential infections over the 6-week period, preventing sudden surges. The weekly proportions are calibrated to distribute the total ground truth flow over 6 weeks while attempting to front-load or back-load based on current risk assessments. For instance, Mississippi's relatively high I/S ratio leads to a slightly higher initial allocation, but with a plateau or slight reduction, to manage immediate risk. Conversely, Arizona and Texas, despite their large total flows, have a slightly increasing trend, reflecting a more cautious approach to ramp up. This strategy aims to reduce the peak burden on Virginia's healthcare system. Sensitivity reasoning suggests that if beta (infection rate) in Virginia or origin states were to increase, or if prevalence (I/S) were higher than estimated, the proposed 'relaxed-first' or increasing patterns would need to be re-evaluated towards stricter, 'strict-first' approaches to prevent overwhelming local resources. Conversely, if origin states show rapid improvements in their SEIQRD metrics, more relaxed policies could be considered without compromising Virginia's epidemic control."
