The approach balances immediate and future risks, prioritizing caution from states with higher infection prevalence (Virginia, New Mexico) or high traffic volume (Texas). For states like Mississippi, a more gradual approach is taken. Cross-state reasoning involves a weighted consideration: (I/population) * Flow. States with higher (I/population) are subject to more stringent or carefully balanced flow distributions. For instance, New Mexico and Virginia, despite lower absolute flows than Texas, receive similar scrutiny due to their higher I/population ratios. Texas, with its massive flow, requires careful management of its large inbound volume. Quantitative cooperation logic ensures that the total inflow over 6 weeks remains constant for each state, distributing the risk across weeks. By adjusting weekly proportions (ft), we can either front-load or back-load the risk, or maintain an even spread. The current strategy leans towards a mixed approach: slight strict-first for Texas due to sheer volume, slightly relaxed-first for Mississippi and Virginia to allow for initial observation or necessary travel, and even for New Mexico due to its persistent risk profile. This distribution attempts to smooth out potential infection peaks. Sensitivity reasoning suggests that if prevalence (I/population) in an origin state were to increase significantly, the corresponding fractions for early weeks would need to be reduced (stricter control). Conversely, if prevalence decreases or Arizona's internal immunity improves, fractions could be adjusted upwards (relaxed control). If the 'beta' for Arizona were higher, indicating faster internal spread, a more uniformly strict approach across all origin states would be necessary to reduce any additional external pressure."

Cross-state reasoning: The overarching goal of these inbound traffic allocations is to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Mississippi. By analyzing the (I+E)/Pop ratios and inbound flow volumes for each origin state, we established a risk profile. States like New Mexico and Virginia, despite having lower absolute inbound flows than Texas, present a higher per-traveler infection risk due to their higher prevalence. Texas, conversely, has the highest flow but a very low per-traveler risk, while Arizona falls in between. The consistent 'even' distribution pattern chosen for all states aims to uniformly spread the potential for imported cases over the six-week period. This strategy prevents any single week from experiencing an unmanageable surge from any particular origin, thereby helping to stabilize Mississippi's internal epidemic management and reduce the likelihood of overwhelming its healthcare system. \n2. Quantitative cooperation logic: The core principle is to manage the expected number of imported infections, which is approximated as `daily_flow * ft * (I_origin / Population_origin)`. By setting `ft` to approximately 1/6 for all weeks and states, we ensure that the total potential imported infection load from each state is distributed as evenly as possible over the 6-week horizon. This approach avoids concentrating risk in specific weeks, which could lead to an increased local transmission rate (beta) in Mississippi due to heightened exposure. This strategy implicitly assumes that Mississippi's capacity to handle new cases remains constant, and that the prevalence in origin states remains stable. This approach prioritizes a predictable and manageable influx of potential cases, allowing Mississippi's existing SEIQRDP dynamics to adapt without sudden shocks. \n3. Sensitivity reasoning: The efficacy of these recommendations is highly sensitive to changes in the underlying epidemiological parameters, particularly the prevalence (`I/Population`) in origin states and Mississippi's own transmissibility (`beta`). If an origin state's `I/Population` were to significantly increase, the current even distribution might prove insufficient, leading to a higher than expected number of imported cases. In such a scenario, a 'strict-first' approach (shifting flow to later weeks with assumed improvement) or progressively stricter weekly controls would be warranted for that specific state, if allowed by the constant total flow constraint. Conversely, if an origin state's prevalence were to significantly decrease, a 'relaxed-first' approach could be considered to boost mobility. Similarly, if Mississippi's `beta` were to rise, indicating increased internal transmission, while direct modification of total flow is not allowed here, it would necessitate more stringent internal non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to cope with the existing and imported case load. These recommendations are based on current average conditions and would require immediate re-evaluation if these epidemiological parameters change significantly."

States with higher current and near-future infection pressure, quantified by the (I+E)/Pop index, receive stricter early-week flow restrictions. For instance, New Mexico and Mississippi, identified as highest risk, face the most aggressive 'strict-first' policies, while Arizona, with lower current risk but notable exposed cases, receives a slightly more relaxed but still cautious 'strict-first' approach. Virginia, despite moderate per-capita risk, has the highest absolute infected count, warranting a moderately strict early stance. This differentiated approach concentrates control efforts where they are most impactful in preventing immediate infection surges.\nThis policy employs a 'strict-first' temporal distribution for all origin states, but with varying degrees of stringency. By allocating lower fractions (ft) in earlier weeks for higher-risk states, we effectively 'flatten the curve' of potential imported infections into Texas. This defers a larger portion of the total allowed flow to later weeks, providing Texas's healthcare system more time to adapt, or for the epidemic situations in origin states to potentially improve. This risk balancing across weeks and states is crucial for optimizing public health outcomes within the constraint of fixed total inbound flow for each origin.\nThe effectiveness of this policy is sensitive to changes in origin state prevalence and Texas's internal transmission dynamics. If an origin state's (I+E)/Pop index significantly increases (e.g., due to an outbreak), its weekly fractions would need to be adjusted to be even stricter in early weeks. Conversely, a sustained decline in prevalence might allow for earlier relaxation. Similarly, if Texas's own beta (transmission rate) were to increase, indicating faster internal spread, a more restrictive overall inbound policy (lower average ft across all weeks and states) would be necessary. If beta decreases, allowing more internal control, some relaxation might be possible. The current policy assumes a relatively stable epidemic trajectory for the next 6 weeks, with an emphasis on mitigating immediate high-prevalence threats."

States with higher per-capita infected populations (e.g., Mississippi, New Mexico) are initially allocated lower fractions to limit early imported infections, allowing Virginia's healthcare system to manage its existing burden (S=8.5M, E=1825, I=3189, Q=4825). For states with moderate risk profiles (Arizona, New Mexico), a 'relaxed-first' or gradually increasing fraction pattern is adopted, providing a controlled increase in mobility over time. Texas, despite a lower per-capita infection rate, demands careful consideration due to its significantly higher baseline inbound flow; thus, its fractions are distributed more evenly to manage the total volume of potential imported cases. \n\nQuantitative cooperation logic involves balancing the total expected imported infections across all states and weeks. For instance, by front-loading stricter controls on higher-risk states (Mississippi) and allowing slightly more relaxed flows from lower-risk states (Texas, given its high baseline), we attempt to smooth the total infection pressure on Virginia. This weekly adjustment allows for a 'pulsing' effect, where initial weeks are generally more restrictive for higher-risk states, and later weeks become more relaxed, assuming Virginia's internal epidemic situation does not worsen. The total imported 'I' cases for a given week t are approximately sum(Flow_i * ft_i * (I_i / S_i)) across all origin states i. Our goal is to keep this sum manageable.\n\nSensitivity reasoning suggests that if prevalence (I/S) in origin states were to significantly increase, our 'relaxed-first' patterns would need immediate reassessment towards 'strict-first' or more uniform low fractions. Conversely, if Virginia's beta (0.19) were to drop significantly, indicating lower internal transmission, we could afford to be more liberal with inbound flows. If the actual inbound flow baselines differ, the absolute number of imported cases would change proportionally, but the relative risk and the chosen fractional patterns would largely hold unless the relative risk profiles of states change."

States posing a higher risk (Texas and Mississippi, due to high total imported infection potential or high I_prop) are subject to a 'strict-first' policy, which front-loads mobility restrictions to curb immediate imported infections. This strategy is critical for preventing an early surge that could overwhelm Arizona's healthcare capacity. Conversely, states with lower overall risk (New Mexico and Virginia) are assigned an 'even' distribution to maintain predictable mobility and minimize socio-economic disruption, while still acknowledging and managing the constant, albeit lower, risk of infection import. This differential approach allows Arizona to target its control efforts where they are most impactful.\n\nThe core quantitative logic involves minimizing the product of `Flow * ft * (I/Population)` for each week, summed over all weeks and all states, given the constraint that `sum(ft)` for each state must be 1. By applying 'strict-first' to high-risk sources like Texas (highest total potential imported infections: 160.85) and Mississippi (2nd highest: 129.29), we reduce the `ft` values in early weeks. This defers a portion of the total fixed imported infections to later weeks, spreading the burden over time and allowing Arizona's internal epidemic response to strengthen or origin state prevalence to decline. For New Mexico and Virginia, where the combined effect of I/Pop and Flow is lower (57.06 and 29.02 respectively), an 'even' distribution maintains a stable risk profile without imposing undue early restrictions.\n\nThe effectiveness of these policies is sensitive to several factors. Firstly, the assumption that average past 21-day SEIQRD values accurately reflect future prevalence in origin states is critical. Rapid changes in prevalence could render the current allocations suboptimal. Secondly, Arizona's internal epidemic dynamics and healthcare capacity are not explicitly considered in the weekly allocation strategy. A worsening internal situation in Arizona would necessitate more stringent inbound controls across the board. Lastly, the policies are sensitive to the actual compliance with mobility restrictions; deviations from allocated flow would alter intended mitigation effects. Future adjustments should incorporate real-time prevalence trends and Arizona's evolving epidemiological situation."

The 'relaxed-first' pattern, with slightly higher allocations in later weeks, is consistently applied across all origin states. This approach is based on the assumption that Mississippi's internal epidemic control capacity will improve or stabilize over the 6-week period, allowing for a gradual increase in inbound mobility without overwhelming its healthcare system. The strategy attempts to balance the immediate need for mobility and economic activity with the long-term goal of disease containment. \n\nQuantitative cooperation logic involves balancing the risk profile of each state with its baseline inbound flow. States with higher relative 'I' populations (like Virginia) receive slightly more conservative initial allocations, while states with lower 'I' (like New Mexico) might see slightly higher proportions earlier or more evenly distributed. By distributing the total flow over 6 weeks with a tilt towards later weeks, we reduce the immediate influx of potential imported infections, allowing for better monitoring and adaptive responses. This approach implicitly assumes that 'ft' acts as a multiplier on the imported infection rate, so by keeping initial 'ft' values lower, we reduce early imported cases. \n\nSensitivity reasoning suggests that if prevalence (I/Population) in origin states were to increase significantly, the 'relaxed-first' approach would need re-evaluation, possibly shifting to a 'strict-first' or 'even' distribution to mitigate higher initial risk. Similarly, if Mississippi's internal 'beta' (infection rate) or 'mu' (mortality rate) were to increase, indicating a more fragile local situation, then stricter 'ft' values across all weeks for all states would be advisable to reduce the burden of imported cases. Conversely, if prevalence drops or Mississippi's response capacity improves, a more even or front-loaded distribution could be considered."

The core strategy involves a differentiated approach based on each origin state's absolute potential for importing infections, calculated as the product of its baseline inbound flow and its current infected prevalence (I/Population). This quantitative logic ensures that states posing the highest risk, whether due to high prevalence or high volume, receive the most stringent early controls. \n\n**Cross-state reasoning and quantitative cooperation logic:** Texas, despite its relatively low prevalence, presents the highest absolute risk due to its massive inbound flow (12.69 potential imported infections daily), necessitating the most stringent early controls (8percent of total flow in week 1). Mississippi, with its significantly high prevalence, also requires a strict-first approach (3.18 potential imported infections daily), albeit slightly less restrictive in early weeks than Texas, reflecting its lower total flow but higher per-capita risk. Arizona, with moderate flow and prevalence similar to New Mexico's (1.12 potential imported infections daily), receives a moderately strict-first approach, balancing caution with consistent mobility. Virginia, having the lowest flow and moderate prevalence (0.21 potential imported infections daily), is deemed the lowest risk contributor and thus receives a more evenly distributed, slightly increasing flow. This coordinated staggering of inbound traffic across states, with higher-risk states experiencing greater early restrictions, aims to prevent an initial overwhelming surge of cases in New Mexico, distributing potential imported infections over time and reducing the peak burden on the state's healthcare system. By front-loading restrictions for the riskiest flows, we protect New Mexico's current favorable epidemic status. \n\n**Sensitivity reasoning:** The effectiveness of these policies is highly sensitive to changes in several factors. If the prevalence (I/Population) in origin states significantly decreases over the six-week period, a more relaxed-first or evenly distributed policy could be considered for future periods, as the risk of imported infections would diminish. Conversely, an increase in prevalence in any origin state would necessitate an immediate tightening of controls, potentially shifting towards even stricter 'strict-first' patterns or even reducing total allocated flow if possible, to maintain the control over `Flow * ft * (I/population)`. New Mexico's internal transmission rate (beta) is also critical; a higher beta (currently 0.1118) would mean even a small number of imported cases could trigger a rapid local outbreak, demanding even more aggressive inbound controls. The current policies assume a relatively stable situation in origin states for the immediate future and New Mexico's current beta allows for some managed influx, but any deviation requires swift re-evaluation to maintain the primary objective of minimizing cumulative cases and deaths."

States with higher E and I populations (e.g., Mississippi) receive stricter initial controls (lower fractions in early weeks) to reduce the immediate risk of imported infections. This 'strict-first' approach allows Texas to better manage its internal epidemic situation before absorbing higher external exposure. States with lower infection pressure (e.g., New Mexico) are given slightly more relaxed initial allocations, balancing epidemic control with economic and social needs. Arizona and Virginia, with moderate risks, receive more balanced or slightly relaxed-first distributions, allowing for a phased increase in mobility. The quantitative cooperation logic involves balancing the total flow constraint over 6 weeks with the weekly distribution to prevent overwhelming the healthcare system. By front-loading restrictions on high-risk states and distributing the remaining flow over time, we aim to flatten the curve of imported cases. This approach considers that imported infections directly contribute to Texas's E and I populations, increasing beta and ultimately confirmed and deceased cases. Sensitivity reasoning suggests that if an origin state's prevalence (I/population) or transmissibility (beta) were to significantly increase unexpectedly, our current relaxed-later or even distribution strategies might need to be re-evaluated for a stricter, more immediate response. Conversely, if prevalence drops, more relaxed policies could be considered sooner. The overall goal is a dynamic, risk-mitigated approach to mobility."

The core principle is to heavily restrict flow from states with high infection prevalence (e.g., Mississippi) in the initial weeks, thereby reducing the immediate epidemiological burden on Virginia. Conversely, states with very low prevalence (e.g., New Mexico) are allowed higher early mobility to capture economic benefits with minimal health risk. States with moderate risk profiles (e.g., Arizona, Texas) are managed with an even or slightly relaxed-first approach, balancing control with mobility, considering both their prevalence and absolute flow volume. This differentiated approach ensures that the most impactful risks are addressed proactively, while lower risks are managed to support economic recovery. The collective strategy aims to smooth the total incoming infection pressure over the 6-week period. By front-loading restrictions on high-risk states and relaxing them on low-risk states, Virginia can maintain a more stable overall imported infection rate. For instance, the very low initial flow from Mississippi (5percent in week 1) significantly reduces the highest source of imported infections, while the higher initial flow from New Mexico (25percent in week 1) or Texas (20percent in week 1) provides economic relief without introducing a disproportionate number of new cases. This risk balancing across states and weeks ensures that the total 'imported_infected ~ Sum(Flow_i * ft_i * (I_i/Pop_i))' is minimized in the early, critical weeks, and then gradually adjusted. These recommendations are sensitive to changes in prevalence in origin states and Virginia. If an origin state's prevalence significantly increases, its 'ft' values, especially for early weeks, might need to be lowered further (more strict-first). Conversely, if Virginia's internal prevalence substantially rises, the relative risk from states with lower prevalence diminishes, potentially allowing for more relaxed inbound policies across the board. The effectiveness of these policies also depends on the accuracy of the SEIQRD parameters and the assumption that the 42-day average inflow remains constant in total."

High-risk states like Mississippi (high prevalence) and Texas (high flow, moderate prevalence) are subjected to 'strict-first' policies, front-loading mobility restrictions to curb the immediate importation of Exposed and Infected individuals. This reduces the initial infection pressure on Arizona, which is currently managing its own significant number of active cases (I=1062, Q=22033). Conversely, New Mexico, identified as a low-risk origin due to its very low prevalence, is given an 'even' allocation, prioritizing sustained mobility where public health risk is minimal. Virginia, presenting a moderate risk, receives a moderately 'strict-first' approach. This quantitative cooperation logic balances public health imperatives with mobility needs by allocating stricter controls when and where the risk of imported infections (proportional to Flow * ft * (E+I)/Population) is highest, particularly in the critical early weeks. The fixed total inbound flow over 6 weeks for each state ensures a baseline level of economic activity is maintained. Sensitivity analysis suggests that this policy would adapt if prevalence rates in origin states change; for instance, a significant increase in E+I in New Mexico would necessitate a shift towards a 'strict-first' approach for that state. Similarly, if Arizona's internal transmission rate (beta) were to increase, a more stringent 'strict-first' policy across all states would be advisable to prevent exponential growth."

States with higher 'I' (Infected) populations relative to their overall population (e.g., Texas, Virginia, Arizona) are subjected to stricter controls in earlier weeks ('strict-first' pattern), minimizing the immediate influx of active cases. Conversely, states with lower 'I' populations (e.g., New Mexico) are allowed slightly more flexibility in later weeks, balancing risk with mobility needs. This approach ensures that Mississippi's internal epidemic management is not unduly burdened by external infection pressure, especially during the initial critical weeks. The overall goal is to smooth out the imported infection curve, preventing sharp spikes that could overwhelm local healthcare resources. \n2. **Quantitative cooperation logic:** Risk balancing across weeks and states is achieved by allocating lower fractions (ft) in early weeks for higher-risk states, effectively reducing `Flow * ft * (I/Population)` when Mississippi's own 'I' count is still substantial. As the 6-week period progresses, a slight relaxation in some states' allocations is introduced, assuming that Mississippi's internal epidemic situation might stabilize or improve, allowing for increased mobility. The fractions are meticulously chosen to ensure that the sum for each state's 6-week period equals 1, maintaining the ground truth total flow while optimizing its temporal distribution to minimize infection import. The specific 'I/Population' ratio for each origin state is a primary driver in determining the weekly distribution of flow, with higher ratios leading to more front-loaded restrictions. \n3. **Sensitivity reasoning:** If the prevalence (I/Population) in an origin state were to significantly increase, the current 'strict-first' or moderately strict patterns would need to be re-evaluated for further tightening, especially in early weeks, to maintain the desired level of epidemic control. Conversely, a substantial decrease in prevalence might allow for earlier relaxation of controls. If Mississippi's beta (transmission rate) were to increase, indicating a more aggressive internal spread, then all inbound flows would need to be re-evaluated for stricter control across all weeks and states to prevent additional external pressure. Changes in alpha (incubation rate) or gamma (recovery rate) could alter the internal dynamics, indirectly influencing the optimal inbound flow by changing Mississippi's capacity to absorb imported cases."

States with higher current or incubating infection rates (e.g., Mississippi, Arizona) receive stricter initial control measures, meaning lower 'ft' values in the early weeks. This 'strict-first' approach is designed to reduce the immediate influx of infected individuals when New Mexico's own 'I' count is relatively low (469), thereby protecting its susceptible population and preventing a rapid escalation of internal spread. For states with very high total flow (e.g., Texas), even a low per-capita infection rate can translate to a high number of imported cases, warranting a careful, slightly front-loaded control. States with lower overall flow (e.g., Virginia) allow for a more balanced approach, as their absolute contribution to imported cases is smaller. \n2. **Quantitative cooperation logic**: The strategy employs a risk-balancing act across weeks and states. The initial weeks (Week 1-2) generally see lower fractions for all states, reflecting a collective effort to reduce the overall imported viral load into New Mexico. This 'front-loading' of control is critical because New Mexico's 'S' population is very high (5.2M), making it vulnerable to new introductions. As the weeks progress, the fractions generally increase, assuming that the initial strictness allows New Mexico to better manage its internal epidemic and that the external situation does not drastically worsen. This gradual relaxation balances the need for long-term mobility with sustained epidemic control. The sum of (Flow * ft * I/Pop) across all states for each week is implicitly minimized by this strategy, focusing on reducing the initial peak of imported infections. \n3. **Sensitivity reasoning**: If the prevalence (I/Pop) in origin states were to significantly increase, particularly in high-flow states like Texas and Arizona, the current 'strict-first' approach would need to be intensified, with even lower 'ft' values in early weeks. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, especially in high-risk states like Mississippi, the policy could be relaxed sooner. If the 'beta' (infection rate) in New Mexico were higher, meaning the virus spreads more easily internally, then the need for stricter inbound control across all states would be paramount, as imported cases would quickly lead to larger local outbreaks. A lower 'beta' would offer more flexibility. This plan assumes current prevalence and beta values are stable; any significant change would necessitate re-evaluation and adjustment of the weekly fractions to maintain optimal control."

States with higher current (E+I)/S ratios (e.g., Mississippi) receive a 'strict-first' allocation, meaning higher flow earlier to potentially capture a period of lower internal Texas prevalence, or to reduce flow when Texas's internal prevalence might be higher later, thereby limiting the maximum potential for imported cases. States with moderate risk (Arizona, Virginia) adopt a 'relaxed-first' approach, gradually increasing flow to allow Texas to adapt to its internal dynamics while accommodating increasing mobility. New Mexico, with its very low risk, maintains an 'even' distribution, prioritizing consistent mobility. This risk balancing across weeks and states aims to smooth the influx of potential infections, preventing large spikes while maintaining a baseline level of mobility. For instance, if Texas's internal E/I population is projected to peak in later weeks, reducing inbound flow from high-risk states during those weeks would be beneficial. Conversely, if Texas is in a trough, higher flow might be permissible. The current strategy assumes a relatively stable internal epidemic in Texas, allowing for a gradual increase in overall mobility from moderate-risk states. Sensitivity to prevalence or beta variations is crucial: if a state's prevalence (E+I) significantly increases, its 'fractions' should be re-evaluated to become stricter, particularly in earlier weeks. Conversely, if Texas's beta (infection rate) were higher, a stricter policy across all states would be warranted to prevent rapid escalation of imported cases, potentially shifting towards more 'strict-first' patterns even for moderate-risk states. The current plan is a dynamic compromise, prioritizing stability and gradual adjustment."

States with higher current infection prevalence (e.g., Mississippi, Texas) are subject to a 'strict-first' approach, meaning a larger proportion of their total 6-week flow is deferred to later weeks, thereby reducing immediate import pressure on Virginia's healthcare system. Conversely, states with lower prevalence (e.g., New Mexico) maintain a more 'even' or slightly increasing flow distribution, acknowledging their lower risk profile. Arizona, with moderate risk, follows a cautiously increasing trend. This 'quantitative cooperation logic' aims to front-load control for high-risk origins, allowing time for Virginia's internal SEIQRD dynamics to stabilize (considering its current E=17606, I=4180, Q=25302), and for the epidemic situation in origin states to potentially improve before mobility is fully restored. The risk balancing across weeks and states ensures that the total inbound flow remains constant for each origin over the 6 weeks, satisfying the constraint while strategically distributing the flow over time. Sensitivity reasoning suggests that if prevalence (I/Population) in an origin state were to suddenly increase, the 'strict-first' states would require even lower initial fractions, and 'even' states might need to shift towards 'strict-first'. Conversely, if Virginia's internal beta (infection rate) were higher, a universally stricter approach across all origin states and weeks would be warranted to protect the local population."

High-risk states like Mississippi, characterized by a very high (E+I)/Population prevalence, face significant early-week restrictions ('strict-first' pattern) to drastically reduce the initial influx of potentially infectious individuals. States with low prevalence but high absolute inflow, such as Texas, also implement a 'strict-first' approach, albeit less aggressively, to control the total number of imported cases despite lower individual traveler risk. Virginia, with moderate risk, follows a similar cautious early-week strategy. Conversely, New Mexico, posing minimal infection risk due to its very low prevalence, maintains an 'even' flow distribution to minimize disruption. This cross-state reasoning ensures that resources are focused on the highest-impact sources of potential infection. The quantitative cooperation logic is rooted in balancing the 'infection budget' over the 6-week period. By adjusting the weekly proportions (ft) for each state, we aim to flatten the curve of imported infections, preventing large spikes that could overwhelm Arizona's healthcare system. The formula for expected imported infections, approximately `Total_Flow * ft * (E+I)/Population_origin`, guides the distribution. For example, a state with high (E+I)/Population and/or high Total_Flow requires lower ft in early weeks. This allows Arizona to absorb imported cases more gradually, providing time for internal response and adaptation. Sensitivity reasoning suggests that if Arizona's internal infection rate (beta) were higher, or if origin states' prevalence rates (E+I)/Population were to increase significantly, stricter controls across all states, especially in early weeks, would be imperative. Conversely, if origin states implemented highly effective quarantine measures (increasing Q at the expense of I), or if Arizona's own population immunity were higher, the policies could be relaxed. The current policy assumes stable prevalence rates in origin states and aims to protect Arizona's susceptible population from external shocks."

States with higher 'I' and 'Q' counts (e.g., Texas) and larger baseline flows are subject to stricter early controls (lower fractions in initial weeks) to minimize the immediate influx of infected individuals into Mississippi. States with lower risk profiles (e.g., New Mexico) or lower baseline flows allow for more flexibility or even slightly increased initial flow if deemed beneficial for other factors. This differential approach targets the most impactful sources of imported risk first, aiming to 'flatten the curve' of imported cases. The goal is to prevent a surge of imported cases from overwhelming Mississippi's healthcare system, especially in the early weeks when the state's internal epidemic response is crucial. \n2. **Quantitative cooperation logic:** The strategy balances risk over time and across states. For high-risk, high-flow states like Texas, a 'relaxed-first' (gradually increasing flow) approach is implemented. This means lower fractions (stricter control) in early weeks when Mississippi's internal S, E, I populations are potentially high and vulnerable. As Mississippi's internal epidemic might stabilize or decline (due to gamma, mu, delta, and local interventions), inbound flow can gradually increase. For states with lower absolute risk or inflow, the distribution is more even or slightly adjusted based on their specific I/population ratios. This aims to distribute the total allowed flow in a way that minimizes the peak imported infection pressure on Mississippi. The sum of (Flow * ft * I/Population) across all states and weeks is implicitly minimized by shifting higher flows to later weeks or to lower-prevalence states. \n3. **Sensitivity reasoning:** If the prevalence (I/Population) in an origin state were to significantly increase, the current 'relaxed-first' strategies for Texas and Arizona would need re-evaluation, potentially requiring even stricter early controls. Conversely, if prevalence drops sharply, earlier relaxation might be possible. If Mississippi's `beta` (infection rate) or `alpha` (incubation rate) were higher, indicating a faster internal spread, then stricter control across all origin states, especially in early weeks, would be paramount to avoid compounding the internal crisis with imported cases. If `gamma` (recovery rate) or `mu` (mortality rate) were higher, indicating a faster resolution or higher fatality, the urgency of preventing imported cases might shift, focusing more on preventing new introductions rather than managing existing ones."

The core principle is to balance the fixed total inbound flow from each origin state with the objective of reducing the immediate burden of imported infections on Texas.\n\n**Cross-state reasoning:** We observe a wide range of infection risks among the origin states, primarily driven by their respective (E+I) prevalence rates. Mississippi poses the highest risk (0.049520), followed by Virginia (0.004523) and Arizona (0.003504), while New Mexico presents the lowest risk (0.000709), even lower than Texas's own prevalence (0.001217). Our strategy is to differentiate control stringency based on this risk profile. States with higher infection prevalence face stricter controls in early weeks, deferring a larger proportion of their allowed total flow to later weeks. Conversely, New Mexico, with its low prevalence, experiences a relatively more even distribution of its flow, as its contribution to imported cases is minimal. This collective approach aims to flatten the curve of potential imported infections across all sources, preventing a simultaneous surge.\n\n**Quantitative cooperation logic:** The estimated Reproduction Number (R0) for Texas, based on the provided SEIRD parameters (beta/gamma  1.32), suggests that the epidemic is likely to grow internally. In such a scenario, early introductions of additional infected individuals can have a disproportionately larger impact due to the compounding effect of an R0 > 1. By implementing a 'strict-first, relaxed-later' pattern for higher-risk states, we effectively shift a portion of the infection burden to later weeks. While the total number of imported infected individuals from each state remains constant over the six weeks, delaying their arrival allows for more time for Texas's population to potentially develop immunity, for public health interventions to take effect, or for healthcare capacity to adapt. This temporal redistribution of risk aims to reduce the peak demand on healthcare resources and, consequently, lower cumulative cases and deaths.\n\n**Sensitivity reasoning:** The effectiveness of this policy is sensitive to several factors. Firstly, the assumption of static (E+I) prevalence rates in origin states is a simplification. If an origin state's prevalence significantly changes (e.g., a high-risk state experiences a rapid decline, or a low-risk state sees a surge), the allocated fractions might need dynamic adjustment. Secondly, changes in Texas's internal epidemic dynamics, such as a substantial drop in R0 below 1 due to successful interventions or a rise due to new variants, would alter the optimal timing of imported cases. For instance, if Texas achieves strong control, the urgency to defer imports might lessen. Lastly, the model for imported infections (`Flow * ft * prevalence`) is a linear approximation; real-world complexities like heterogeneous mixing, super-spreading events, or localized outbreaks could introduce variability not captured here. Continuous monitoring of both origin and destination state epidemiological data is crucial for adapting this policy."

States with higher current infection prevalence (e.g., Mississippi, due to its high I/S ratio) receive stricter initial controls (higher fractions in earlier weeks, implying lower allowed flow) to immediately reduce the influx of potentially infected individuals. Conversely, states with lower immediate risk (e.g., New Mexico) or states with large populations but lower prevalence (e.g., Arizona, Texas) are managed with more evenly distributed or gradually increasing flows. This quantitative cooperation logic ensures that Virginia's limited resources for contact tracing and healthcare are not overwhelmed by sudden surges from high-risk origins. By distributing traffic over 6 weeks, we avoid front-loading risk. For instance, Mississippis initial higher fraction of total flow indicates a relatively tighter control in week 1 compared to later weeks, while Arizona and Texas see a gradual increase in flow, reflecting a more cautious approach to re-opening from larger states. Sensitivity reasoning suggests that if the prevalence (I/population) in a given origin state were to increase significantly, our current relaxed-first or even patterns would need to shift towards a stricter, front-loaded control (lower fractions in early weeks) for that specific state. Conversely, if 'beta' (infection rate) in Virginia were to increase, necessitating stricter overall control, all fractions would ideally be shifted to later weeks or distributed more evenly with an overall lower daily flow, if possible, to reduce total imported cases. The current policy assumes a stable epidemiological situation in Virginia and a gradual improvement or stabilization in origin states, allowing for a phased re-opening of mobility."

The core strategy is to front-load stricter controls (lower f_t) for states posing a higher absolute risk of imported infections, thus reducing immediate virus seeding. Mississippi, with its exceptionally high prevalence, faces the most stringent early controls. Texas, despite lower prevalence, receives moderately strict early controls due to its high inbound flow volume, significantly contributing to overall imported cases. Virginia, with moderate prevalence and flow, also implements a moderately strict-first approach. In contrast, New Mexico, presenting the lowest risk, is allocated a relaxed-first pattern, allowing for more early-week mobility where the epidemiological threat is minimal.\n\nThis quantitative cooperation logic balances risk across both states and weeks. By concentrating lower f_t values in earlier weeks for high-risk states, the policy aims to reduce the Flow * f_t * (E+I)/Population product when Arizona's susceptible population is highest and local transmission dynamics might be most sensitive. This temporal risk balancing helps mitigate immediate surges. For lower-risk states, mobility is less constrained. The constant total inbound flow over 6 weeks ensures a balance between epidemic control and maintaining essential mobility.\n\nThe policy's effectiveness is sensitive to several factors. Changes in origin states' (E+I)/Population ratios are critical; an unexpected increase in a low-risk state would necessitate immediate policy re-evaluation. Arizona's internal epidemic parameters, particularly its beta and current S population, are crucial. If Arizona's local transmission rate (beta) increases, imported infections would be amplified, potentially requiring universally stricter inbound controls. The current policy assumes stable (E+I)/Population ratios for origin states; dynamic changes would require an adaptive policy framework."

The policy adopts a nuanced approach, differentiating control levels based on the origin state\'s infection risk and the absolute volume of potential inbound traffic.\n\nCross-state reasoning: States with higher (E+I)/Population ratios (Virginia at ~0.90percent, Arizona at ~0.71percent) are subjected to stricter "strict-first" policies. This front-loads restrictions, severely limiting early inbound flow when the risk of importing new infections is highest. This allows Mississippi\'s internal epidemic to potentially subside or for healthcare resources to be better mobilized before significant external introductions occur. For states with lower prevalence (Texas at ~0.15percent, New Mexico at ~0.115percent), the policies are less stringent, but still generally adopt a "slightly strict-first" or "gradually relaxed" approach. This is particularly important for Texas, which, despite low prevalence, has a massive inbound flow, meaning even a small proportion of infected travelers could lead to a large absolute number of imported cases. By varying the strictness, the policy aims to allocate the fixed total inbound flow over 6 weeks in a way that minimizes the "infection pressure wave" hitting Mississippi.\n\nQuantitative cooperation logic: The objective is to manage the total expected imported infections (Sum over states and weeks [Flow_state * ft_week * (E_state + I_state) / Pop_state]) to keep it as low as possible, especially in early weeks. The chosen fractions for each state collectively work to defer a significant portion of total inbound mobility from higher-risk sources to later weeks. This temporal distribution of risk helps smooth out the potential impact, preventing early surges that could overwhelm Mississippi\'s already burdened system. For instance, the very low initial fractions for Virginia and Arizona directly reduce the number of high-risk individuals entering Mississippi when its own population is most vulnerable. The aggregate effect of these policies across all states is a collective reduction in early imported cases, providing a critical buffer for Mississippi.\n\nSensitivity reasoning: The effectiveness of these recommendations is sensitive to several factors. If the actual prevalence (E+I) in origin states were to increase significantly beyond the 21-day averages, the current "strict-first" policies might need to be even more aggressive, with lower initial fractions for all states. Conversely, if origin state prevalence drops sharply, some early restrictions could be relaxed. Similarly, if Mississippi\'s internal transmission rate (beta) were higher, the state would be more susceptible to imported infections, necessitating even stricter and more prolonged controls across all origin states. If Mississippi\'s own E+I numbers were to decrease substantially, it could tolerate a more relaxed-first or even distribution of traffic from lower-risk states. The policy assumes that Mississippi\'s internal epidemic dynamics will allow for some reduction in its own E+I over the 6-week period, making later weeks safer for increased inbound mobility. Any changes in these underlying epidemiological parameters would require a re-evaluation of the weekly traffic allocations.'

Policies are differentiated based on the infection risk (quantified by (I+E)/Population ratios) and absolute inbound traffic volume. States with exceptionally high prevalence (Mississippi, Virginia) are subjected to the strictest 'strict-first' controls, front-loading restrictions to minimize immediate import of infectious individuals. States with moderate prevalence but high absolute flow (Texas) also receive a strict-first approach, albeit less aggressive, to manage the sheer volume of potential cases. Arizona, with its high exposed population, is similarly managed with early restrictions. This tiered approach ensures New Mexico is maximally protected from the most virulent external threats during critical early weeks. The core principle is risk balancing. By applying lower 'ft' values in initial weeks for higher-risk states, we reduce the expected weekly imported infections when New Mexico might be most vulnerable. As weeks progress, 'ft' values are gradually increased, allowing full baseline flow but shifting mobility to later periods. This temporal shift reduces the peak burden on New Mexico's healthcare system. The effectiveness of these policies is sensitive to several factors. If actual prevalence in origin states significantly exceeds 21-day averages, risk will be underestimated, potentially requiring stricter controls. Conversely, if prevalence drops rapidly, the 'strict-first' approach might be overly cautious. Variations in New Mexico's transmission rate also affect how imported cases translate into local outbreaks. The model assumes relatively stable origin state epidemiology; any sharp increase would necessitate re-evaluation. Efficacy also relies on adherence to restrictions and New Mexico's capacity to manage imported cases."

This is achieved by implementing a differentiated approach based on the perceived infection risk of each origin state, primarily assessed by its `(I+E)/Population` ratio. States posing a higher risk (e.g., Mississippi, Virginia, Arizona) are subjected to stricter controls in the initial weeks, meaning a lower proportion of their total 6-week inbound flow is permitted. Conversely, states with lower risk (e.g., New Mexico) have their flow distributed more evenly. This staggered approach aims to flatten the curve of imported infections, preventing a large influx of potentially infectious individuals when Texas might be most vulnerable or its healthcare system is under strain.\n\nBy front-loading restrictions on high-risk states, we reduce the initial `I` and `E` contributions to Texas's population. The formula `imported_infected_weekly ~ Total_Inflow_from_state * ft * ((I+E)_state / Population_state)` highlights how `ft` is the control lever. Lower `ft` in early weeks for high-risk states directly translates to fewer imported infections when the epidemic potential is highest. As weeks progress, and assuming Texas's internal epidemic response is effective or the origin states' prevalence declines, the `ft` values for these states gradually increase, allowing the full baseline mobility to be met without overwhelming the system. This temporal redistribution of constant total flow is a key mechanism for balancing epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs.\n\nThe effectiveness of this policy is sensitive to several factors. If Texas's `beta` (transmission rate) were to increase significantly, the existing internal epidemic would accelerate, making it even more crucial to apply stricter 'strict-first' policies across all origin states, regardless of their individual risk, to prevent any additional burden. Conversely, a lower `beta` might allow for more relaxed initial controls. Furthermore, the accuracy of the `(I+E)/Population` data from origin states is critical. If actual prevalence is higher than estimated, the policy might be insufficient. If the `(I+E)/Population` ratios in origin states are projected to decrease over the 6-week period, a 'relaxed-first' or even 'wave' pattern might become more appropriate for some states. Without such projections, the 'strict-first' approach for higher-risk states serves as a conservative measure to minimize immediate adverse impacts."

States with higher per capita infection pressure (e.g., Mississippi) or high absolute infection numbers combined with large inbound flow (e.g., Texas) are subjected to stricter controls in the initial weeks ('strict-first' or 'relaxed-first' with cautious ramp-up). This front-loads epidemic control, allowing Virginia to manage its internal SEIQRD dynamics before potentially increasing external exposure. For states with lower risk (e.g., New Mexico), an 'even' distribution is applied to maintain predictable mobility without significant epidemiological concern. Arizona, with moderate risk, receives a balanced approach. This quantitative cooperation logic balances risk across weeks and states: by restricting flow from high-risk states early, we flatten the curve of imported cases, preventing a surge that could overwhelm Virginia's healthcare system. The varying weekly fractions allow for flexibility; early weeks prioritize epidemic control, while later weeks can relax restrictions if conditions improve, or tighten them if new data suggests increased risk. Sensitivity reasoning suggests that if beta (transmission rate) in Virginia or origin states were higher, or if prevalence (I/population) in origin states increased, the 'strict-first' policies would become even more critical and might need to be extended or intensified for all but the lowest-risk states. Conversely, if prevalence drops significantly, a more 'relaxed-first' or 'even' approach could be adopted more broadly to support economic recovery."

For states with high 'I' and 'E' counts (e.g., Mississippi, Texas, Virginia), a 'strict-first' or slightly restricted initial approach is adopted. This front-loads control measures in early weeks (lower f1, f2) to reduce the immediate influx of potentially infected individuals, leveraging the fact that early infections have a compounding effect. For states with lower prevalence (e.g., New Mexico), a more balanced or gradually relaxed approach is used, acknowledging a lower immediate risk. Quantitative cooperation logic is applied by understanding that imported_infected_cases = Total_Flow * ft * (I/Population_origin_state). By reducing 'ft' in early weeks for high-risk states, we effectively reduce the 'imported_infected_cases' when Arizona's own 'S' population is still high. The goal is to flatten the curve of imported infections, preventing a rapid increase in Arizona's 'I' and 'Q' counts. This risk balancing across weeks and states ensures that the total allowed flow for each state over 6 weeks remains constant, respecting baseline mobility needs, while strategically distributing the flow to mitigate peak infection risks. Sensitivity reasoning suggests that if actual prevalence (I/Population) in origin states turns out to be higher than estimated, or if the transmission rate (beta) within Arizona is higher, the current 'strict-first' policies might need to be even more stringent to maintain the same level of control. Conversely, if prevalence drops significantly, more relaxed policies could be adopted earlier. The fractions are carefully chosen to sum to 1.0000 for each state, ensuring compliance with the total flow constraint while optimizing for public health outcomes in Arizona."

Given Mississippi's current significant internal burden of Exposed (E) and Infected (I) individuals, preventing additional imported cases is paramount to avoid overwhelming local healthcare capacity and exacerbating the epidemic. \n\nQuantitative cooperation logic dictates that states with higher infection pressure, calculated as `(I+E)/Population`, and especially those with high inbound flow, receive stricter initial traffic controls. For instance, Texas, despite a moderate `(I+E)/Pop`, poses the highest absolute imported risk due to its exceptionally large inbound flow. Therefore, a 'strict-first' approach, where early weeks have lower traffic fractions, is applied to Texas, Arizona, and Virginia, which all exhibit high infection pressure. This front-loads epidemic control, reducing the immediate influx of potential carriers and allowing Mississippi more time to manage its internal situation. Conversely, New Mexico, with its very low infection pressure and flow, is assigned an 'even' distribution, maintaining consistent mobility without significant added risk. This collective strategy balances the fixed total inbound flow by adjusting its temporal distribution, striving to smooth out the curve of imported infections and avoid critical surges.\n\nSensitivity reasoning suggests that this policy is dynamic. Should origin states demonstrate a clear downward trend in their `E` and `I` populations, a more 'relaxed-first' approach could be considered for those states to boost early mobility. Conversely, if Mississippi's internal `beta` (transmission rate) were to increase, or if origin states' prevalence worsened, even stricter controls across all weeks and states might be necessary. This policy assumes current average infection rates persist for origin states; any significant change would necessitate re-evaluation."

The core principle is to implement stricter controls (lower fractions) for states that pose a higher immediate risk, considering both their disease prevalence (I+E/Population) and the volume of inbound traffic. For instance, Texas, despite its lower prevalence, receives the strictest initial control due to its massive flow, which translates to the highest absolute number of potential imported cases. Conversely, Mississippi, with its extremely high prevalence, also faces tight early restrictions, even with lower total flow, because each traveler represents a significant risk. Arizona, with moderate prevalence and high flow, also sees early restrictions. Virginia, being the lowest risk, is managed with a more even distribution. This differentiated approach ensures that the most impactful sources of potential infection are addressed proactively. The policy balances risk across weeks and states. For higher-risk states like Texas, Arizona, and Mississippi, a 'strict-first' approach is adopted, meaning a higher proportion of the total flow is deferred to later weeks. This front-loads the control, reducing the immediate influx of potential infections into new mexico. This strategy aims to flatten the curve of imported cases, giving new mexico's healthcare system more time to manage its internal epidemic dynamics (e.g., reducing its own E and I populations). By pushing more traffic to later weeks, there's an implicit assumption that new mexico's internal situation might improve, or that later weeks might offer better testing/quarantine capabilities. The total inbound flow for each state remains constant over the 6 weeks, ensuring that the economic and social functions tied to mobility are eventually met, but with an optimized temporal distribution to minimize public health impact. The effectiveness of these policies is sensitive to several factors. If the actual prevalence (I+E) in origin states is higher than estimated from the 21-day averages, the expected number of imported infections would be greater, necessitating even stricter initial controls. Conversely, if prevalence is lower, some early restrictions could potentially be eased. Similarly, variations in new mexico's internal transmission rate (beta) or its healthcare capacity (influenced by delta) would alter the optimal strategy. A higher beta in new mexico would mean imported cases spread faster, demanding even tighter border controls. If new mexico's delta (quarantine rate) were lower, internal spread from imported cases would be harder to contain, making proactive border control even more critical. These fractions are based on current data and assume stable epidemiological parameters; significant shifts would require re-evaluation and adjustment of the weekly allocations."

States with a higher ratio of Infected (I) to Susceptible (S) population (e.g., Mississippi) are subject to more stringent control in earlier weeks (higher initial fractions to front-load essential travel, with a subsequent reduction to mitigate sustained risk). States with lower I/S ratios (e.g., New Mexico) receive a more even distribution of flow, reflecting a lower perceived risk. For states with large populations and moderate I counts (e.g., Texas, Arizona), a 'relaxed-first' or gradually increasing flow pattern is adopted, allowing for essential movement while monitoring trends. This quantitative cooperation logic aims to smooth the importation of potential infections over the 6-week period, preventing sudden surges. The weekly proportions are calibrated to distribute the total ground truth flow over 6 weeks while attempting to front-load or back-load based on current risk assessments. For instance, Mississippi's relatively high I/S ratio leads to a slightly higher initial allocation, but with a plateau or slight reduction, to manage immediate risk. Conversely, Arizona and Texas, despite their large total flows, have a slightly increasing trend, reflecting a more cautious approach to ramp up. This strategy aims to reduce the peak burden on Virginia's healthcare system. Sensitivity reasoning suggests that if beta (infection rate) in Virginia or origin states were to increase, or if prevalence (I/S) were higher than estimated, the proposed 'relaxed-first' or increasing patterns would need to be re-evaluated towards stricter, 'strict-first' approaches to prevent overwhelming local resources. Conversely, if origin states show rapid improvements in their SEIQRD metrics, more relaxed policies could be considered without compromising Virginia's epidemic control."
