This pattern balances initial caution with increasing mobility. The trade-off is a slight initial restriction on mobility for better early epidemic control. The fractions sum to 0.16 + 0.16 + 0.17 + 0.17 + 0.17 + 0.17 = 1.00."

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound allocations are designed to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Texas by strategically managing imported infection risk. States with higher current (E+I)/S ratios (e.g., Mississippi) receive a 'strict-first' allocation, meaning higher flow earlier to potentially capture a period of lower internal Texas prevalence, or to reduce flow when Texas's internal prevalence might be higher later, thereby limiting the maximum potential for imported cases. States with moderate risk (Arizona, Virginia) adopt a 'relaxed-first' approach, gradually increasing flow to allow Texas to adapt to its internal dynamics while accommodating increasing mobility. New Mexico, with its very low risk, maintains an 'even' distribution, prioritizing consistent mobility. This risk balancing across weeks and states aims to smooth the influx of potential infections, preventing large spikes while maintaining a baseline level of mobility. For instance, if Texas's internal E/I population is projected to peak in later weeks, reducing inbound flow from high-risk states during those weeks would be beneficial. Conversely, if Texas is in a trough, higher flow might be permissible. The current strategy assumes a relatively stable internal epidemic in Texas, allowing for a gradual increase in overall mobility from moderate-risk states. Sensitivity to prevalence or beta variations is crucial: if a state's prevalence (E+I) significantly increases, its 'fractions' should be re-evaluated to become stricter, particularly in earlier weeks. Conversely, if Texas's beta (infection rate) were higher, a stricter policy across all states would be warranted to prevent rapid escalation of imported cases, potentially shifting towards more 'strict-first' patterns even for moderate-risk states.

  "global_guidance": "This multi-state traffic control policy for Texas aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically managing inbound mobility over the next six weeks. The core principle is to balance the fixed total inbound flow from each origin state with the objective of reducing the immediate burden of imported infections on Texas.\n\n**Cross-state reasoning:** We observe a wide range of infection risks among the origin states, primarily driven by their respective (E+I) prevalence rates. Mississippi poses the highest risk (0.049520), followed by Virginia (0.004523) and Arizona (0.003504), while New Mexico presents the lowest risk (0.000709), even lower than Texas's own prevalence (0.001217). Our strategy is to differentiate control stringency based on this risk profile. States with higher infection prevalence face stricter controls in early weeks, deferring a larger proportion of their allowed total flow to later weeks. Conversely, New Mexico, with its low prevalence, experiences a relatively more even distribution of its flow, as its contribution to imported cases is minimal. This collective approach aims to flatten the curve of potential imported infections across all sources, preventing a simultaneous surge.\n\n**Quantitative cooperation logic:** The estimated Reproduction Number (R0) for Texas, based on the provided SEIRD parameters (beta/gamma ¡Ö 1.32), suggests that the epidemic is likely to grow internally. In such a scenario, early introductions of additional infected individuals can have a disproportionately larger impact due to the compounding effect of an R0 > 1. By implementing a 'strict-first, relaxed-later' pattern for higher-risk states, we effectively shift a portion of the infection burden to later weeks. While the total number of imported infected individuals from each state remains constant over the six weeks, delaying their arrival allows for more time for Texas's population to potentially develop immunity, for public health interventions to take effect, or for healthcare capacity to adapt. This temporal redistribution of risk aims to reduce the peak demand on healthcare resources and, consequently, lower cumulative cases and deaths.\n\n**Sensitivity reasoning:** The effectiveness of this policy is sensitive to several factors. Firstly, the assumption of static (E+I) prevalence rates in origin states is a simplification. If an origin state's prevalence significantly changes (e.g., a high-risk state experiences a rapid decline, or a low-risk state sees a surge), the allocated fractions might need dynamic adjustment. Secondly, changes in Texas's internal epidemic dynamics, such as a substantial drop in R0 below 1 due to successful interventions or a rise due to new variants, would alter the optimal timing of imported cases. For instance, if Texas achieves strong control, the urgency to defer imports might lessen. Lastly, the model for imported infections (`Flow * ft * prevalence`) is a linear approximation; real-world complexities like heterogeneous mixing, super-spreading events, or localized outbreaks could introduce variability not captured here. Continuous monitoring of both origin and destination state epidemiological data is crucial for adapting this policy."

This places Virginia as a high-risk state for importing infections into Texas. To effectively manage the potential for imported cases, weekly imported infections (`Flow * ft * ((I+E)/Population)`) are actively reduced in the initial weeks by assigning lower `ft` values.

This is achieved by implementing a differentiated approach based on the perceived infection risk of each origin state, primarily assessed by its `(I+E)/Population` ratio. States posing a higher risk (e.g., Mississippi, Virginia, Arizona) are subjected to stricter controls in the initial weeks, meaning a lower proportion of their total 6-week inbound flow is permitted. Conversely, states with lower risk (e.g., New Mexico) have their flow distributed more evenly. This staggered approach aims to flatten the curve of imported infections, preventing a large influx of potentially infectious individuals when Texas might be most vulnerable or its healthcare system is under strain.\n\nBy front-loading restrictions on high-risk states, we reduce the initial `I` and `E` contributions to Texas's population. The formula `imported_infected_weekly ~ Total_Inflow_from_state * ft * ((I+E)_state / Population_state)` highlights how `ft` is the control lever. Lower `ft` in early weeks for high-risk states directly translates to fewer imported infections when the epidemic potential is highest. As weeks progress, and assuming Texas's internal epidemic response is effective or the origin states' prevalence declines, the `ft` values for these states gradually increase, allowing the full baseline mobility to be met without overwhelming the system. This temporal redistribution of constant total flow is a key mechanism for balancing epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs.\n\nThe effectiveness of this policy is sensitive to several factors. If Texas's `beta` (transmission rate) were to increase significantly, the existing internal epidemic would accelerate, making it even more crucial to apply stricter 'strict-first' policies across all origin states, regardless of their individual risk, to prevent any additional burden. Conversely, a lower `beta` might allow for more relaxed initial controls. Furthermore, the accuracy of the `(I+E)/Population` data from origin states is critical. If actual prevalence is higher than estimated, the policy might be insufficient. If the `(I+E)/Population` ratios in origin states are projected to decrease over the 6-week period, a 'relaxed-first' or even 'wave' pattern might become more appropriate for some states. Without such projections, the 'strict-first' approach for higher-risk states serves as a conservative measure to minimize immediate adverse impacts."

States posing a higher risk (e.g., Mississippi, Virginia, Arizona) are subjected to stricter controls in the initial weeks, meaning a lower proportion of their total 6-week inbound flow is permitted. Conversely, states with lower risk (e.g., New Mexico) have their flow distributed more evenly. This staggered approach aims to flatten the curve of imported infections, preventing a large influx of potentially infectious individuals when Texas might be most vulnerable or its healthcare system is under strain.\n\nBy front-loading restrictions on high-risk states, we reduce the initial `I` and `E` contributions to Texas's population. The formula `imported_infected_weekly ~ Total_Inflow_from_state * ft * ((I+E)_state / Population_state)` highlights how `ft` is the control lever. Lower `ft` in early weeks for high-risk states directly translates to fewer imported infections when the epidemic potential is highest. As weeks progress, and assuming Texas's internal epidemic response is effective or the origin states' prevalence declines, the `ft` values for these states gradually increase, allowing the full baseline mobility to be met without overwhelming the system. This temporal redistribution of constant total flow is a key mechanism for balancing epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs.\n\nThe effectiveness of this policy is sensitive to several factors. If Texas's `beta` (transmission rate) were to increase significantly, the existing internal epidemic would accelerate, making it even more crucial to apply stricter 'strict-first' policies across all origin states, regardless of their individual risk, to prevent any additional burden. Conversely, a lower `beta` might allow for more relaxed initial controls. Furthermore, the accuracy of the `(I+E)/Population` data from origin states is critical. If actual prevalence is higher than estimated, the policy might be insufficient. If the `(I+E)/Population` ratios in origin states are projected to decrease over the 6-week period, a 'relaxed-first' or even 'wave' pattern might become more appropriate for some states. Without such projections, the 'strict-first' approach for higher-risk states serves as a conservative measure to minimize immediate adverse impacts."

    "notes": "Arizona exhibits a moderate E and I population relative to its total population. The past 21-day average shows a significant number of exposed individuals (122,311) and a notable 'I' count (7,980), suggesting a potential for imported infections. The 'Q' and 'R' values are also high, indicating a past outbreak that is still being managed. Quantitative logic for imported infections follows: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (E + I) / Population. Given the moderate but persistent infection pressure, a 'strict-first' approach is adopted for the first three weeks, followed by a slight relaxation. This aims to minimize initial imported cases while allowing for increased mobility later if the situation stabilizes. The fractions sum to 0.15+0.15+0.15+0.2+0.2+0.15 = 1.00."

    "notes": "Mississippi presents a high infection risk relative to its population size, with very high E (108,199) and I (45,109) values for a smaller state. This suggests active and widespread transmission. The 'Q' and 'R' values are also substantial, indicating a significant epidemic history. Imported infections are expected to be high: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (E + I) / Population. To mitigate this, a 'strict-first, relaxed-later' pattern is implemented, with the lowest fractions in the initial weeks to heavily restrict flow when the risk is highest. This prioritizes epidemic control over mobility in the short term, hoping for an improvement in Mississippi's internal situation to allow for more flow later.

    "notes": "New Mexico shows relatively low E (14,121) and I (3,214) values compared to its population and other states, suggesting a lower immediate infection pressure. The 'Q' and 'R' values are moderate. Imported infections are thus expected to be lower: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (E + I) / Population. Given the lower risk, a slightly 'relaxed-first' approach is adopted, allowing for more initial inbound flow. This pattern balances mobility needs with epidemic control, as the current infection rates appear manageable. The slightly reduced flow in later weeks acts as a precautionary measure, assuming potential fluctuations. The fractions sum to 0.2+0.2+0.15+0.15+0.15+0.15 = 1.00."

    "notes": "Virginia has a moderate to high number of E (108,056) and I (25,959) cases, similar to Arizona, indicating an ongoing but perhaps more controlled epidemic than Mississippi. The 'Q' and 'R' values are significant. Imported infections are a concern: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (E + I) / Population. The strategy here is a 'balanced' approach, with a slight relaxation in the middle weeks. This aims to manage the risk by not being overly strict initially but also not fully relaxing, allowing for flexibility based on how the epidemic evolves. The pattern reflects a cautious optimism that the situation might improve or remain stable, enabling a slight increase in flow. The fractions sum to 0.15+0.15+0.2+0.2+0.15+0.15 = 1.00."
