      "notes": "For Arizona, we have observed a significant number of confirmed cases and deaths over the past 21 days. By implementing a strict-first pattern, we aim to initially reduce the inbound traffic to contain the spread of the virus. The expected imported infections are directly proportional to the inbound flow, infected cases, and population. Therefore, we recommend a gradual relaxation in traffic control measures to balance epidemic control and mobility while minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in New Mexico.
