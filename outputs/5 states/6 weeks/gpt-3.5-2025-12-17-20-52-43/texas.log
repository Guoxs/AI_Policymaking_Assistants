This cooperative strategy reduces the cumulative imported infections and deaths in Texas by suppressing early seeding events that could amplify local transmission. Quantitatively, allocations balance the total inbound flow constraint while adjusting weekly proportions to reduce risk when prevalence is highest. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become even more crucial to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta reduces, more relaxed early allocations could be considered. The chosen strict-first pattern across states balances epidemic control with mobility needs, offering a practical and effective approach to managing cross-state traffic during ongoing disease spread.'

This temporal staggering minimizes simultaneous importation peaks that could exacerbate Texas's epidemic. Risk balancing ensures that total inflow remains constant but distributed to reduce early pressure on Texas's healthcare. Sensitivity analysis indicates that higher beta or prevalence would necessitate stricter early controls; conversely, lower prevalence allows more relaxed policies. These allocations optimize the trade-off between epidemic suppression and economic mobility by adapting weekly flows based on origin state risk profiles and Texas's current epidemic status."

States with lower prevalence like New Mexico have more relaxed flows later to support mobility. This cross-state risk balancing reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths in Texas by preventing simultaneous peak importation pressure. The quantitative cooperation logic uses infection prevalence ratios and flow baselines to distribute restrictions temporally, mitigating risk peaks without reducing total flow. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if beta or prevalence increases, stricter early controls become more critical to curb importations, while lower beta or prevalence may allow more relaxed policies. Overall, this policy minimizes Texas' epidemic burden by dynamically managing imported infection risks through temporal traffic control allocations."

New Mexico receives milder, more even restrictions reflecting its lower infection prevalence, while Arizona has moderate front-loaded restrictions. This cross-state strategy minimizes cumulative infections and deaths by reducing peak imported infectious cases early, which is when Texas is most vulnerable and less recovered. The total inbound flows remain constant, preserving economic activity but shifting timing to balance epidemic control and mobility needs. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter front-loading would be more critical, whereas if these decrease, controls could be more evenly distributed. This dynamic allocation adapts to relative risk and epidemic timing, enhancing overall epidemic resilience for Texas."

Moderate and low-risk states (New Mexico, Mississippi) receive stricter early controls but with some allowance for mobility to balance economic and social needs. This cross-state coordination reduces the cumulative risk of new infections in Texas by lowering initial seeding events across all weeks. The 6-week horizon allows gradual relaxation, mitigating long-term economic impact without compromising epidemic control. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls should be amplified, especially for states with higher I and E values. Conversely, if prevalence declines, more even or relaxed-first patterns may be warranted. This dynamic balance achieves optimal mitigation of confirmed and deceased cases in Texas while maintaining necessary inbound mobility.'

Arizona and New Mexico, with lower or moderate infection pressure, have more balanced or relaxed-first patterns, maintaining economic activity. This cooperative balancing reduces the overall imported infection burden, easing healthcare strain. Quantitatively, by adjusting weekly fractions while keeping total inflow constant, we smooth infection importation risk rather than allowing peaks. Sensitivity to varying transmission rates (beta) or prevalence would adjust strictness timing but the pattern of front-loading restrictions on higher-risk states remains robust. This policy supports epidemic control goals while enabling phased mobility recovery."
