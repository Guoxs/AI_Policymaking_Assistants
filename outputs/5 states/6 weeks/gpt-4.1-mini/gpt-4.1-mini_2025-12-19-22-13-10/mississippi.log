The imported infected cases roughly scale as Flow * ft * (I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)), indicating infection pressure proportional to I fraction. Given a slightly decreasing infection trend, a strict-first pattern is adopted, reducing inflow more in the initial weeks to curb early importation, then easing controls gradually to balance mobility needs.
