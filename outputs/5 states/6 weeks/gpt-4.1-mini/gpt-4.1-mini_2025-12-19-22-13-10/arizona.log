High daily inflow (57130.62) means imported infections significantly impact Arizona. The strict-first pattern is chosen, with very low fractions early to minimize early imported cases, increasing flow later as the local epidemic stabilizes. This reduces cumulative cases and deaths by curbing early seeding. There's a trade-off of stringent early restrictions vs. later relaxation to balance economy and public health.

States with lower infection prevalence or inflow (New Mexico, Virginia) have moderately relaxed or even allocations to sustain essential mobility. The cumulative imported infections roughly follow the formula sum_over_weeks(Flow * ft * (I/population)), so concentrating stricter control early reduces cumulative infectious seeding. This strategy balances public health protection and economic activity. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) increases, stricter early controls would yield greater benefits, whereas lower prevalence allows more relaxed policies.
