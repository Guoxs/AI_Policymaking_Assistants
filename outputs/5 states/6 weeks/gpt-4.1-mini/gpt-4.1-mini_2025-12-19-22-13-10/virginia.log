Imported infected cases roughly scale with Flow*ft*(I/pop), so reducing early week flows (f1=0.25 to f6=0.10) helps cut initial importation risk when local virginia prevalence is still high. This decreasing pattern (strict-first) balances epidemic control by frontloading restrictions while allowing gradual relaxation. Trade-off favors early containment to minimize imported seeding.

The allocation is slightly relaxed mid-period (weeks 3 and 4 at 0.20) but maintains steady control otherwise, reflecting moderate infection risk with some mobility allowance. Imported infected cases scale similarly with Flow*ft*(I/pop). This pattern balances epidemic control and mobility by avoiding spikes early but allowing some flow mid-term when virginia control measures improve. Fractions sum to 1.00 exactly."

The fraction pattern is relaxed-first, starting stricter early (0.10) then increasing to 0.20 in later weeks. This leverages the low infection risk to allow more flow later when local virginia infections may decline. Imported infected scales with Flow*ft*(I/pop).

The fractions are mostly even to slightly stricter later (0.15) to ensure steady control and avoid late import spikes. This even-to-strict-late pattern helps reduce sustained importation risk while allowing moderate mobility. Imported infected cases scale as Flow*ft*(I/pop).

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocations prioritize minimizing imported infections by modulating flow fractions based on each origin state's infection prevalence and population size.

Lower prevalence states (new mexico) have more relaxed late-period allowances to sustain mobility without much risk. The total inbound flow per origin remains constant, but redistributing weekly fractions reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths by flattening arrival of infected individuals. This coordinated approach balances epidemic risk and mobility needs across states. Sensitivity analyses show that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls would be needed to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, lower prevalence or faster recovery would allow more relaxed flows. The policy is robust to moderate parameter uncertainty by frontloading restrictions where risk is highest."

    "notes": "Arizona shows moderate exposed (120427) and infected (7763) populations relative to its large susceptible base (8.5M). The expected imported infections can be estimated roughly as Flow*ft*(I/population), where I/population ~ 0.00091. Given a high inflow (6041 daily), a strict-first pattern is chosen to front-load restrictions when risk is higher and relax later. This helps reduce immediate importation of infections into Virginia. Trade-offs include slightly reduced mobility early on, but this minimizes seeding new cases that could escalate. The fractions sum to exactly 1.00, ensuring total flow consistency."

With moderate inflow (4887.67), strict-first control is key to prevent large importation of infected individuals early on. The risk to Virginia is higher here per inbound traveler, so more aggressive early restrictions reduce potential seeded cases. The fractions are balanced to maintain flow sum = 1.
