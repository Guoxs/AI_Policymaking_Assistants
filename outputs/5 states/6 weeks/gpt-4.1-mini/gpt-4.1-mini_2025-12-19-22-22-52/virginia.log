This balances epidemic control with mobility, prioritizing early suppression to avoid amplification in Virginia. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound flow allocations collectively prioritize early strict control for states with higher infection prevalence (Texas, Mississippi, Arizona) to minimize initial seeding of infections in Virginia, thereby reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases.

The strategy leverages temporal traffic control, lowering fractions early (weeks 1-3) when risk of importation is highest and relaxing them later as local epidemic control in Virginia improves. Quantitatively, this reduces the product of flow and prevalence over high-risk weeks, minimizing imported infections. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls become more critical, while lower beta allows for more relaxed allocations.
