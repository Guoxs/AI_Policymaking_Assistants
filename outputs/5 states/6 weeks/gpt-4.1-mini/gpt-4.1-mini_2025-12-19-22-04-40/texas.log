Given the moderately high infection prevalence, a 'strict-first' pattern is chosen to minimize early importation risk by front-loading stricter control (lower fractions) in early weeks when infection risk is high, then gradually relaxing controls.

The quantitative logic is based on the formula: imported infected ~ Flow * fraction * (I / population), emphasizing reducing early fractions from states with higher infection prevalence.

The infected proportion is relatively low, but exposed individuals (E=28,482) are high, indicating potential future cases. Expected imported infections are proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing flow earlier when infection pressure could increase is advisable. The allocation uses a strict-first pattern, imposing stricter controls initially (lower fractions in weeks 3-6) to reduce early importation risk while allowing some relaxation in the first two weeks to balance mobility needs. This gradual tightening helps minimize cumulative cases in Texas by lowering imported infections early. The fractions sum exactly to 1.0000."
