By gradually relaxing control over the 6 weeks, the strategy balances epidemic control with mobility needs, avoiding prolonged economic disruption. Quantitatively, imported infections are proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population); thus, reducing ft in early weeks for states with higher I or inflow effectively lowers overall imported risk. Coordination across states ensures peak infection importation is staggered and suppressed. Sensitivity analysis suggests if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter and longer front-loading would be required; conversely, if these decrease, relaxation can be accelerated.
