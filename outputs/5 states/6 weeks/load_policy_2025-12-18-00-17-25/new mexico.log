By concentrating traffic restrictions in the first two to three weeks, we minimize early seeding events that could amplify local transmission. The total daily inbound flow from each origin state remains constant over six weeks, but the weighted fractions reduce early week flow to lower infection importation risk, balancing epidemic control and mobility. This cooperative strategy leverages temporal smoothing of imported risk to flatten local incidence. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence increases or transmission rate beta rises, stricter early week controls are even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, controls can be relaxed sooner. Adjusting week-by-week fractions allows flexible responses to evolving epidemic dynamics and mobility needs, optimizing health outcomes while preserving essential travel.'

Texas, with a large population but moderate prevalence, is managed with a more balanced distribution to prevent sudden import surges while maintaining mobility. This coordinated approach balances epidemic control and mobility by smoothing importation risk over time and across states, reducing cumulative infections and deaths locally. If prevalence or beta varies, stricter early restrictions would become more critical to prevent exponential local spread. Cooperation in timing and volume control reduces peak pressure on New Mexico's health system and allows adaptive response to epidemic dynamics."

The strict-first pattern is consistently chosen due to the relatively high prevalence of exposed and infected individuals in other states, especially Mississippi and Arizona. By front-loading restrictions, the epidemic curve in New Mexico can be flattened, preventing overwhelming healthcare capacity. Quantitatively, distributing the 6-week fractions to sum to one ensures total traffic volume remains unchanged, preserving economic connectivity while minimizing epidemic risk. If infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, the benefit of early strict controls becomes more pronounced; conversely, lower prevalence may allow more even or relaxed-first allocations. This policy thus dynamically balances epidemic control and mobility by leveraging temporal traffic adjustments rather than reducing total traffic.'

This cooperative approach across states balances mobility needs while minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases.

The total inbound flow over 6 weeks remains constant for each state, ensuring fairness and predictability in mobility. The distribution of fractions is weighted to reduce importation pressure when prevalence is high and gradually relax controls as infection dynamics improve or stabilize. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if the transmission rate beta or prevalence in origin states increases, stricter early restrictions or longer durations of low fractions would be needed. Conversely, lower prevalence or beta allows more relaxed traffic patterns. This approach balances epidemic control and mobility needs through dynamic, state-specific weekly allocations.'

By redistributing the fixed total inbound flow over 6 weeks with lower fractions early on and higher fractions later, the policy reduces the risk of immediate imported infections and subsequent local transmission. This cooperative balancing acts as a temporal buffer allowing New Mexico's epidemic dynamics to stabilize, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths. Sensitivity to changes in beta or prevalence would alter optimal fractions, with higher transmission rates favoring even stricter early controls. The approach is robust to uncertainties, prioritizing epidemic containment alongside gradual mobility restoration."
