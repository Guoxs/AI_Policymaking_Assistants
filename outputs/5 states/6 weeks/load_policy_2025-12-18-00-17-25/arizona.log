Texas, with lower infection rates, has a more balanced allocation to sustain mobility. This cross-state strategy balances epidemic control and economic activity by shifting inbound traffic to later weeks when infection pressure may decrease or when Arizona's own epidemic status may be more manageable. Quantitatively, we balance the sum of Flow * ft * (I/population) across states and weeks to minimize cumulative imported infections and deaths. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence drops, more relaxed schedules can be considered. This approach ensures flexibility and robustness in traffic policies to mitigate COVID-19 spread effectively."

New Mexico, with lower infections, is given a relaxed-first pattern to maintain mobility while monitoring risks. This staggered approach balances epidemic control and economic mobility needs. Quantitatively, imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/population); thus, reducing ft early for high-risk origins lowers cumulative cases and deaths. Sensitivity to beta and prevalence suggests that if transmission rates or infection prevalence increase, the strict-first pattern's importance rises. Coordination across states ensures Arizona's epidemic curve is flattened by delaying and reducing imported infections, enabling better local response and healthcare capacity management."

States with higher infection prevalence (Mississippi, Texas) have stricter controls front-loaded to reduce early seeding, while lower prevalence states (New Mexico) have relaxed controls later to maintain mobility. Virginia's moderate risk is handled with an even distribution to avoid spikes in importation. This cross-state approach balances the total incoming flow while minimizing cumulative infections and fatalities by reducing peak importation risk. The sensitivity of this policy is high to prevalence and transmission rate (beta); if infections rise, stricter front-loaded controls become more beneficial, while lower beta values reduce the necessity for very strict early restrictions. Cooperation across weeks and states helps spread the risk temporally and spatially, allowing Arizona to manage its epidemic curve more effectively."

States with lower prevalence or inflow (New Mexico, Virginia) receive more balanced or slightly relaxed early allocations, balancing economic activity and risk. This cross-state approach reduces overall imported infections by flattening the importation curve temporally and distributing risk across weeks. The total flow per state remains constant, maintaining fairness. Sensitivity to parameters like beta or I prevalence suggests that if transmission rates or prevalence rise, stricter early controls would provide more benefit, while reductions allow more relaxed policies.

States with higher infection prevalence (Virginia, Texas) or high inflow (New Mexico) receive stricter early traffic controls (lower fraction in initial weeks) to reduce early imported seeding, followed by gradual relaxation as epidemic pressure stabilizes. Lower prevalence states with moderate inflow (Mississippi) also follow a strict-first pattern but with less aggressive early restrictions. The total inbound flow per state remains constant over 6 weeks, redistributing weekly proportions to concentrate stricter control early when imported infection risk is highest. This coordinated approach leverages temporal risk dynamics, reducing cumulative imported infections and deaths in Arizona. Sensitivity analyses show that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls would be more beneficial; conversely, if prevalence decreases, a more relaxed pattern could be tolerated. Balancing epidemic control and mobility enables sustainable policy to protect public health while maintaining essential travel flows.'

The approach reduces cumulative confirmed and deceased by flattening the epidemic curve and preventing early surges. Later weeks have progressively relaxed controls (higher fractions) to restore mobility while local immunity or control measures mitigate risk. Cross-state risk balancing considers infection prevalence and inbound flows to allocate restrictions where risk is highest initially. Sensitivity analysis shows that higher beta or I would warrant even stricter early controls; lower prevalence or stronger local controls could allow more mobility earlier. This balanced approach optimizes epidemic control and economic activity over the 6-week horizon.'
