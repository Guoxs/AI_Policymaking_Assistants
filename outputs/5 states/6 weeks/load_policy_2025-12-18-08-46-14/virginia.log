States with lower infection prevalence (Texas, New Mexico) have more balanced or relaxed-first patterns to maintain economic mobility while managing risk. This cross-state cooperation ensures that cumulative imported infections and deaths are minimized by smoothing inbound flows, preventing large influxes during periods of high risk. The strategy is sensitive to infection prevalence and transmission rate beta; if either increases, stricter early controls would be warranted. Conversely, lower infection rates or beta could justify more relaxed patterns. This approach balances epidemic control with socio-economic costs, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant but temporally optimized to reduce disease spread.'

States with lower infection prevalence (New Mexico) have more balanced or slightly relaxed-first patterns to maintain mobility while controlling risk. This cross-state balancing leverages differing epidemic intensities and flow volumes to minimize cumulative infections in Virginia. By front-loading restrictions when Virginia's local infection is still significant, the policy reduces initial seeding that can amplify local outbreaks. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter front-loading would be even more beneficial, while lower beta or prevalence would allow more relaxed patterns. This quantitative cooperation across states and weeks ensures the total inbound flow remains constant, but timing is optimized to curb Virginia's epidemic growth while preserving essential mobility."

States with higher infected proportions (Mississippi, Texas) have stricter early controls, reducing imported infections when Virginia is most vulnerable. Lower risk states (New Mexico, Arizona) have more moderate or delayed restrictions balancing economic and social factors. The total inbound flow per state remains constant, redistributing weekly proportions to flatten infection import peaks and leverage epidemiological parameters such as beta and delta. Sensitivity analysis indicates that higher transmission rates or prevalence would require stricter early controls, especially from high-risk states. Coordinated cross-state timing reduces cumulative epidemic impact more effectively than uniform or random allocations.'

Lower-risk states like New Mexico have more relaxed early traffic to maintain mobility while contributing minimal infection risk. This staggered approach balances epidemic control with economic and social mobility, recognizing that delaying infections reduces cumulative cases due to epidemic dynamics and possible improved healthcare responses. The total inbound flow per state remains constant, preserving overall mobility. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become more critical, whereas lower prevalence or beta could allow more relaxed policies.

The cooperation strategy balances risk over weeks and states, preventing simultaneous high-risk inflows and smoothing demand.

Lower fractions early reduce the seeding of new cases, leveraging the incubation and confirmation delays (alpha and delta parameters) to curtail spread. New Mexico's low infection levels justified an even allocation to maintain mobility. Balancing traffic over 6 weeks with strict-first patterns for higher prevalence states minimizes cumulative infections and deaths. If prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early control would be more critical. Conversely, reduced prevalence or transmission could allow more relaxed early fractions. Coordination across states ensures that flow is not concentrated in high-risk weeks or sources, optimizing epidemic control while maintaining essential mobility."
