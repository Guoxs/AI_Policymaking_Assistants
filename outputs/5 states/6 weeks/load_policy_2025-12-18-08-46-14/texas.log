States with higher infection prevalence relative to population (mississippi, virginia) see stronger early restrictions to minimize imported infections, leveraging the incubation and confirmation delays in the SEIQRD model to reduce seeding into Texas. New Mexico, with very high flow but moderate infection levels, receives a more balanced relaxed-first pattern to sustain mobility while controlling import risks. Arizona is controlled strictly early due to moderate infection and flow. The total inbound flow per origin state remains constant over 6 weeks, preserving economic activity while optimizing timing to minimize cumulative infections and deaths in Texas. Sensitivity to beta and infection prevalence suggests that higher transmissibility or rising infections would require stricter early restrictions, while lower risk could allow more even or relaxed patterns. This cooperative weekly balancing reduces epidemic pressure on Texas healthcare and supports adaptive epidemic control.'

This cross-state coordination balances infection pressure, preventing spikes in Texas by reducing seeding early and allowing gradual relaxation as local conditions stabilize. Quantitatively, distributing traffic to weeks with lower infection prevalence and lower transmission potential reduces cumulative imported infections approximately proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population). Sensitivity analysis suggests that if transmission rate (beta) or prevalence rises, stricter early controls become even more critical; conversely, if prevalence drops, traffic can be more evenly distributed. This policy thus dynamically balances epidemic control and economic mobility in a coordinated, data-driven manner.'

Origins with higher infectious and exposed prevalence (Mississippi, Virginia, Arizona) have stricter early reductions to minimize seeding risk into Texas. Lower prevalence states (New Mexico) have more balanced or slightly relaxed patterns to maintain mobility. This cross-state coordination balances epidemic control with economic activity by redistributing flow over time while keeping total volume constant. Sensitivity analysis suggests if beta or prevalence rises, stricter early restrictions become more critical to prevent exponential spread. If prevalence declines faster than expected, controls can be eased sooner. The approach leverages quantitative infection scaling (imported infected ~ Flow*ft*I/population) to allocate flow fractions dynamically, minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Texas over the next 6 weeks.'

States with higher infection prevalence (mississippi, arizona, virginia) have stricter controls in later weeks (strict-first pattern) to flatten importation peaks and prevent overwhelming local health systems. New Mexico, having low prevalence, is allowed relatively more flow early and mid-period (relaxed-first pattern) to preserve economic activity. This cross-state risk balancing reduces the overall force of infection imported into Texas across 6 weeks. Quantitatively, imported infections scale as Flow*ft*(I/population), so adjusting ft over time redistributes risk to manageable levels. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter and earlier controls would be required to maintain similar epidemic control. Conversely, if prevalence drops, restrictions can be relaxed earlier. This dynamic allocation enables adaptive epidemic control while respecting mobility and economic trade-offs.'

This balances epidemic control and economic mobility by smoothing infection pressure over 6 weeks. Quantitatively, imported infected cases are roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing ft in early weeks for high-prevalence states curbs early seeding. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early reductions are even more critical. Conversely, lower prevalence allows more relaxed flows. This coordinated approach minimizes cumulative cases and deaths by flattening the imported infection curve while maintaining total inbound flow constant per state as required.'

By applying stricter controls earlier (strict-first pattern) for higher-risk states like Arizona and Mississippi, we reduce initial introductions which could amplify the epidemic. For lower-risk New Mexico, an even allocation balances epidemic control with economic needs. Virginia's relaxed-first approach reflects anticipated epidemic dynamics and allows gradual reopening. The fractions sum to 1 for each state, preserving total inbound flow. This cross-state balancing reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths by spreading restrictions temporally and spatially. Sensitivity analyses show that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increase, stricter early controls become more critical; conversely, if these decrease, more even or relaxed policies may suffice. This coordinated strategy minimizes epidemic resurgence risk while maintaining mobility."
