States with higher infected and exposed populations per capita (Virginia, New Mexico, Mississippi) receive stricter early controls (strict-first pattern), reducing immediate imported infections and deaths. Texas, with lower per capita infections, follows a relaxed-first pattern to maintain economic mobility while managing risk. The total inbound flows over 6 weeks per state remain constant, preserving baseline mobility but shifting temporal distribution to reduce peak importation. This coordinated approach balances epidemic control and economic impact by frontloading restrictions where risk is highest and easing when risk declines. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early reductions become more critical to avoid seeding local outbreaks. Conversely, lower prevalence or beta supports more relaxed early flows. Overall, this allocation minimizes cumulative infections and deaths in Arizona by managing imported infection pressure dynamically and proportionally across origin states and weeks.'

New Mexico's low prevalence allows gradual relaxation to support mobility without significant risk. Texas's large population and moderate prevalence motivate an even distribution to avoid sudden spikes. Quantitatively, imported infections are approximated by Flow*ft*(I/population), so adjusting ft by week controls inflow risk temporally. This coordinated temporal control across states balances maintaining essential mobility with minimizing imported infections and deaths. Sensitivity analyses show that higher beta or prevalence would favor more front-loaded strict control, while lower parameters allow more even or relaxed-first patterns. This policy thus dynamically adapts to infection pressure and mobility needs to optimize epidemic control in Arizona."

Lower-risk states (New Mexico) are allowed more relaxed flow early to maintain essential mobility, with gradual adjustments. Even distribution is used for moderate-risk states like Virginia to avoid fluctuations. This balance minimizes cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by flattening infection import peaks, leveraging the SEIQRD parameters where beta drives transmission and delta indicates quick confirmation rates. By distributing the total inbound flow over 6 weeks without altering the total volume, we maintain economic and social connectivity while mitigating epidemic risk. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or beta increases, stricter early controls would be even more beneficial. Conversely, lower prevalence allows more relaxed policies. This coordinated temporal and cross-state approach optimizes risk reduction and mobility preservation.'

Lower prevalence states (New Mexico) have relaxed controls later, balancing mobility needs and epidemic risk. This cross-state strategy reduces overall seeding pressure on Arizona's epidemic, flattening imported infection peaks. The proportional weekly fractions sum to 1 per state, ensuring total inbound flow consistency. Sensitivity analysis suggests if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta rise, stricter early controls should be intensified, especially from high prevalence origins. Conversely, improvements in local recovery rates or vaccination coverage could allow more relaxed inbound flows. This coordinated temporal and cross-state risk balancing minimizes cumulative cases and deaths while maintaining essential mobility."

This coordinated approach reduces imported infection pressure when Arizona's susceptible population is high, thereby lowering secondary transmission risks. Quantitatively, the sum of weekly fractions equals 1 for each state, preserving total inbound flow while redistributing temporal risk. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter or prolonged controls may be needed, especially for high-prevalence states.

States with lower infection prevalence like New Mexico receive relatively relaxed early controls to support mobility and economic activity. The total inbound flows remain constant by adjusting weekly fractions summing to 1, ensuring no overall traffic reduction bias. This cross-state and cross-week balancing reduces peak imported infection pressure, flattening the infection curve in Arizona. Sensitivity to parameter beta and prevalence shows that earlier strict control is more effective in high prevalence states, while low prevalence states can tolerate relaxed initial flow. The approach harmonizes epidemic control goals with socio-economic mobility needs.'
