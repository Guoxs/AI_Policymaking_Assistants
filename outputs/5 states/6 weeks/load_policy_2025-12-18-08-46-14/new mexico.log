Texas, with low infection prevalence, receives an even allocation to preserve mobility with minimal added risk. This cross-state balancing minimizes cumulative cases and deaths by front-loading restrictions where risk of importation is highest, while avoiding unnecessary disruptions from low-risk origins. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early reductions become even more critical to prevent exponential growth. Conversely, with lower prevalence, mobility can be more evenly distributed. This policy ensures total inbound flow per state remains constant while optimizing temporal distribution to minimize epidemic impact.'

By adopting a relaxed-first pattern for all states, we reduce early-week importation risks when New Mexicos local outbreak is sensitive to new infections. This staggered approach avoids overwhelming healthcare resources and reduces cumulative cases and deaths. The allocation respects total inbound flow constraints, ensuring mobility needs are met without increasing risk. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if transmission rates (beta) or infection prevalence increase, stricter early controls would be needed. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more even or relaxed distributions could be justified. This cooperative, week-wise balancing approach optimizes disease control while maintaining essential mobility across states.'

Arizona and Mississippi, with relatively higher infectious proportions, receive the strongest early constraints. Texas, due to its large flow, has moderate early restrictions to balance economic and public health concerns. Virginias smaller flow and moderate infection levels justify a similarly cautious phased approach. The total inbound flows remain constant, but weekly fractions shift traffic from early high-risk weeks to later lower-risk weeks, minimizing cumulative infections and deaths. This coordinated temporal shifting reduces simultaneous importation pressure, allowing New Mexicos healthcare system to better manage cases. Sensitivity analysis suggests if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early fractions would be needed, while lower prevalence or beta allow more relaxed patterns.

This strict-first temporal pattern reduces imported infections when New Mexico's susceptible population is most vulnerable. Quantitatively, by modeling imported infections as proportional to Flow*ft*(I/state_population), early traffic suppression reduces initial seeding. The allocations across states reflect balancing large inflows (e.g., Texas and Arizona) with their infection pressures, distributing risk over time. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if transmission rates (beta) or infected prevalence increase, stricter early controls would be even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence drops, allocations can shift toward relaxed-first patterns to restore mobility. This coordinated approach minimizes cross-state infection importation while maintaining essential travel, ultimately reducing New Mexico's epidemic burden."

This phased approach reduces immediate imported infections (calculated as Flow*ft*(I/pop)) across states, especially from high-prevalence origins like Texas and Virginia. The strategy balances epidemic control with economic and social mobility by avoiding prolonged harsh restrictions. Cooperation among states is implicit, as lowering flow early in high-risk origin states reduces secondary transmission in New Mexico. Sensitivity analysis suggests if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls should be intensified. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed flow can be allowed earlier. This approach adapts dynamically to evolving epidemic risks, minimizing cumulative infections and deaths while maintaining essential mobility.'

By deferring inbound flows to later weeks, we reduce the immediate importation pressure, allowing New Mexico's health system to manage and reduce local transmission. The approach balances mobility needs by gradually relaxing restrictions over six weeks, preventing economic stagnation. Quantitatively, imported infections are roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), so controlling ft early significantly lowers initial cases. Coordination across states ensures total flow volumes remain constant while timing is shifted to minimize overlapping peaks of imported infections. Sensitivity to changes in prevalence or transmission rate would require adjusting strictness timing; higher beta or prevalence would necessitate even earlier and stricter controls, while lower values could allow more even distribution. Overall, this strategy mitigates epidemic spread while maintaining baseline mobility over the 6-week horizon."
