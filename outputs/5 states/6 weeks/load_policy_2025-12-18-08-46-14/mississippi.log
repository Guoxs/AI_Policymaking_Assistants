This front-loading reduces seeding and helps flatten the curve locally. States with larger flows and higher infected counts (Texas, Virginia) have stronger early restrictions. Balancing traffic over time allows gradual economic activity resumption without overwhelming healthcare. The sum-to-one constraint ensures constant total flow per origin, maintaining fairness. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become even more critical. Conversely, if local Mississippi control improves, later week relaxations could be faster. Coordination across states balances imported infection pressure dynamically, reducing cumulative cases and deaths. This approach leverages epidemiological data and mobility baselines to optimize traffic policies for epidemic control and mobility.'

This approach delays and flattens infection importation peaks, allowing Mississippi's healthcare and containment measures to be more effective. Lower infection prevalence states (New Mexico and Arizona) receive similar but slightly less strict early restrictions, reflecting their lower risk. The total inbound flow is preserved per state, balancing mobility needs and epidemic control. Sensitivity to beta and infection prevalence suggests that if transmission rates or infected counts rise, stricter early restrictions would be necessary. Conversely, if prevalence falls, a more relaxed pattern could be adopted. This coordinated allocation across states and weeks reduces cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by controlling infection import timing and volume."

This approach minimizes the risk of seeding additional outbreaks by lowering imported infected cases proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population) across states. Collective early restrictions reduce cumulative infections and deaths by limiting new exposures and confirmed cases. Quantitative cooperation balances risk by allocating stricter controls when local prevalence is high and relaxing controls as local epidemic pressure diminishes. Sensitivity analysis shows that if beta (transmission rate) or prevalence increases, stricter early controls become even more critical to prevent exponential growth. Conversely, if prevalence or beta lowers, the relaxation phase could be accelerated. The strategy achieves a balanced trade-off between epidemic control and necessary mobility, preserving essential traffic flow while minimizing health risks across states and weeks.'

This reduces the initial importation of infected individuals, lowering cumulative confirmed and deceased in Mississippi. By concentrating restrictions early (weeks 1-3) and easing later, the policy balances epidemic control and mobility, allowing economic and social activities to gradually resume when infection pressure is lower. The quantitative cooperation logic distributes stricter control proportional to each state's infection pressure and flow magnitude, efficiently minimizing imported infections across weeks and origins. Sensitivity to prevalence changes or transmission rate (beta) implies that if infection rates increase, stricter or longer early controls may be needed; if they decrease, more relaxation is possible. This policy is robust to moderate parameter variations and leverages the SEIQRD model insights to optimize inbound traffic allocation."

States with lower infection prevalence (New Mexico) see more relaxed early restrictions to support mobility and economic activity. The cooperation logic balances epidemic control by shifting flows from early to later weeks, flattening imported infection peaks and allowing healthcare capacity to adapt. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection rates or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early-week reductions become more critical.

This strategy minimizes early imported infections that could seed outbreaks in Mississippi. By gradually relaxing restrictions, the policy balances epidemic control and mobility demands. The quantitative cooperation logic ensures total flow from each origin remains constant while reallocating weekly proportions to mitigate risk. Sensitivity to parameters like beta and prevalence means that if transmission rates or infection levels increase, stricter initial controls would yield greater benefits. Conversely, if prevalence declines, controls can be relaxed sooner. This dynamic allocation approach optimizes cumulative reduction in confirmed cases and deaths by controlling the timing of imported infections, leveraging knowledge of state-specific epidemiological profiles and mobility baselines.'
