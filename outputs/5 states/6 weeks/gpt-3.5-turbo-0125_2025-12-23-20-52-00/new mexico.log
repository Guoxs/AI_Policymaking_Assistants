      "restricted_origin": "texas",
      "notes": "Texas is prioritized for a temporary inbound travel restriction for the next two weeks. With a high average daily inflow of 117318.86, Texas poses a significant risk of importing infections into New Mexico. By reducing inbound flow from Texas by 50%, we aim to minimize the potential spread of the disease and protect the population of New Mexico."
      },
  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the decision to restrict inbound travel from Texas is based on the high average daily inflow and the corresponding risk of importing infections. By implementing this targeted restriction, we aim to reduce the overall burden of COVID-19 in New Mexico while considering the trade-offs between epidemic control and mobility disruption. It is crucial to continuously monitor the situation and adjust policies as needed to effectively manage the spread of the virus."
