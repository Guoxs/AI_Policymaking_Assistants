{
  "weekly_policy": {
      "restricted_origin": "texas",
      "notes": "Texas is selected for a temporary inbound travel restriction due to its high average daily inbound flow into Arizona, which can potentially lead to a significant number of imported infections. By reducing the inbound flow from Texas by 50% for the next two weeks, we aim to minimize the risk of additional cases and deaths in Arizona while balancing the trade-offs between epidemic control and mobility disruption."
      },
  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, Texas is prioritized for the travel restriction over the other origin states due to its high inbound flow and the potential impact on Arizona's epidemic situation. By implementing this targeted intervention, we aim to reduce the influx of infections into Arizona and control the spread of the disease within the state. It is crucial to carefully monitor the effectiveness of the restriction and adjust policies accordingly to protect the population of Arizona."
