{
  "weekly_policy": {
    "restricted_origin": "texas",
    "notes": "The state of Texas is prioritized for a temporary inbound travel restriction for the next two weeks. Texas has a high average daily inflow into Virginia and a relatively higher average number of infected individuals. By implementing a 50% reduction in inbound flow from Texas, we aim to minimize the potential importation of new cases into Virginia. This decision is made to mitigate the risk of increased transmission within Virginia and to protect the health and well-being of the population."
  },
  "global_guidance": "In making the decision to restrict inbound travel from Texas, we considered the balance between epidemic control and mobility disruption. While the restriction may impact travel and economic activities between the two states, the primary goal is to prevent the spread of the virus and reduce the burden on Virginia's healthcare system. By targeting a state with both high inbound flow and a significant number of infected individuals, we aim to proactively manage the risk of new infections in Virginia. This targeted approach allows for a more focused intervention while minimizing overall disruption to mobility and trade."
