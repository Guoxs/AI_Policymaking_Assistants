  "weekly_policy": {
    "restricted_origin": "texas",
    "notes": "Texas is prioritized for a temporary inbound travel restriction due to its high average daily inbound flow, significant number of infected individuals, and large population size. By reducing inbound flow from Texas by 50%, we aim to minimize the importation of new infections into Mississippi and control the spread of the disease within the state. This decision is based on the quantitative assessment of expected imported infections and the potential impact on the overall epidemic trajectory."
  },
  "global_guidance": "In the absence of a clear outlier state with exceptionally high risk indicators, the decision to restrict travel from Texas is a strategic trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption. By implementing this targeted intervention, we aim to strike a balance between minimizing the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi while mitigating the impact on interstate travel and economic activities. This approach aligns with the objective of reducing the overall burden on the healthcare system and protecting the health and well-being of the population."
