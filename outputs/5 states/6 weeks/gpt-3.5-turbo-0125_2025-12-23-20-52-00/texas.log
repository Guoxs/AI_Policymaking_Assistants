{
  "weekly_policy": {
      "restricted_origin": "new mexico",
      "notes": "New Mexico is selected for a temporary inbound travel restriction for the next 2 weeks. This decision is based on the high average daily inbound flow from New Mexico to Texas and the relatively higher average numbers of infected and confirmed cases in New Mexico compared to the other origin states. By reducing the inbound flow from New Mexico by 50%, we aim to minimize the potential importation of cases into Texas and control the spread of the disease within the state."
      },
  "global_guidance": "Implementing a temporary inbound travel restriction from New Mexico for the next 2 weeks is a targeted measure to reduce the risk of imported infections into Texas. This policy aims to strike a balance between epidemic control and mobility disruption by prioritizing public health outcomes while minimizing the impact on overall interstate travel. By closely monitoring the SEIQRD indicators and inbound flow data, Texas can effectively manage the spread of the disease and protect its population."
