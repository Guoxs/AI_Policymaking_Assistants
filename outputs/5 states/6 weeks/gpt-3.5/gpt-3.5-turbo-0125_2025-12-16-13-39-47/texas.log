Applying the import risk logic, a strict-first pattern with stronger restrictions in weeks 1 and 2 (0.30, 0.25) is optimal to reduce early seeding. Later weeks relax controls progressively. This pattern balances epidemic risk reduction with eventual mobility normalization, and fractions sum to 1 maintaining the total flow. Early stringent control is critical due to the higher infection prevalence."

The traffic allocation follows a strict-first pattern, gradually relaxing controls over the 6 weeks as prevalence stabilizes or improves. This balances epidemic control by limiting early seeding of infections while allowing mobility to resume later. The fractions sum exactly to 1.0000, ensuring the total inbound flow remains constant."

Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls should be amplified, especially for states with higher I and E values.
