The risk of importing infections is proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), which is moderate given the low I fraction (~0.00041). Given stable infection pressure, a slightly relaxed-first pattern is recommended to ease controls gradually while monitoring. Early weeks have stricter controls (ft=0.15) to reduce initial importation, then slightly relaxed later weeks to balance mobility needs. Trade-offs favor initial epidemic control while allowing later economic activity. The 6 fractions sum exactly to 1.000, ensuring total inbound flow consistency."
