Lower prevalence states with moderate inflow (Mississippi) also follow a strict-first pattern but with less aggressive early restrictions. The total inbound flow per state remains constant over 6 weeks, redistributing weekly proportions to concentrate stricter control early when imported infection risk is highest. This coordinated approach leverages temporal risk dynamics, reducing cumulative imported infections and deaths in Arizona.

The imported infections roughly scale with Flow*ft*(I/population). With a daily inflow of 2079.29, the risk is moderate. Since the infectious prevalence is somewhat steady, I recommend a strict-first pattern to suppress early imported infections, gradually relaxing controls later.
