    "notes": "Arizona has a moderately high exposed (E=110220) and confirmed (Q=159692) population relative to its size, indicating ongoing transmission risk. The infected count (I=7014) is moderate, contributing to potential imported infections. Imported infections scale roughly as Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)), so stricter controls earlier (lower fractions in weeks 4-6) help curb seeding new infections in Texas. The trend chosen is strict-first pattern, with higher inbound flow initially to allow some mobility but tapering to stricter controls to reduce risk as Texas tries to minimize cumulative cases. This balances mobility needs while prioritizing epidemic control. The fractions sum exactly to 1.00, ensuring flow conservation."
  },
  "mississippi": {
    "fractions": [0.22, 0.20, 0.18, 0.15, 0.13, 0.12],
    "notes": "Mississippi shows a relatively low infected count (I=2852) but a high exposed count (E=8110) relative to population, indicating potential for rising cases. The daily flow is moderate (50063.43). Risk of imported infections is proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), so we allocate more restrictive traffic control later weeks to minimize risk buildup, following a strict-first pattern. Early weeks have somewhat relaxed controls to maintain mobility but tighten progressively. This pattern helps reduce cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Texas. The fractions sum to 1.000 with 3 decimals, validating flow allocation."
  },
  "new mexico": {
    "fractions": [0.18, 0.18, 0.17, 0.16, 0.16, 0.15],
    "notes": "New Mexico presents a lower infected count (I=2211) but a significant exposed count (E=10497) and a large susceptible population. The high baseline flow (114898.1) means imported infections could significantly impact Texas. The fractions are allocated in a near-even pattern with slight front-loading to allow moderate traffic early, tapering slightly to stricter control later. This balanced approach mitigates risk without harsh disruptions to mobility. The imported infections estimate roughly scales with Flow*ft*(I/population). The sum of fractions equals 1.000, ensuring correct flow distribution."
  },
  "virginia": {
    "fractions": [0.30, 0.25, 0.18, 0.12, 0.10, 0.05],
    "notes": "Virginia has the highest infected count (I=22108) and exposed (E=93455) among origin states, indicating substantial transmission risk. The inbound flow is moderate (25113.43). Given the high infection pressure, a strict-first pattern is optimal: high inbound flow early weeks to accommodate necessary mobility but rapidly reduce flows later weeks to sharply cut infection importation. This dynamic allocation reduces cumulative infections and deaths in Texas. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000, respecting total flow constraints."
  },
  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocation across states uses a strict-first pattern for most origins with varying degrees of front-loading based on infection prevalence, balancing epidemic control and economic activity. States with higher infected and exposed populations such as Virginia and Arizona receive sharper reductions in later weeks to minimize infection importation. Lower risk states like New Mexico have more even distributions to sustain mobility. This cross-state coordinated approach lowers cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by distributing risk temporally and spatially, smoothing healthcare burden. Sensitivity to parameters like beta or infection prevalence implies that if transmission rates or infected proportions increase, stricter or longer controls would be needed. Conversely, lower prevalence or effective vaccination could allow more relaxed patterns. Overall, these allocations respect the total flow constraint while strategically timing mobility to mitigate epidemic impact in Texas."
