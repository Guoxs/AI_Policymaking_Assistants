    "notes": "Arizona has a moderately high exposed (E=110220) and infected (I=7014) population compared to its susceptible population (S=8406130), indicating a moderate infection pressure. The expected imported infected cases roughly follow imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population), so reducing flow in early weeks when infections are higher mitigates risk. Arizona's inflow is the highest among the smaller states to Virginia (5308.24 daily), so applying a strict-first pattern reduces early week risk and allows some relaxation later as infection pressure may drop. This balances epidemic control and mobility, minimizing initial seeding while preserving some flow to limit economic impact. The fractions sum to 1.0000, validating the allocation."

    "notes": "Mississippi shows relatively high infected (I=2852) and exposed (E=8110) proportions relative to its small susceptible population (S=329619), indicating a higher relative infection risk. The imported infected measure is proportional to Flow * ft * (I / population), so front-loading strict controls (strict-first) reduces early importation risk when local prevalence is higher. The daily inflow from Mississippi is moderate (3834.71), so early strict control is justified to protect Virginia from importation without overly restricting later mobility. This approach balances epidemic control with economic considerations. The fractions sum exactly to 1.0000."

The imported infected cases scale with Flow * ft * (I / population), and New Mexico's inflow is relatively low (2429.71 daily). A slightly front-loaded but more even distribution (mild strict-first) helps reduce initial seeding while allowing steady mobility in later weeks. This balances mobility and control, minimizing disruption while controlling risk. The fractions sum exactly to 1.0000."

    "notes": "Texas has a large population with moderate infected (I=13459) and exposed (E=8259) cases relative to its susceptible population (S=20877203). Although absolute infected is high, relative prevalence is moderate. Texas has the highest daily inflow to Virginia (20443.24), so reducing early week inflow (strict-first) is critical to limit imported infections, which scale as Flow * ft * (I / population). This approach balances epidemic risk and economic impact by gradually relaxing controls over 6 weeks. The fractions sum to exactly 1.0000."
  },
  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies across origin states prioritize early strict control (strict-first pattern) to reduce imported infections during periods of higher infection prevalence, which is critical for minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia. By adjusting weekly fractions so that early weeks have lower traffic (ft) from higher-risk states, we reduce initial seeding of the virus. Later weeks have relaxed controls to balance mobility needs and economic considerations. The total inbound flow over 6 weeks remains constant for each state, preserving long-term mobility baselines while optimizing timing to reduce risk. Cross-state coordination distributes control efforts to states with higher infection burden while not overly restricting those with lower risk, achieving an effective risk balancing strategy. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increase, stricter or longer front-loaded controls would be necessary to maintain risk reduction. Conversely, lower prevalence or beta could allow more relaxed policies. Overall, this dynamic, front-loaded control strategy efficiently minimizes infections and deaths in Virginia by targeting temporal and spatial infection pressure patterns while maintaining baseline mobility totals."
