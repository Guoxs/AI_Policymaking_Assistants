The expected imported infections roughly scale with flow*f_t*(I/S), suggesting weeks with higher fractions increase infection risk. Arizona's infection prevalence is moderate but not alarmingly high. We choose a strict-first pattern, allocating lower fractions to early weeks (0.25,0.20) to reduce initial importation when local incidence is still significant, then relaxing control gradually to balance mobility needs. This pattern mitigates early seeding of new cases in New Mexico while allowing some economic mobility later.

To minimize importation risk, we apply a strict-first pattern, heavily restricting inbound flow early (0.10, 0.12), then gradually relaxing controls to allow essential mobility later as local New Mexico prevalence may decline or stabilize. This front-loading of restrictions reduces early seeding of infections into New Mexico. The fractions sum exactly to 1.00, preserving total flow.

We adopt a strict-first pattern with more restriction during the first weeks (0.20, 0.18) to reduce early import risk, then ease controls slightly while maintaining caution due to Texas's large mobility contribution.

We choose a relaxed-first pattern, starting with stricter control (0.10, 0.10) and gradually relaxing to higher fractions later (up to 0.24), reflecting lower urgency for immediate restrictions and allowing gradual mobility restoration. This balances risk and economic activity, especially given the smaller flow. The fractions sum precisely to 1.00."

Later weeks see gradual relaxation to support mobility and economic activity while local control measures and immunity reduce susceptibility. Balancing flow fractions so each origin state's total 6-week inbound flow remains constant ensures mobility needs are met without increasing total importation risk. This coordinated approach mitigates cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by temporally staggering inbound traffic to avoid overwhelming local containment. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls and longer duration would be needed, while lower prevalence allows faster relaxation.

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative infections and deaths in New Mexico, traffic control policies collectively prioritize early strict inbound traffic reductions from higher-risk states (Arizona, Mississippi, Virginia) with higher exposed and infected populations. Texas, due to its very large inflow and population, is managed with a more even distribution to smooth risk without overly restricting mobility. This cross-state coordination balances epidemic importation risks by lowering early-week traffic fractions where exposure and infection prevalence is highest, thus flattening the imported infection curve. Quantitatively, imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing ft in early weeks from states with higher I/population effectively lowers imported seedings. Sensitivity analysis suggests if beta (transmission rate) or prevalence varies, early strict controls become even more critical to prevent outbreak amplification. Conversely, if prevalence falls, relaxing controls earlier becomes safer. The recommended policies provide a pragmatic trade-off between epidemic control and socioeconomic mobility considering New Mexico¡¯s current epidemic status and inflow patterns."

    "notes": "Arizona has a high number of exposed (E=110220) and infected (I=7014) individuals relative to its population, indicating significant risk of imported infections. The expected imported infected cases can be roughly estimated by Flow * ft * (I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)). Given the high infection pressure, a strict-first allocation pattern is chosen to front-load stricter controls in the early weeks when prevalence is higher, gradually relaxing controls as infection risk diminishes. This balances epidemic control by reducing early importation risk while allowing some mobility later. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.35+0.25+0.15+0.10+0.10+0.05=1)."

Imported infections scale with Flow * ft * (I/population). A strict-first pattern is also chosen here to reduce early importation risk, tapering controls over time.

Imported infected cases scale as Flow * ft * (I/population), and given the large flow (133909.67 daily), controlling inbound traffic is critical. A strict-first pattern is used to strongly restrict traffic in early weeks to reduce imported infections, relaxing later as risk hopefully decreases. This approach balances mobility with epidemic control. Fractions sum to 1 exactly."

Though daily inflow is low (1276.71), the high infection prevalence justifies cautious traffic control. A strict-first pattern is chosen, with more moderate early restrictions compared to Texas and Arizona due to lower flow, gradually relaxing. Fractions sum exactly to 1."
  },
  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies collectively prioritize early-week strict controls across all origin states, reflecting higher infection prevalence and importation risk early in the 6-week period. This front-loaded control reduces the cumulative imported infections and deaths in New Mexico by minimizing high-risk importations when prevalence is elevated. Later weeks have progressively relaxed controls to balance economic and social mobility needs. Quantitative cooperation logic allocates stricter controls where both infection prevalence and inbound flow are highest (Texas and Arizona), while states with lower flows or prevalence have relatively moderate restrictions. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter controls should be extended longer or intensified. Conversely, if beta or prevalence decreases, controls can relax earlier. This approach balances epidemic control and mobility, aiming to minimize new infections and deaths in New Mexico over the next 6 weeks."
