    "notes": "Texas has a high infected count (I=14576) and exposed (E=8929) over a large population (~23 million), representing a significant risk of importing infections. The formula Flow*ft*(I/pop) guides us to slightly reduce early week fractions to limit initial importation pressure, but not severely to avoid excessive economic disruption given the large volume. A mild strict-first pattern is applied with relatively even fractions to balance risk reduction and mobility. Sum of fractions is exactly 1, ensuring flow conservation."

Using Flow*ft*(I/pop), early week strict control reduces initial imported infectious pressure, with gradual relaxation later. The strict-first pattern helps delay seeding infections in Arizona. This approach balances epidemic control with maintaining some mobility later. The fractions sum to 1 exactly."

  "global_guidance": "Across all origin states, applying a strict-first pattern prioritizes reducing early week importation of infectious individuals into Arizona, which is critical to slowing epidemic growth given the SEIQRD dynamics and beta transmission rate. By controlling early influxes from states with higher infected and exposed populations, the cumulative infections and deaths in Arizona can be minimized. The total flow is preserved exactly (sum of fractions = 1 for each state), ensuring no economic shock from sudden volume drops, but temporal redistribution achieves risk balancing. Sensitivity analysis shows that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls would yield more benefit. Conversely, if these parameters drop, controls could be relaxed further. The chosen gradual relaxation over 6 weeks offers flexibility to respond to dynamic epidemic trends while maintaining essential mobility and economic activity."

    "notes": "Mississippi has a relatively small infected population (I=2852) compared to its total population (~6.6M). The imported infected estimate scales as Flow*ft*(I/population). We choose a slight strict-first pattern, with lower fractions in early weeks (0.20,0.18,0.17) gradually stabilizing, to reduce initial imported infections when Arizona's exposed population is still significant. This balances epidemic control by limiting early importation while allowing some mobility later. The fractions sum exactly to 1.00. Lower initial inflow reduces early seeding of cases, which is critical given Mississippi's moderate infection prevalence."

Given this moderate risk, we apply a strict-first pattern to reduce early week inflow (0.22,0.20,0.18) and delay higher traffic to later weeks when Arizona's epidemic can be better managed. This pattern mitigates initial seeding risk and helps balance the trade-off between controlling spread and maintaining mobility. The fractions sum to exactly 1.00."

We adopt a strict-first pattern with strong early restrictions (0.10,0.10) to sharply reduce initial imported infections, then gradually relax controls in later weeks as Arizona's epidemic stabilizes. This approach balances mobility needs with epidemic control, preventing early seeding from a high-risk origin state. Fractions sum to 1.00 precisely."

Import risk is considerable, so we apply a mild strict-first pattern, with slightly reduced early weeks (0.18,0.16,0.16) and stable later weeks. This approach limits early imported cases while maintaining reasonable mobility. Trade-offs favor early caution given Virginia's infection prevalence, while ensuring traffic volume sums to 1.00 exactly."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound allocations collectively prioritize reducing imported infections during the early weeks when Arizona's exposed and infected populations are vulnerable to seeding new chains of transmission. By front-loading stricter controls (lower fractions) on origin states with higher infected prevalence (Texas, Virginia) and moderately strict on medium-risk states (Mississippi, New Mexico), the policy minimizes cumulative infections and deaths in Arizona. Quantitatively, expected imported infections approximate Flow*ft*(I/population), so lowering ft early reduces initial imported cases substantially. Across weeks, gradually relaxing controls balances epidemic control with mobility needs. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or beta increases, stricter early controls yield larger benefits, while lower prevalence allows more even distributions. This coordinated cross-state approach reduces risk spillovers and supports Arizonas epidemic management over the 6-week horizon."
