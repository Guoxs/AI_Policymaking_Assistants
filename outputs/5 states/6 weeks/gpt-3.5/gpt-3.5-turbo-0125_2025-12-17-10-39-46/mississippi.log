By allocating lower fractions early and increasing them later, the policy balances epidemic control and mobility needs. The quantitative logic hinges on the proportion of infected individuals in each origin state and the inbound flow, as imported infections scale with Flow * ft * (I / population). This cooperation ensures that peak imported infection risk is mitigated across all states simultaneously, preventing overwhelming Mississippi's healthcare system. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence drops or beta decreases, the policy can be relaxed sooner. Overall, this coordinated temporal distribution minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi while maintaining total inbound flow constant."

    "notes": "Arizona's E and I numbers are moderate relative to its large population, with E=110,220 and I=7,014. The imported infected cases roughly scale with Flow * ft * (I / population). Given the relatively lower infection pressure compared to other states, a 'strict-first' pattern is chosen to front-load stricter controls in early weeks to prevent seeding new infections in Mississippi, then relax over time as the imported risk reduces. This pattern balances early epidemic control while allowing some mobility later. The fractions sum to exactly 1, ensuring the total inbound flow remains constant."

    "notes": "New Mexico has relatively low infection prevalence (I=2,211) and E=10,497 with a smaller population than Arizona, indicating lower importation risk. Using the formula Flow * ft * (I / population), peak risk is early, so stricter control initially (strict-first) reduces early seeding. The fractions progressively relax as risk diminishes. Trade-offs favor epidemic control early while preserving mobility later. The fractions sum to 1 exactly."

The imported infected risk is high: Flow * ft * (I/population). A 'strict-first' pattern is chosen to reduce early week flows to minimize initial infected importation, progressively relaxing as incidence might drop or control effects accumulate. This approach balances high mobility demand with epidemic control. Fractions sum to 1 exactly."

Applying Flow * ft * (I/population), early weeks represent the greatest risk. Hence, a strict-first pattern with strong early restrictions is optimal to prevent seeding Mississippi. Mobility is progressively relaxed as risk reduces. This pattern balances epidemic control and necessary mobility. Fractions sum to exactly 1."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended allocations apply a strict-first traffic control pattern for all origin states, prioritizing stronger inbound flow restrictions in the initial weeks when imported infection risk is highest. This approach minimizes early seeding of new cases and deaths in Mississippi by reducing importation when prevalence in origin states is high. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections scale with Flow * ft * (I/population), so front-loading restrictions reduces the cumulative imported infectious pressure. Balancing restrictions across states considers their relative prevalence and flow magnitudes, assigning stricter controls to states with higher infection burdens (Virginia, Texas) to reduce their disproportionate risk. Over time, as local and external infections decrease, controls relax to restore mobility gradually. Sensitivity to prevalence changes or transmission rate (beta) suggests that if prevalence or beta increases, stricter or longer early controls may be needed, while lower values allow more relaxed policies. This cooperative, time-phased approach effectively minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi while preserving mobility."
