Expected imported infected roughly scales as Flow*ft*(I/population), so with a relatively large flow (1471.52 daily), front-loading restrictions reduces early importation risk. The pattern chosen is strict-first, implementing stricter controls in the initial four weeks (0.15 fractions) to minimize early seeding in Mississippi, then gradually relaxing in weeks 5 and 6 (0.2 fractions each) as local control in Mississippi stabilizes. This balances epidemic control by delaying imported infections while allowing some mobility later. The fractions sum to exactly 1.0000, validating the allocation."
