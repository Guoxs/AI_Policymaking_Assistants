The expected imported infections roughly scale as Flow*ft*(I/population), suggesting that controlling early weeks with higher inbound flow risks seeding more infections. We apply a strict-first pattern with decreasing fractions over time, prioritizing stricter controls early to reduce importation when Arizona's susceptible population is still high. Trade-offs involve balancing economic and social mobility with epidemic control; stricter early restrictions may reduce immediate importation but can strain travel needs.

Given Texas's high flow (51312.76 daily), imported infections can be substantial if uncontrolled. However, given the long-term nature of epidemic control and economic importance, we adopt a relaxed-first pattern initially to accommodate mobility needs, then maintain moderate controls mid to late weeks to avoid resurgence. This allows some early travel with monitoring and stepped-up restrictions later to control potential spikes. Trade-offs include balancing epidemic control with economic ties.

The inbound flow is moderate (6712.05), so imported infections risk is significant but manageable. We select a strict-first pattern reducing fractions over weeks to minimize early importation when Arizona's susceptible pool is largest, then relax gradually. This approach balances epidemic risk and mobility, aiming to prevent early seeding of infections. The fractions sum perfectly to 1.000, confirming valid allocation."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively minimize Arizona's cumulative infections and deaths, inbound traffic allocations emphasize stricter controls in early weeks for higher-risk origin states (Mississippi, Virginia) and moderate controls for lower-risk states (New Mexico). Texas receives a relaxed-first pattern to balance its large flow and economic ties but maintains controls later to mitigate infection spikes. This coordinated approach reduces imported infection pressure when Arizona's susceptible population is high, thereby lowering secondary transmission risks. Quantitatively, the sum of weekly fractions equals 1 for each state, preserving total inbound flow while redistributing temporal risk. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter or prolonged controls may be needed, especially for high-prevalence states. Conversely, if prevalence drops, allocations can relax earlier. This dynamic balancing leverages temporal and cross-state cooperation to optimize epidemic control and mobility trade-offs."
