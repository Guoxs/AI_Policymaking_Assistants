    "notes": "Risk interpretation: arizona's high infected population and inbound flow pose a significant risk to mississippi. Expected imported infections ~ Flow*0.262*(I/population). We choose a relaxed-first pattern to allocate traffic, as arizona's inbound flow is relatively high. This pattern aims to minimize the spread of infections while allowing for some relaxation of traffic controls. Trade-offs: stricter control means reduced inbound flow, which could lead to less imported infections, but also reduces mobility and cooperation. Validation: the fractions sum to 1."
