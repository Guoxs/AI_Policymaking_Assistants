    "notes": "Arizona has a high risk of imported infections due to its high beta value and large population. The fractions are allocated to minimize the expected imported infections, with a stricter control in the first two weeks and a more relaxed control in the last four weeks. This is justified by the observation that the infection pressure is higher in the first weeks, and a more relaxed control in the last weeks can help reduce the accumulated stress in the system. The trade-off is between epidemic control and mobility, and a balance is struck to minimize the expected imported infections and deaths."
