We then gradually reduce the ft for the remaining weeks.

    "notes": "Based on the risk interpretation, the SEIQRD values indicate a relatively low risk of infection in Mississippi. As a result, a moderate allocation of inbound traffic is recommended. The even pattern is chosen for traffic allocation, as it provides a balance between epidemic control and mobility. The risk of imported infections is expected to be low, and the allocation ensures a steady flow of people into Arizona. The trade-off is between controlling the spread of the disease and maintaining mobility, with a focus on minimizing the impact on Arizona's population. The validation ensures that the 6 fractions sum to 1."
