The inbound flow pattern follows a strict-first approach, with the first three weeks having the highest fractions. This is because the initial stages of the epidemic are more critical in terms of controlling the spread. The fractions are adjusted to maintain a total inflow of 3945.74, which is the ground truth daily average for the next 42 days. The reasoning is that a strict approach in the initial stages will help reduce the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia.

    "notes": "Arizona's high SEIRD values (I/Q) and high inbound flow indicate a higher risk of imported infections. I allocate 16.4% to week 1, 23.1% to week 2, and 21.2% to week 3, as these weeks have the highest risk. For weeks 4-6, I allocate 11.5%, 13.8%, and 14% respectively, as the risk drops. This pattern allows for a balance between controlling the outbreak and maintaining mobility.\n\nThe total inbound flow remains constant, and the fractions sum to 1. This allocation should reduce the expected imported infections and deaths in Virginia."
