    "notes": "Arizona's high beta (0.499) and low gamma (0.099) suggest high infection pressure. To minimize imported infections, we allocate more flow to weeks 1-3 and 5, with stricter controls (lower ft) to reduce the risk of imported infections. The risk interpretation is based on SEIQRD values: higher I and Q imply higher risk. The quantitative logic is: imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population). We choose a strict-first pattern to describe the traffic allocation, as it aligns with the infection pressure trends. Trade-offs between epidemic control and mobility are crucial, as stricter controls may lead to economic losses. Validation: f1+f2+f3+f4+f5+f6=1.000."
