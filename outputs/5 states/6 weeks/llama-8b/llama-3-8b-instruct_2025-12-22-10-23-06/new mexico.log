The risk interpretation is based on the SEIQRD values, where the average daily inbound flow is expected to import infected individuals. The quantitative logic is: imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population). The pattern chosen is relaxed-first, as the high inbound flow from Arizona requires a more relaxed control in the first few weeks, allowing for a gradual decrease in the flow as the risk decreases. The trade-off is between epidemic control and mobility, where a more relaxed control in the first few weeks allows for a more significant reduction in imported infections.

To mitigate this, we recommend a stricter traffic control policy, with a higher proportion of flow in the first two weeks (ft=0.272 and ft=0.241) to reduce the influx of infected individuals. As the epidemic slows down, we gradually relax the control in the subsequent weeks. The overall inbound flow is adjusted to maintain the ground truth daily average."
