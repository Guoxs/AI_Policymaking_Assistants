    "fractions": [0.214, 0.236, 0.211, 0.233, 0.199, 0.207],
    "notes": "Arizona has a high proportion of susceptible individuals, which increases the risk of imported infections. The risk interpretation is that imported infections ~ Flow*ft*(I/population). Quantitative logic suggests that imported infections are directly proportional to inbound flow and infected individuals. I choose the pattern of relaxed-first traffic allocation, as the risk of imported infections decreases rapidly in the first few weeks. Trade-offs between epidemic control and mobility suggest that stricter control in the first few weeks can reduce the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Texas. Validation: The 6 fractions sum to 1."
