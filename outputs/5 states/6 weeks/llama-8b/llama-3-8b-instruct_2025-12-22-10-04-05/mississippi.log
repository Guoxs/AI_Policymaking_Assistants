    "notes": "Arizona's high I and Q values indicate a significant risk of imported infections. We allocate 23.45% of the flow in the first week, gradually decreasing to 15.41% in the sixth week. This pattern is chosen based on the expected decline of I and Q values over time. The risk interpretation is that high I values in Arizona pose a significant threat to Mississippi, and the quantitative logic is that imported infections will be approximately Flow*ft*(I/population). We choose a strict-first pattern to prioritize epidemic control, as the trade-off between mobility and control is skewed towards reducing imported infections. Validation is ensured by the fractions summing to 1."
