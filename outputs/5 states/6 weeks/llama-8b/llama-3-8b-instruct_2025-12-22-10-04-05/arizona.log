    "notes": "Mississippi's high past 21-day I and Q rates, along with high inbound flow, suggest a higher risk of imported infections. To mitigate this risk, we recommend a stricter control pattern, allocating more flow to the first weeks and decreasing it gradually. This pattern aims to reduce imported infections and deaths.
