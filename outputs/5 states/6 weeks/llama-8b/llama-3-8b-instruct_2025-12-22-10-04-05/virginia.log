Pattern: relaxed-first, as initial relaxation of traffic control could lead to a more rapid decline in imported infections. Trade-offs: stricter traffic control early on would reduce imported infections but may have a less significant impact later on. Validation: fractions sum to 1. Three- to four-decimal precision maintained."
