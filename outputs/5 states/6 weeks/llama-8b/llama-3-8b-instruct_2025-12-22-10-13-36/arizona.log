    "notes": "Mississippi has a relatively low number of infected individuals (4535), but a moderate inflow into Arizona. To mitigate the risk, we recommend a strict-first pattern, allocating more flow to the first few weeks. The even pattern is not suitable as it would not effectively reduce the peak of infections. The risk interpretation suggests that imported infections will be around 1849.52*0.111577643000077*(4535/8467673) ~ 10.85 imported infections per day. To control this, we should aim to reduce the inflow to a minimum. The trade-off is between epidemic control and mobility, and we prioritize the former in this case."
