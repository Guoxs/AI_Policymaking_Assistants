    "notes": "For Arizona, the risk interpretation suggests a moderate to high risk of imported infections due to its relatively high past 21-day I and Q values. The quantitative logic suggests that imported infections will be around Flow*ft*(I/population). With an average past 21-day I of 3796 and population of 8921988, the expected imported infections are approximately 0.43 Flow*ft. 

We choose the even pattern for traffic allocation, where the fraction for the first week is equal to the ground truth daily average inflow divided by the total ground truth inflow, and the fraction for each subsequent week is the remaining fraction divided by the number of weeks. 

The trade-off is between epidemic control and mobility. A stricter traffic control (lower ft) will result in fewer expected imported infections, but may also increase the risk of economic disruption. A relaxed traffic control (higher ft) may allow for more mobility, but may also lead to a higher number of expected imported infections.
