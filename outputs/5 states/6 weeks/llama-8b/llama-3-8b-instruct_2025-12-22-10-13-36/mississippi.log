The fraction allocation is designed to maximize the reduction of imported infections and deaths. We chose a relaxed-first pattern as the inbound flow is relatively low. Even though Virginia has a higher mobility baseline, its inbound flow is significantly lower than the other states. We prioritized Texas and New Mexico due to their higher mobility baselines and past 21-day inflow averages. The risk interpretation suggests that the inbound flow from Arizona will lead to approximately 12.5 imported infections per day. The quantitative logic is ft*(I/population)*flow. The trade-off between epidemic control and mobility is that stricter control can reduce imported infections but may also disrupt the economy. The validation ensures that the 6 fractions sum to 1."
