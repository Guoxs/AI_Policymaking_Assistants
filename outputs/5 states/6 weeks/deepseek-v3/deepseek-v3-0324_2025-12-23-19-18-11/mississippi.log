Cross-state reasoning involves balancing infection pressure (I, Q) and inflow magnitude. Quantitative cooperation logic ensures high-risk states have lower initial fractions, reducing early epidemic spread. Sensitivity reasoning: if prevalence (I, Q) increases, fractions should be adjusted to be stricter; if beta (transmission rate) increases, fractions should also be stricter. The approach balances epidemic control and mobility needs across all origin states.'
