    "notes": "Arizona has a high exposed (E) and infected (I) population, indicating significant infection pressure. The fractions are designed to start strict (low ft) and gradually relax, allowing time to monitor the impact of reduced inflow on Texas's infection rates. The initial low fractions (0.05, 0.1) minimize immediate risk, while the later fractions (0.25, 0.25) balance economic and social needs.

The fractions are balanced to avoid extreme restrictions, starting at 0.15 and peaking at 0.2 for three weeks before declining. This approach minimizes disruption while controlling imported infections. The sum of fractions is 1, ensuring the ground truth inflow is met."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocations are designed to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Texas by strategically controlling flow from high-risk states.

This approach balances epidemic control with mobility needs, adapting to varying infection pressures across states. If prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter controls (lower ft) may be needed, especially in early weeks. Conversely, if conditions improve, later fractions could be relaxed further."
