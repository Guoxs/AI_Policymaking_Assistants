Low-risk states (New Mexico/Virginia) maintain steady flows. Cross-state coordination minimizes cumulative imported infections by ¡Ö34% in critical early weeks. Quantitative logic: Risk-score = (I_origin/pop_origin)*Flow guides temporal shifts; Arizona's current Reff (¡Ö4.4) amplifies early import risks. Sensitivity: If origin prevalence rises, delayed allocations become more effective; if Arizona's transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls gain importance.
