Mississippi (prevalence 1.84percent) receives aggressive quadratic allocation to prevent early transmission chains. Lower-risk states (prevalence <0.1percent) use linear shifts. This reduces in-period secondary cases by limiting transmission development time: early imports have more weeks to generate cases before period end. Balancing relies on New Mexico's subcritical Reff (0.115) ¨C each delayed infection avoids ¡Ö0.114 expected secondary cases within 6 weeks. Sensitivity: if origin prevalence decreases, delaying gains effectiveness; if New Mexico's Reff rises above 1, early restrictions become critical to prevent outbreaks. Coordinated delay across states optimizes epidemic impact without reducing total mobility."
