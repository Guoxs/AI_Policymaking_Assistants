Cross-state coordination balances Texas's large flow (30k/day) with its high prevalence, while lower-flow states (Virginia, New Mexico) face moderate restrictions. Sensitivity: if beta increases, stricter early controls (lower f1-f3) would be needed. Quantitative cooperation logic weights each state's risk by (I+E)/population * Flow, with Texas contributing ~60percent of total imported risk. The phased relaxation aligns with Mississippi's recovery trajectory (high R=92697), allowing gradual reintegration."
