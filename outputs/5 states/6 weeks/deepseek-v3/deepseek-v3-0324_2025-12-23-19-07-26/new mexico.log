Lower-risk states (Virginia, Texas) have more balanced allocations. Cross-state, this minimizes cumulative imported infections by targeting the highest I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D) ratios first. Quantitative logic: total risk is sum over states of Flow*ft*(I_origin/pop_origin)*beta_NM. Sensitivity: if beta_NM increases, stricter controls are needed; if origin prevalence drops, allocations can be relaxed. Cooperation logic: high-risk states accept stricter early controls to protect NM's vulnerable population."
