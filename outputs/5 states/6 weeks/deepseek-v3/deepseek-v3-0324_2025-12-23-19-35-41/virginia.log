  "global_guidance": "The inbound allocations are designed to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia by adjusting weekly traffic flows based on origin state risk. High-risk states (e.g., Arizona, Mississippi) have stricter initial controls to reduce early imported infections, while lower-risk states (e.g., New Mexico) allow more initial mobility. The fractions ensure total inbound flow remains constant over 6 weeks. Cross-state cooperation is achieved by aligning controls with infection pressure trends. Sensitivity analysis shows that if prevalence increases, stricter controls may be needed, while lower prevalence could allow more relaxed allocations. The approach balances epidemic control and mobility needs across all origin states."
