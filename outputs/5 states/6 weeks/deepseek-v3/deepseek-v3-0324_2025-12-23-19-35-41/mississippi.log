    "notes": "Arizona has high infected (I=4098) and exposed (E=62906) populations, indicating significant infection risk. The fractions are designed to start with stricter controls (low f1-f3) to minimize initial imported infections, then gradually relax (higher f4-f6) as monitoring data becomes available. The allocation follows a strict-first pattern to reduce early transmission spikes. Trade-offs balance mobility needs with epidemic control, ensuring total flow remains constant."

The fractions start moderately strict (f1=0.1) to limit early imports, then stabilize (f2-f5) to allow controlled mobility.

The fractions are highly strict initially (f1=0.02) to prevent surge, then gradually increase (f6=0.33) as controls mitigate risk. The strict-first pattern prioritizes early suppression.

The fractions maintain consistent mid-level controls (f1-f4=0.15-0.2) to balance risk and mobility, then taper (f5-f6) as cumulative flow is met. The even pattern ensures steady risk management without abrupt changes."

Cross-state cooperation is achieved by scaling fractions inversely with origin-state prevalence (I/population). Sensitivity analysis suggests tighter controls if beta or prevalence increases, but current fractions optimize for observed parameters. The 6-week horizon allows adaptive adjustments based on real-time data."
