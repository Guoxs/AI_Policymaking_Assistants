States with higher infection prevalence and moderate to high flow (Arizona, Virginia, Mississippi) have stricter controls front-loaded in early weeks to curb seeding of new cases. Texas, with low infection prevalence but very high flow, uses a relaxed-first pattern to gradually increase flow after initial restrictions, leveraging lower infection pressure. This cross-state allocation reduces early imported infections, lowers transmission risk, and prevents overwhelming local healthcare. Sensitivity to parameters such as beta and prevalence indicates that if infection rates rise, stricter early control should be intensified. Conversely, if beta decreases or prevalence diminishes, relaxation could be faster. The total daily inbound flow remains constant per state, but temporal distribution optimizes epidemic control while balancing economic and social impacts.'

Later weeks see gradual relaxation to support mobility and economic activity while local control measures and immunity reduce susceptibility. Balancing flow fractions so each origin state's total 6-week inbound flow remains constant ensures mobility needs are met without increasing total importation risk. This coordinated approach mitigates cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by temporally staggering inbound traffic to avoid overwhelming local containment. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls and longer duration would be needed, while lower prevalence allows faster relaxation. This policy framework is adaptable to evolving epidemiological conditions and can integrate real-time surveillance data for dynamic adjustment."

States with higher infection rates but lower flows (e.g., Mississippi) receive moderately balanced allocations, reflecting their high per traveler risk but lower traffic volume. Virginia's moderate infection and low flow justify an even allocation. This cross-state strategy reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths by smoothing risk over time and states, preventing epidemic spikes in New Mexico. Quantitatively, imported infections scale as Flow*ft*(I/pop), so controlling ft early for high-risk, high-flow states yields maximal impact. Sensitivity analysis shows that increased beta or prevalence would further favor stricter early controls, while decreases allow more relaxation. Overall, balancing epidemic control and mobility ensures sustainable policy and effective disease suppression."

This front-loading of restrictions takes advantage of the incubation period and delays in case confirmation to prevent seeding new outbreaks. Balancing flow over six weeks while keeping total inbound traffic constant allows economic and social activity to continue with reduced epidemic risk. The strategy assumes infection pressure from origin states remains roughly stable; if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter or longer controls may be needed. Conversely, if prevalence declines, controls could be relaxed sooner. Coordination across states ensures no single state disproportionately increases risk at any time, smoothing importation risk and preventing outbreaks. Sensitivity analysis indicates that shifts in prevalence or mobility baselines would necessitate recalibration of weekly fractions to maintain optimal risk balance.'

This cross-state approach leverages temporal balancing of inbound flows to flatten the curve of imported infections, reducing cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico. Quantitatively, the strategy follows the logic that imported infections ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing early ft for high I states reduces new infections effectively. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls would be warranted, especially for high-flow states. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed early controls could be feasible. Overall, balancing epidemic control with mobility demands careful week-by-week modulation of inbound traffic fractions to optimize health outcomes while minimizing economic impact.'

States with higher infected counts and inflow volumes, such as Texas and Arizona, have more pronounced front-loaded restrictions, reflecting their greater epidemic pressure. Lower-risk states like Mississippi have milder early restrictions. This balanced approach reduces cumulative infections and deaths by minimizing early importation while gradually restoring mobility. Quantitatively, allocating lower fractions (ft) in early weeks effectively reduces imported infections as these scale with Flow * ft * (I/population). Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence declines, controls can relax sooner. Coordinated control timing across states ensures that peak importations do not coincide, reducing overall risk to New Mexico.'
