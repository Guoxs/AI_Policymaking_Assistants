States with moderate infections (Arizona, New Mexico) have more balanced allocations to maintain some mobility while managing risk. This coordinated strategy balances epidemic control and economic activity by shifting flow to later weeks, when Texas's local control and immunity may better handle imported cases. Quantitatively, imported infected cases scale with Flow * ft * (I/population); thus, reducing ft in weeks with higher risk effectively lowers imported infections. Sensitivity to parameters like beta and infection prevalence is high; if beta increases or local prevalence changes, stricter early controls might be needed. This policy is adaptive and can be tuned with updated epidemiological data to optimize outcomes."

States with higher infection prevalence (mississippi, virginia) receive stricter early-week controls, while low-prevalence states (new mexico) have more evenly distributed flow. This cross-state balancing reduces cumulative infection pressure on Texas by staggering inbound traffic, preventing simultaneous importation peaks. Quantitatively, imported infections approximate Flow*ft*(I/pop), so adjusting ft dynamically controls risk without reducing total flow. Sensitivity to prevalence changes or transmission rate beta would adjust strictness: higher beta or prevalence would necessitate stricter early controls. This cooperative, time-phased pattern optimizes epidemic control without severe mobility disruption.'

New Mexico, with very low infection pressure, maintains relatively steady inbound flow to balance economic and social needs. By redistributing the fixed total inbound flows across weeks with a strict-first pattern for higher-risk origins, we minimize cumulative infections and deaths in Texas. This approach leverages cross-state risk balancing and temporal control to flatten importation peaks. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if transmission rate beta increases or infected prevalence shifts, the strict-first pattern remains effective by frontloading restrictions early, but timing and fraction values can be adjusted accordingly. Overall, these allocations optimize epidemic control while respecting total mobility baselines."

The strict-first pattern for higher-risk states like Mississippi and Arizona limits early high-risk inflows, while New Mexico's relaxed-first pattern leverages its low infection prevalence to maintain mobility. This cooperation reduces the aggregate effective transmission into Texas. Sensitivity to beta and infection prevalence means that if transmission rates or infection counts rise, earlier and stricter controls would be warranted. Conversely, if values decrease, controls can be relaxed. This dynamic allocation optimizes cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by smoothing imported infection pressure over time and origin states."

By concentrating restrictions in early weeks, we minimize cumulative imported infections and deaths in Texas, allowing epidemic containment before easing mobility. This cross-state coordination balances infection pressures and flow volumes to optimize public health outcomes. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, front-loading even stricter early control would further reduce risk; conversely, lower prevalence may allow more balanced flow distributions. This adaptive, risk-based strategy ensures efficient resource use and epidemic mitigation.'

The strict-first patterns for Arizona, Mississippi, and Virginia address their infection pressures by suppressing early importation. New Mexico's near-even pattern reflects its high exposed population and uncertain infection dynamics, balancing control and mobility. These patterns distribute traffic to flatten imported infection peaks, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths. Quantitatively, since imported infections are proportional to Flow * ft * (I/population), reducing ft in early weeks significantly lowers early seeding risks. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early restrictions become more critical. Conversely, lower prevalence permits more balanced flows. This cooperative approach across states ensures Texas receives controlled, timed inflows reducing outbreak risks while sustaining necessary mobility."
