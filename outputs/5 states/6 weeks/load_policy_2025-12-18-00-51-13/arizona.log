States like New Mexico and Mississippi with higher infected ratios and significant inflows face stricter early-week controls ('strict-first' pattern) to prevent seeding new outbreaks that amplify Arizona's epidemic. Texas, with low infected prevalence and high population, uses an 'even' pattern to maintain mobility with manageable risk. Virginia, with moderate prevalence and inflow, also follows 'strict-first' to reduce early risk. This coordinated approach balances epidemic control and economic impact by lowering traffic when importation risk is highest and relaxing controls as local epidemic conditions improve. Quantitatively, traffic fractions ft are tuned so that sum over 6 weeks equals 1, preserving total inflow volume but reshaping weekly distribution to minimize net imported infections (~ Flow * ft * (I/pop)) and subsequent deaths. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or beta increase, stricter early controls would yield greater benefits, while if prevalence drops, controls can be eased earlier. Cross-state cooperation ensures no week or state disproportionately contributes to risk spikes. This policy leverages temporal modulation of traffic to optimize Arizona's epidemic trajectory."

Balancing weekly fractions ensures total inbound flows remain constant, preserving economic activity. This coordinated approach reduces cumulative infections and deaths in Arizona by minimizing early seeding and smoothing mobility. Sensitivity to parameters like beta means if transmission rates rise, stricter early controls would become more critical. Conversely, lower beta or prevalence allows more relaxed schedules.

States with lower infection risk (New Mexico) receive more relaxed early restrictions, shifting flow to later weeks to better distribute risk. Virginia's moderate risk justifies an even allocation. This cross-state pattern reduces cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by balancing imported infection risk over time, minimizing peak infection pressure on Arizona's health system. Quantitatively, imported infected cases scale with Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing ft in high-risk early weeks lowers imported infections substantially. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more critical. Conversely, if prevalence drops, controls can be relaxed sooner. This adaptive, state-specific, and temporally dynamic approach optimally balances epidemic control and economic mobility, minimizing total infections and deaths in Arizona over the next 6 weeks."

States with lower prevalence and/or higher inflow (New Mexico) have relaxed early controls to preserve mobility and economic activity. The strategy balances epidemic control by prioritizing strict early restrictions on states with high I/population ratios and large inflow, while allowing gradual relaxation for lower risk states. This temporal balancing reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths. Sensitivity to beta and I prevalence is considered; if beta increases or I rises in an origin state, fractions can be further shifted towards stricter early controls. Coordination ensures total flow per origin remains constant over 6 weeks, preserving travel demand while modulating weekly risk. This approach optimally mitigates Arizona's epidemic burden through targeted, time-phased traffic control."

This approach reduces the initial importation of exposed and infected individuals, thereby decreasing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. The total inbound flow per state is conserved by redistributing flow to later weeks, balancing epidemic control against the socio-economic need for mobility. By adjusting fractions based on relative prevalence (I and E) and flow volumes, the policy mitigates risk from high-prevalence, high-flow states like Texas and Virginia while allowing more relaxed controls where risk is lower. Sensitivity analysis indicates if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become more critical. Conversely, if prevalence declines, the fractions might be more evenly distributed. This coordinated temporal and cross-state strategy helps flatten the imported infection curve and protects public health in Arizona."

By decreasing ft in early weeks especially from high-prevalence origin states (Texas, New Mexico), we reduce immediate seeding risks when Arizona's susceptible population is still vulnerable and healthcare capacities could be strained. Later weeks see gradual relaxation balancing epidemic control with socio-economic mobility demands. This cross-state pattern leverages variations in prevalence and inbound flow to optimally distribute traffic, minimizing total imported infections over 6 weeks. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or beta increases, stricter early reductions would be even more effective, while lower prevalence could allow more even distributions. This adaptive, coordinated approach ensures a robust response to diverse origin state risks while preserving overall traffic volumes."
