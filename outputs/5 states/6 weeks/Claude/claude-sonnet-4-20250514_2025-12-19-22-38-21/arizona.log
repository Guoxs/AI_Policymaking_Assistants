Texas shows substantial deaths (D=18970) indicating severe outcomes. The large recovered population (R=1500726) suggests past waves but ongoing transmission risk. Early strict control (ft=0.08-0.16) reduces cumulative imported cases, with gradual relaxation preserving economic ties. Trade-off: short-term mobility restriction for long-term epidemic control in Arizona. Fractions sum: 0.08+0.12+0.16+0.18+0.22+0.24 = 1.0."

    "notes": "Virginia shows moderate-high infection pressure with I/population = 25834/9059554 = 0.285%. The baseline flow is smaller (5239.76) but infection rate is concerning. Using strict-first pattern given the infection prevalence exceeds Texas levels. Expected imported infections ~ 5239.76*ft*0.00285. High exposed population (E=107922) suggests potential future surge, requiring early restriction. Substantial confirmed cases (Q=171998) indicate active transmission. Early control (ft=0.10-0.16) minimizes imported infections during potential Virginia surge. Trade-off accepts reduced mobility for epidemic security. The gradual increase allows relationship maintenance while protecting Arizona. Validation: 0.10+0.14+0.16+0.18+0.20+0.22 = 1.0."

  "global_guidance": "The allocation strategy prioritizes Arizona's epidemic control through coordinated strict-first patterns across all origin states. Quantitative cooperation logic: total expected imported infections = Σ(Flow_i * ft_i * I_i/Pop_i). Early restriction (weeks 1-3) with low ft values minimizes cumulative imports during Arizona's vulnerable period (high E=139267 suggests potential surge). Cross-state reasoning shows Mississippi requires strictest control (highest infection rate 5.06%), followed by Virginia (0.285%), Texas (0.178%), and New Mexico (0.036%). However, flow volumes matter: Texas and New Mexico require substantial restriction despite lower rates due to high baseline flows. Sensitivity analysis: if beta increases, stricter early control becomes more critical; if Arizona's E population converts to I, imported cases compound local transmission exponentially. The coordinated approach reduces expected deaths through minimizing imported infections while preserving long-term economic relationships via gradual relaxation. Total flow conservation maintained while optimizing temporal distribution for epidemic control."
