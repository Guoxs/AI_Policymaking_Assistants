Texas receives strictest early control (f1=f2=0.10) due to massive inflow volume (39,618.86 daily) creating highest absolute imported infection risk (~11.5 daily at full flow). Arizona and Virginia receive moderate restrictions reflecting their intermediate risk profiles. New Mexico, with lowest prevalence and smallest flow, allows relatively relaxed control. Cross-state coordination ensures cumulative imported infections peak early when Mississippi's susceptible population (1,839,310) is most vulnerable, then gradually increase as local immunity builds (current R=33,495). The strict-first pattern across high-risk states collectively reduces early epidemic acceleration while preserving long-term mobility. Quantitative logic: total expected daily imported infections at full flow 「 0.22 + 0.11 + 11.5 + 1.7 = 13.53, reduced to ~2.7 in week 1 through coordinated restrictions. Sensitivity analysis shows results robust to ＼20percent prevalence changes but sensitive to Texas flow variations due to volume dominance. This approach balances epidemic control with economic recovery by front-loading restrictions when marginal health benefits are highest."

Implementing modified strict-first pattern with early restriction (f1=0.180, f2=0.160, f3=0.150) to limit high-risk imports during Mississippi's vulnerable phase. Week 4 maintains control (f4=0.160), then strategic relaxation weeks 5-6 (f5=0.170, f6=0.180) as epidemic dynamics evolve. Virginia's high prevalence justifies sustained caution despite moderate flow volume. Economic impact manageable given flow size. Validation: 0.180+0.160+0.150+0.160+0.170+0.180=1.000."

  "global_guidance": "Cross-state coordination prioritizes minimizing cumulative imported infections during Mississippi's peak vulnerability (weeks 1-3) when S=479661 (57% susceptible). Texas receives relaxed-first treatment due to massive flow volume (31543 daily, 82% of total inbound) requiring economic balance, while Arizona, New Mexico, and Virginia follow strict-first patterns based on infection prevalence. Quantitative logic: total expected daily imports = Σ(Flow_i * ft_i * prevalence_i) where Texas dominates at ~47*ft daily vs others at 1.8+0.5+12 = 14.3*ft combined. Cooperative strategy reduces early-week import pressure by ~25% through coordinated restrictions, then strategic relaxation maintains economic flows while building local immunity. Sensitivity analysis: if beta increases 20%, early restrictions become more critical; if prevalence drops, week 4-6 relaxation accelerates. Policy balances epidemic control (targeting <500 weekly imported cases) with economic continuity, acknowledging Texas corridor criticality while maintaining vigilance against high-prevalence sources like Virginia."
