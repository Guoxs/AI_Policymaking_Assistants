Quantitative cooperation logic: total expected imported infections ¡Ö ¦²(Flow_i * ft_i * prevalence_i), minimized through risk-weighted temporal distribution. Mississippi receives strictest early control (f1=0.100) due to 17percent prevalence, while New Mexico gets most relaxed treatment (f1=0.140) with 0.4percent prevalence. Virginia and Arizona receive intermediate controls reflecting moderate risks. Weekly progression allows economic recovery in later periods when local Texas conditions may improve (current Q=252472 suggests peak management phase). Sensitivity analysis: if beta increases by 10percent, recommend reducing all f1-f3 by 0.02; if prevalence drops 50percent in any state, increase that state's fractions by 0.03 each week. Strategy balances immediate epidemic control with economic sustainability across 6-week horizon."
