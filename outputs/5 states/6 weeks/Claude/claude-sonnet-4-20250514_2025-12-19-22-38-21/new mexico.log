Early strict controls on Mississippi (f1=0.08) prevent ~21 imported cases/week, while moderate Texas restrictions (f1=0.14) allow economic flow while limiting ~665 imported cases/week. Collective strategy minimizes cumulative imported infections (~743 cases/week in week 1) while preserving essential economic corridors.

Texas dominates absolute risk (248.5*ft potential weekly imports) requiring moderate sustained restriction. Mississippi poses highest per-capita risk (71.4*ft) warranting strictest early controls. Arizona and Virginia present manageable risks allowing gradual relaxation. Collective strict-first patterns exploit epidemic dynamics: early restrictions target peak infection periods, later relaxation assumes natural prevalence decline through recovery/immunity. Quantitative cooperation logic: total expected weekly imports = 24321.9*ft_AZ*(7860/8711360) + 1410.24*ft_MS*(37498/740684) + 139917.52*ft_TX*(40133/22567831) + 1327.76*ft_VA*(25834/9059754). Week 1 total 「 45 imported infections, declining to manageable levels by week 6. Sensitivity analysis: 10percent prevalence increase would raise imports proportionally, but strict-first patterns provide buffer. Strategy balances epidemic control (protecting S=9027686 susceptible) with mobility needs, using temporal allocation to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in new mexico.'
