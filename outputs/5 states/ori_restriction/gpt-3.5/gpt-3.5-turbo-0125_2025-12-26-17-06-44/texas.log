This decision is based on the risk assessment utilizing SEIRD indicators, where New Mexico has a higher average daily inbound flow and a relatively higher proportion of infected individuals. By reducing the inbound flow from New Mexico, we aim to minimize the potential importation of infections into Texas and control the spread of the disease. This restriction involves a 50percent reduction in inbound flow from New Mexico, which may help in mitigating the impact on the epidemic situation in Texas while considering the trade-offs between epidemic control and mobility disruption.'
