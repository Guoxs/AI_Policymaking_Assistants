Estimated imported infections from Texas approx=32267.21*(8710/(22342381+5380+8710+61264+406950+7451)) ~ high, making it the largest contributor to potential new cases. Arizona has a large population but very low inbound flow relative to Texas; New Mexico and Virginia have lower infected counts and smaller inflows. Prioritizing Texas for a 50percent inbound flow cut reduces imported infections substantially, likely minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Mississippi. Trade-offs include significant mobility disruption due to Texas's large flow, but the epidemic control benefit outweighs other states. Therefore, restricting Texas inbound traffic is optimal for epidemic control with acceptable disruption."

  "global_guidance": "Risk assessment shows texas has the highest absolute infected (I=7883) among origin states and a very large population (20,374,449). Its daily inbound flow into mississippi is also dominant at 42,422.64, much larger than others. Expected imported infections can be approximated as inbound_flow * (I / population). For texas, this is 42,422.64 * (7883 / 20,374,449) 「 16.42 infections per day; over 14 days about 230 infections potentially imported. Arizona, despite having more infections (I=13,033), has much lower inbound flow (2,273.43), resulting in about 2.6 expected infections per day. New mexico and virginia have smaller infected counts and lower flows, thus smaller import risk. Therefore, restricting inbound travel from texas by 50% would reduce imported infections significantly, roughly halving the expected imported infections from ~230 to ~115 over 2 weeks. The trade-off is some mobility disruption due to high traffic reduction from texas, but given the scale of inflow and infection risk, this is justified to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in mississippi. No other origin state offers as high impact reduction given their lower import infection risk and lower flow. Hence, texas is prioritized for the temporary inbound travel restriction."
