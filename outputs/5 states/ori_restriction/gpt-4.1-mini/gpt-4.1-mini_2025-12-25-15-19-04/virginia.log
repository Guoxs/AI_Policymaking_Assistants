The expected imported infections can be approximated as inbound_flow * (I / population). Texas's large inflow combined with its infectious population results in the highest expected imported infections by far. Restricting Texas's inbound flow by 50percent will substantially reduce imported infections, thus minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia over the two weeks. Although reducing flow from Texas will cause notable mobility disruption due to its volume, this trade-off is justified by the significant epidemic control benefit. Other states have lower inflow and/or lower infectious prevalence, making restrictions less impactful. Therefore, restricting Texas inbound travel is prioritized for optimal epidemic control in Virginia."
