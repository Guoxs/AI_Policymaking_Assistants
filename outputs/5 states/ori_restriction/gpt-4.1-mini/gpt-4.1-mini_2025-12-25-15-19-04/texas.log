  "global_guidance": "Risk assessment shows Virginia has the highest ratio of infectious individuals (I=31715) relative to its population (~13.44M susceptible, total much larger), indicating a significant infection prevalence. Although Arizona has a large population and inflow, its infection count (I=13033) is much lower than Virginia's, and New Mexico and Mississippi have substantially smaller infectious populations and inflows. Expected imported infections can be approximated as inbound_flow * (I / total_population). Virginia's infection prevalence combined with a non-negligible inflow (25501.93 daily) poses the highest risk of importing infections to Texas. Reducing Virginia's inbound flow by 50% cuts a significant source of imported infections with minimal disruption compared to restricting higher volume states like Arizona or New Mexico, which have lower infection prevalence. Hence, Virginia is prioritized for restriction to maximize epidemic control benefits while balancing mobility impact."

Expected imported infections can be approximated as inbound_flow * (I / population), yielding a significant import risk from Arizona.

Restricting Arizona's inbound flow by 50% will substantially reduce imported infections into Texas, helping curb case growth and deaths. The trade-off entails moderate mobility disruption due to Arizona's large flow, but this is justified by the higher epidemic risk. Other states, despite some risk, present less impact on Texas's epidemic trajectory. Thus, prioritizing Arizona restriction optimizes epidemic control with acceptable mobility impact."
