Quantitatively, expected imported infections are approximated as inbound_flow * (I / total population of origin). Virginia: I=27029, inflow=3922.5; Texas: I=7585, inflow=43017.86; New Mexico: I=332, inflow=27200.14; Mississippi: I=52, inflow=2067.29. Despite Texas having a larger inflow, Virginia¨s much higher infection prevalence results in a higher risk per traveler. Restricting Virginia¨s inbound flow by 50% reduces high-risk imports effectively, lowering cumulative cases and deaths in Arizona. Other states either have lower infection prevalence or smaller flows, making restrictions less impactful. The trade-off involves moderate disruption of travel from Virginia, which is justified by its disproportionate contribution to risk. Hence, Virginia is prioritized over others for temporary inbound travel restriction."
