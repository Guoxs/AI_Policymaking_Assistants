This trade-off strongly favors epidemic control due to texas's disproportionate contribution to infection importation compared to mobility disruption. Thus, restricting texas inbound flow is prioritized to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in new mexico over the next two weeks."

The next 14-day average daily inbound flow from texas into new mexico is the highest among all origins at 146,485.29. Expected imported infections can be roughly estimated as inbound_flow * (I / population), yielding a significant import risk from texas. Arizona has more infected (I=13033) but a much larger population, and its inbound flow into new mexico is lower (47,761). Mississippi and virginia have much lower infected counts and inbound flows. Restricting texas by 50% inbound flow reduces imported infections substantially, directly lowering new mexico's case importation risk. While this reduces mobility from texas, the trade-off favors epidemic control due to texas's dominant contribution to potential importation. No restriction or restricting other states would have less impact on reducing new mexico's imported cases and deaths. Therefore, applying a 50% inbound travel restriction on texas for two weeks is optimal."
