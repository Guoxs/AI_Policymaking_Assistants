Import risk is approximated by expected_imported_infections = inbound_flow * (I / total_population). Mississippi's inbound flow to Texas is moderate (42399.64) but infection prevalence is very high, leading to significant import risk. Arizona and New Mexico have higher flows but much lower infection prevalence, lowering their relative risk. Virginia has the lowest flow and moderate prevalence. Selecting Mississippi for 50percent inbound flow reduction halves a significant importation source of infections, likely reducing Texas' cumulative cases and deaths more effectively than restricting others. Trade-off: Mobility disruption is limited as Mississippi's flow is smaller than New Mexico's and Arizona's, minimizing economic impact. Thus, restricting Mississippi balances epidemic control and mobility impact best."

  "global_guidance": "Among the origin states, Virginia presents the highest infection prevalence ratio with I=31800 and E=134771 out of a population of approximately 14.4 million, indicating significant active and exposed cases. Calculating expected imported infections as inbound_flow * (I / population), Virginia's risk is substantial despite a lower inbound flow (~25502) compared to others. Arizona and New Mexico have higher inbound flows but lower infection ratios; Mississippi has both low inbound flow and low infections. Restricting Virginia's inbound flow by 50% reduces imported infections significantly, thereby lowering Texas's epidemic burden. The trade-off is moderate mobility disruption given Virginia's smaller flow compared to Arizona and New Mexico. Thus, prioritizing Virginia balances epidemic control and minimal mobility impact."

The expected imported infections can be roughly estimated as inbound_flow * (I / population). Virginia's inbound flow to Texas is 20566.29 daily, and its high I makes this flow a significant vector for infection import. Arizona, while having a large inbound flow, has a lower infection ratio. New Mexico and Mississippi have both lower infection ratios and inbound flows. By restricting Virginia's inbound flow by 50%, we reduce the imported infections significantly from the highest-risk source, minimizing Texas's cumulative cases and deaths. The trade-off is moderate disruption in mobility due to cutting flow from a relatively lower volume origin compared to Arizona and New Mexico, balancing epidemic control with mobility impact effectively."
