Expected imported infections 「 inbound_flow * (I / population) = 42422.64 * (10163 / 19162161) 「 22.5 infections/day, which is substantially higher than other states: arizona 「 0.22, new mexico 「 0.62, virginia 「 1.25. This indicates texas is the largest contributor to potential imported infections. Applying a 50% inbound travel restriction on texas reduces imported cases significantly, mitigating spread in mississippi. Arizona, despite large population, has very low inbound flow to mississippi; new mexico and virginia have lower infected counts and smaller flows, resulting in less import risk. The trade-off involves restricting a large mobility corridor, impacting travel and commerce, but the public health benefit outweighs the disruption given texas's high importation risk. Thus, restricting texas inbound travel for two weeks is the optimal policy to minimize cumulative cases and deaths."

  "global_guidance": "Risk assessment shows Texas has the highest number of infectious individuals (I=11375) relative to its large population (approx. 18.1 million) and a substantial inbound flow into Mississippi (average 35,070.57 daily). Expected imported infections from Texas 「 35070.57 * (11375 / 18130169) 「 22 daily infectious arrivals, significantly higher than other states: Arizona ~0.26, New Mexico ~0.83, Virginia ~10.8. Restricting Texas inbound flow by 50% reduces imported infectious cases by approximately 11 daily, markedly lowering potential seeding of new cases in Mississippi. Arizona and New Mexico have lower infectious proportions and flows, while Virginia's lower flow and infectious count imply less import risk. Although restricting Texas inflow impacts mobility substantially due to volume, the trade-off favors epidemic control given Mississippi's current active infections and vulnerability. Thus, the policy prioritizes restricting Texas to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next two weeks."
