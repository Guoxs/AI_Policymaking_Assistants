Although Texas has a higher inbound flow (129950) and a substantial infected count (I=10144), Virginia's much higher infection prevalence (I/population ratio) and exposed population present a greater importation risk per traveler. Expected imported infections roughly approximate inbound_flow * (I / total population). Virginia's infected ratio is about 0.00216 while Texas is about 0.0005, and Virginia's inbound flow is about 1,193 daily, so their importation risk is significant despite lower flow. Arizona and Mississippi have lower infected counts and smaller inflows, thus lower risks. Applying a 50percent inbound flow reduction from Virginia reduces imported infections significantly with minimal disruption since Virginia's baseline inflow is lowest among the origins. Restricting Virginia balances epidemic control by cutting high-risk importation while minimizing mobility disruption, prioritizing disease burden over flow volume. Thus, restricting inbound travel from Virginia offers the best trade-off for minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks."

The expected imported infections can be approximated as inbound_flow * (I / population). For Texas: 146,485 * (10,163 / 59,081,775) ~ 25.2 daily imported infections. Arizona also has a high inbound flow (47,761) but a lower infection ratio (I=12,866 in population ~ 12,488,956), yielding roughly 49.1 daily imported infections, but Arizona's daily inbound is about one-third of Texas. However, Texas's absolute inbound flow is much larger, leading to a larger cumulative import. Mississippi and Virginia have much lower inbound flows and infected counts, resulting in much lower import risks. Therefore, restricting inbound travel from Texas by 50% would reduce imported infections substantially, more than any other state. The trade-off is a significant mobility disruption from Texas, but this is justified by the high infection import risk. No other origin state matches Texas in import risk and volume, so Texas is prioritized for restriction to minimize New Mexico's cumulative cases and deaths."
