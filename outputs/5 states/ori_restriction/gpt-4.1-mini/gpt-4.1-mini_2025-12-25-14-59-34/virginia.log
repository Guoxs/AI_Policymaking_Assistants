Texas has a larger inbound flow (23945.93) but a lower infection prevalence (I=10144 out of ~21.5M), resulting in fewer imported infections (~11.3) but given the higher population and moderate infection rate, impact is significant but less intense than Arizona's prevalence ratio. Mississippi and New Mexico have lower inbound flows and infection counts leading to fewer imported infections. By restricting inbound travel from Arizona by 50percent, imported infection risk into Virginia can be significantly reduced while the mobility disruption is moderate due to Virginia's lower share of Arizona's outbound flow (3070 baseline daily). This trade-off prioritizes epidemic control with manageable mobility impact. Therefore, Arizona is prioritized over others for temporary inbound travel restrictions to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two weeks."

Arizona¨s high infection ratio and considerable inflow make it the highest risk for importing infections. Restricting Arizona's inbound flow by 50% reduces imported infections substantially while the displaced flow can be redistributed according to Arizona's baseline mobility. This balances epidemic control with minimizing overall mobility disruption.
