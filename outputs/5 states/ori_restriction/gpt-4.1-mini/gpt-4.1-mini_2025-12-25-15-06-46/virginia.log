Mississippi and new mexico have much smaller I and inflow, leading to negligible import risk. Restricting texas inbound flow by 50percent reduces daily imported infections by ~7, significantly lowering viral introduction risk to virginia. The trade-off is moderate mobility disruption from texas, but given its large flow and infection load, this yields the best epidemic control impact compared to other origins. Thus, restricting texas strikes an optimal balance between epidemic control and mobility preservation.'
