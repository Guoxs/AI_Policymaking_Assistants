Estimated imported infections are roughly proportional to inbound_flow * (I / population), and Virginia's elevated infection ratio magnifies risk.

Restricting Virginia reduces imported infections by 50%, effectively cutting a critical source of new cases. Although restricting Texas or New Mexico would impact larger traffic volumes, their lower infection prevalence makes restrictions less beneficial for epidemic control.
