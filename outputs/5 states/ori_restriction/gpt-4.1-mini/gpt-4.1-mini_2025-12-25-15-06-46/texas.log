2025-12-25 15:12:13,519 - texas - INFO - Parsed PolicyResponse: policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among origin states, Arizona shows the highest infection load with I=11597 out of ~10.6M susceptible population, indicating higher infection prevalence (~0.11percent). Its average inbound flow into Texas is substantial (52356.79 daily), leading to higher expected imported infections (~52356.79 * 11597 / total Arizona pop). Mississippi and New Mexico have much lower infected counts and/or lower inflows, reducing their risk contribution. Virginia has a moderate infected count (28757) but much lower inflow (20695.71), leading to lower import risk compared to Arizona. Restricting Arizona by 50percent inbound flow can significantly reduce imported infections, thus mitigating spread in Texas, which has a large susceptible population and ongoing infections. The trade-off is partial mobility disruption from Arizona but given its high risk, the benefit outweighs the cost. No other state provides as effective a reduction in imported infectious load given their lower inflow or infection prevalence. Therefore, restricting Arizona optimally balances epidemic control and mobility impact.'

Its daily inbound flow to Texas is 25501.93, which is moderate but significant. Expected imported infections can be approximated as inbound_flow * (I / population). Virginia's population sums to about 15.84 million, so infection prevalence ~0.21%. This results in an expected imported infection count of ~54 per day. Other states like Arizona have higher absolute flows (62207.57) but lower infection prevalence (~0.13%), resulting in similar or lower imported infections. Mississippi and New Mexico have lower infected counts and/or lower flows. Restricting Virginia by 50% inbound flow reduces imported infections by around 27 cases daily, which is meaningful to Texas's epidemic control given Virginia's high infection rate and exposure. Reallocation of the reduced flow is expected to distribute infections but not concentrate them in Texas. Trade-off favors restricting Virginia due to high infection prevalence despite moderate flow, balancing epidemic control with limited mobility disruption compared to restricting higher flow states with lower prevalence."
