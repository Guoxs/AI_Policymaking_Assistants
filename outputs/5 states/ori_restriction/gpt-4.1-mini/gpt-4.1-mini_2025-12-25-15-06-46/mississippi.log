The expected imported infections can be approximated as inbound_flow * (I / population). Texas's large infected population combined with high mobility leads to the highest potential importation risk of infections. Arizona has a very large inflow but a much lower I (3919) relative to population, resulting in lower expected import risk. Virginia and New Mexico have lower infected populations and inbound flows. Restricting Texas by reducing its inbound flow by 50percent will significantly reduce imported infections and thus cumulative cases and deaths in Mississippi over two weeks. The trade-off is substantial mobility disruption from Texas, but given the epidemic control priority and Texas's dominant risk, this policy is justified. No restriction on other states is more beneficial overall."
