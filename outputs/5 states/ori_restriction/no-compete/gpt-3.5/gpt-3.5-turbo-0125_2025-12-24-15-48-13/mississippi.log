  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the state of Texas is selected for a temporary inbound travel restriction to Mississippi for the next two weeks. 

- Risk assessment: Texas has a relatively high average number of infected individuals and deaths in the past 21 days compared to the other origin states. This indicates a higher risk of potential spread of the disease through inbound travel.
- Quantitative import logic: The expected imported infections can be estimated by considering the inbound flow from Texas to Mississippi and the proportion of infected individuals in Texas. The higher the infected population in Texas, the higher the potential imported infections.
- Justification of selection: Texas is prioritized over the other origin states due to its higher number of infected individuals and deaths, indicating a higher risk of disease transmission. By implementing a temporary inbound travel restriction from Texas to Mississippi, the aim is to reduce the risk of importing new cases and ultimately minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi.
- Trade-offs: The restriction on inbound travel from Texas may disrupt mobility and economic activities between the two states. However, the potential benefits in terms of controlling the spread of the disease and reducing the burden on the healthcare system in Mississippi outweigh the temporary mobility disruptions."
