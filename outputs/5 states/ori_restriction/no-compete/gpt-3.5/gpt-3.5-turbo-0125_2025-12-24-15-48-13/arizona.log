- Risk assessment: New Mexico has a relatively high average daily inbound flow to Arizona and a significant number of confirmed and active cases, indicating a potential risk of importing infections. By reducing the inbound flow from New Mexico, we can decrease the risk of introducing new cases to Arizona.
- Quantitative import logic: The expected imported infections from New Mexico to Arizona can be estimated by multiplying the inbound flow from New Mexico to Arizona by the ratio of active cases in New Mexico to its population.
- Justification of selection: New Mexico is prioritized over other origin states due to its relatively high inbound flow and the presence of active cases. By implementing a restriction on inbound travel from New Mexico, we can effectively reduce the risk of disease spread in Arizona.
- Trade-offs: While the restriction may disrupt mobility between New Mexico and Arizona, it is a necessary measure to protect the health and well-being of the population in Arizona and prevent further spread of the disease."

  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, I recommend implementing a temporary inbound travel restriction from New Mexico for the next two weeks. 

1. Risk assessment: New Mexico has a relatively small population compared to Texas and Mississippi, but it has a higher average daily inbound flow into Arizona. This indicates a potentially higher risk of importing infections from New Mexico due to the larger flow of people.
2. Quantitative import logic: The expected imported infections from New Mexico are estimated to be higher compared to the other origin states due to its higher inbound flow and the current number of infected individuals.
3. Justification of selection: New Mexico is prioritized over the other origin states due to the combination of higher inbound flow and the potential risk of importing infections. Restricting travel from New Mexico can help reduce the influx of infected individuals into Arizona and minimize the spread of the disease.
4. Trade-offs: Implementing this travel restriction may disrupt mobility between the two states and have economic implications. However, the priority is to control the epidemic and protect the health and safety of the population in Arizona."
