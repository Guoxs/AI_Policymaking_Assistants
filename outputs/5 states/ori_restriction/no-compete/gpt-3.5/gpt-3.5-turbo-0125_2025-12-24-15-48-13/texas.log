Intervention reasoning:
1. Risk assessment: New Mexico has a relatively high average daily inbound flow into Texas compared to the other origin states. Additionally, New Mexico has a moderate number of infected and confirmed cases, indicating a potential risk of importing infections into Texas.
2. Quantitative import logic: The expected imported infections from New Mexico into Texas can be estimated as inbound flow * (I / population).
3. Justification of selection: New Mexico is prioritized over the other origin states due to its significant inbound flow and the potential risk it poses in terms of disease spread.
4. Trade-offs: While the restriction may disrupt mobility between New Mexico and Texas, it is crucial to prioritize epidemic control and reduce the risk of further spreading the virus in Texas."

### Intervention reasoning:
1. **Risk assessment:** New Mexico has a relatively higher average daily inflow into Texas compared to other origin states. Additionally, New Mexico has a significant number of exposed individuals, increasing the risk of importing infections into Texas.
2. **Quantitative import logic:** The expected imported infections from New Mexico into Texas is estimated to be relatively higher compared to other origin states based on the SEIQRD indicators and the average daily inflow.
3. **Justification of selection:** New Mexico is prioritized over other states due to its higher risk of contributing to the spread of the disease in Texas.
4. **Trade-offs:** While implementing the travel restriction may disrupt mobility and have economic implications, it is necessary to prioritize epidemic control and minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas over the following two weeks."
