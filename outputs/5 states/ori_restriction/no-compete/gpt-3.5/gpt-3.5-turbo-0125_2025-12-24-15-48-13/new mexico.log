  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the state of Texas is recommended to be the origin state for the temporary inbound travel restriction. 

1. Risk assessment: Texas has a relatively high number of infected individuals compared to the other origin states, indicating a higher risk of imported infections. The SEIRD parameters suggest a significant potential for disease spread.

2. Quantitative import logic: The expected imported infections from Texas into New Mexico can be estimated as inbound flow * (I / population), which is relatively high compared to other states due to the large number of infected individuals.

3. Justification of selection: Texas is prioritized over other states due to its high number of infected individuals and the potential impact on disease spread in New Mexico. Restricting inbound travel from Texas can help minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico.

4. Trade-offs: Implementing the travel restriction from Texas may disrupt mobility and connections between the two states, impacting economic and social activities. However, the priority is to control the spread of the disease and protect the population of New Mexico."

  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the state of Texas is selected for a temporary inbound travel restriction for the next two weeks. 

1. Risk Assessment:
   - Texas has a relatively high number of infected individuals (I) and confirmed cases (Q) compared to other origin states. This indicates a higher risk of importing infections into New Mexico.
   
2. Quantitative Import Logic:
   - The expected imported infections can be estimated as inbound flow * (I / population). With Texas having a high I value and a substantial inbound flow, the potential for importing infections is significant.
   
3. Justification of Selection:
   - Texas is prioritized over other origin states due to its larger population size, higher number of infected individuals, and substantial inbound flow. Restricting travel from Texas can help reduce the risk of importing new infections into New Mexico.
   
4. Trade-offs:
   - Implementing a travel restriction from Texas may disrupt mobility and travel between the two states, impacting economic activities and social interactions. However, the primary focus is on controlling the spread of the disease and protecting the population of New Mexico from additional cases and potential deaths."
