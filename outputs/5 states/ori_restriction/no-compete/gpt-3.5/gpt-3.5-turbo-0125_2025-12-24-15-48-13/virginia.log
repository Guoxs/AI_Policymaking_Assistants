  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the origin state of Texas is prioritized for a temporary inbound travel restriction for the next two weeks. 

1. Risk assessment:
   - Texas has a significant number of confirmed cases and deaths compared to the other origin states. This indicates a high level of virus circulation within the state.
   - The SEIRD parameters suggest a relatively high transmission rate (beta) and a high rate of progression from exposed to infected individuals (alpha).

2. Quantitative import logic:
   - The expected imported infections ¡Ö inbound flow * (I / population) for Texas is higher compared to other origin states due to its larger infected population and inbound flow.

3. Justification of selection:
   - Texas is prioritized for restriction over other origin states due to its higher risk of importing infections into Virginia based on the SEIRD indicators and inbound flow data.

4. Trade-offs:
   - Implementing a temporary inbound travel restriction from Texas may help reduce the risk of additional cases and deaths in Virginia. However, this policy may disrupt mobility and trade between the two states, impacting economic activities and social interactions."

  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the origin state of Arizona is selected for a temporary inbound travel restriction to Virginia for the next two weeks. 

1. Risk Assessment:
   - Arizona has a relatively high number of confirmed cases and deaths compared to the other origin states. This indicates a higher risk of importing infections into Virginia.
   
2. Quantitative Import Logic:
   - The expected imported infections from Arizona to Virginia can be estimated as inbound_flow * (I / population). With a higher I value in Arizona, the expected imported infections are significant.

3. Justification of Selection:
   - Arizona is prioritized over the other origin states due to its higher number of cases and potential to contribute more to the spread of the disease in Virginia.

4. Trade-offs:
   - By implementing a 50% reduction in inbound travel from Arizona, Virginia aims to reduce the risk of importing new infections and potentially decrease the burden on its healthcare system. However, this policy may disrupt mobility and economic activities between the two states for the next two weeks."
