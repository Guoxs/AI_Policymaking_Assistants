1. Risk assessment: Texas has a relatively higher average daily inbound flow into Mississippi compared to the other origin states. Additionally, Texas has a larger number of infected individuals in its population, indicating a higher risk of potential importation of cases.

2. Quantitative import logic: The expected imported infections from Texas to Mississippi can be estimated as inbound flow * (I / population), where I represents the number of infected individuals in Texas. This calculation suggests a significant potential for imported infections from Texas.

3. Justification of selection: Texas is selected over the other origin states due to its combination of high inbound flow and a relatively higher number of infected individuals. By implementing a 50% reduction in inbound travel from Texas, we aim to mitigate the risk of accelerating the spread of the disease in Mississippi.

4. Trade-offs: While the restriction may lead to some disruptions in mobility and economic activities between Texas and Mississippi, the primary goal is to prioritize public health and minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next two weeks."

  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the state of Texas is selected for a temporary inbound travel restriction to Mississippi for the next two weeks. 

### Intervention Reasoning:
1. **Risk Assessment**: Texas has the highest average daily inbound flow into Mississippi among the origin states, indicating a higher potential for disease transmission. Additionally, Texas has a relatively high number of infected individuals compared to the other states, which increases the risk of importing new cases into Mississippi.
2. **Quantitative Import Logic**: The expected imported infections from Texas can be estimated using the formula: expected_imported_infections ¡Ö inbound_flow * (I / population). Given the high inbound flow and number of infected individuals in Texas, the impact of imported infections is significant.
3. **Justification of Selection**: Texas is prioritized over the other states due to its high inbound flow, high number of infected individuals, and the potential impact on disease spread in Mississippi.
4. **Trade-offs**: While the restriction may disrupt mobility between Texas and Mississippi, it is necessary to reduce the risk of a surge in cases in Mississippi and protect public health.

By implementing a temporary inbound travel restriction from Texas to Mississippi, the goal is to minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next two weeks."

  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the state of Texas is recommended for a temporary inbound travel restriction for the next two weeks. 

1. Risk assessment: Texas has a relatively high average daily inbound flow into Mississippi over the past 21 days compared to the other origin states. This indicates a higher potential for importing infected individuals into Mississippi, which could contribute to an increase in confirmed cases and deaths.

2. Quantitative import logic: The expected imported infections from Texas can be estimated as inbound_flow * (I / population), where I represents the average number of infected individuals in Texas. By reducing the inbound flow from Texas by 50%, we can effectively decrease the number of potential imported infections into Mississippi.

3. Justification of selection: Texas is prioritized for the travel restriction over the other origin states due to its higher average daily inbound flow and the potential impact on the spread of the disease in Mississippi. Restricting travel from Texas can help mitigate the risk of additional cases and fatalities in Mississippi.

4. Trade-offs: Implementing a temporary inbound travel restriction from Texas may disrupt mobility and travel between the two states. However, the trade-off is necessary to prioritize public health and reduce the burden on the healthcare system in Mississippi."
