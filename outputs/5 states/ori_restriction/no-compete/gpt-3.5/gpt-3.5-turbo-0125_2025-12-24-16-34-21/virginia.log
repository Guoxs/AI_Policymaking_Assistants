  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the state of Texas is selected for a temporary inbound travel restriction for the next two weeks. 

1. Risk assessment: Texas has a relatively high average daily inbound flow into Virginia and a significant population size. The SEIRD indicators suggest that there are a considerable number of infected individuals in Texas, which increases the risk of imported infections into Virginia.

2. Quantitative import logic: The expected imported infections from Texas into Virginia can be estimated as inbound flow from Texas * (I / population). With a high number of infected individuals in Texas, the potential for importing infections into Virginia is significant.

3. Justification of selection: Texas is prioritized over the other origin states due to its high inbound flow, large population, and significant number of infected individuals. Restricting inbound travel from Texas can help reduce the risk of additional infections in Virginia.

4. Trade-offs: Implementing a temporary travel restriction from Texas may disrupt mobility and trade between the two states. However, the primary focus is on minimizing the spread of the disease and protecting the population of Virginia, which outweighs the temporary disruption in mobility."
