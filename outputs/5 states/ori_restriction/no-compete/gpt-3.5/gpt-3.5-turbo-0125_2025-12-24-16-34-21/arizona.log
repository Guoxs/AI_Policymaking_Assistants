  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the state of New Mexico is selected for a temporary inbound travel restriction to Arizona for the next two weeks. 

1. Risk assessment: New Mexico has a relatively smaller population compared to Texas and Mississippi, but it has a higher average daily inbound flow to Arizona. This indicates a higher risk of potential disease spread through travel from New Mexico.
2. Quantitative import logic: The expected imported infections can be estimated as inbound_flow * (I / population). Given the higher inbound flow from New Mexico and the current number of infected individuals in New Mexico, the potential for importing infections into Arizona is significant.
3. Justification of selection: New Mexico is prioritized over other states due to its higher average daily inbound flow and the relatively smaller population, which suggests a higher per capita mobility rate towards Arizona. Restricting travel from New Mexico can help reduce the risk of disease importation and transmission in Arizona.
4. Trade-offs: Implementing a travel restriction from New Mexico may impact mobility and interstate relations. However, the primary goal is to minimize the spread of the disease and protect the population of Arizona, which outweighs the temporary disruption in mobility."

  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the recommended policy is to apply a temporary inbound travel restriction on New Mexico for the next two weeks. 

1. Risk assessment: New Mexico has a relatively higher average daily inflow into Arizona compared to the other origin states. Additionally, the SEIRD indicators show that New Mexico has a significant number of exposed and infected individuals, indicating a potential risk of importing infections into Arizona.

2. Quantitative import logic: The expected imported infections from New Mexico can be estimated as inbound_flow * (I / population). Given the high inbound flow from New Mexico and the number of infected individuals, the potential importation of infections is a concern.

3. Justification of selection: New Mexico is prioritized over the other origin states due to its higher inflow and the higher number of infected individuals. By implementing a 50% reduction in inbound flow from New Mexico, we aim to mitigate the risk of further spreading the disease in Arizona.

4. Trade-offs: While the restriction may disrupt mobility and travel between New Mexico and Arizona, the primary goal is to reduce the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona by limiting the importation of infections from high-risk areas."
