  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the state of Texas should implement a temporary inbound travel restriction for the next two weeks on New Mexico. 

Risk assessment based on SEIQRD indicators shows that New Mexico has a relatively higher average number of infected individuals compared to its population size. By reducing the inbound flow from New Mexico by 50%, we can potentially decrease the number of imported infections into Texas, helping to minimize the spread of the disease within the state.

The selection of New Mexico over other origin states is justified by the higher average daily inbound flow from New Mexico to Texas, as well as the higher average number of infected individuals in New Mexico, indicating a potential higher risk of disease importation.

Implementing this restriction involves a trade-off between controlling the epidemic and disrupting mobility. While the restriction may impact travel and economic activities between the two states, the primary goal is to protect public health and prevent a surge in COVID-19 cases and deaths in Texas."

  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the state of New Mexico is selected for a temporary inbound travel restriction for the next 2 weeks. 

1. Risk assessment:
   - New Mexico has a significant number of individuals in the Exposed (E) and Infected (I) compartments, indicating an ongoing transmission of the disease within the state.
   - The high number of Confirmed cases (Q) and Deaths (D) also suggest a concerning situation in New Mexico.

2. Quantitative import logic:
   - Expected imported infections ¡Ö Inbound flow * (I / population) 
   - New Mexico's high inbound flow and the proportion of infected individuals make it a potential source of new infections for Texas.

3. Justification of selection:
   - New Mexico is prioritized over other states due to its relatively higher risk indicators and significant inbound flow to Texas.
   - By implementing a temporary restriction on inbound travel from New Mexico, we aim to reduce the potential importation of new cases into Texas and mitigate the spread of the disease.

4. Trade-offs:
   - Implementing the restriction may temporarily disrupt mobility between the two states, but the primary focus is on safeguarding public health and minimizing the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas over the next 2 weeks."
