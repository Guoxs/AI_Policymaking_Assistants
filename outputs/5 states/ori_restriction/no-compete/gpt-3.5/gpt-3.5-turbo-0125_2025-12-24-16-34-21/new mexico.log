1. Risk assessment: Texas has a significant number of infected individuals compared to other origin states, with a high average daily inflow into New Mexico. The SEIRD parameters indicate a higher risk of transmitting the disease through inbound travel.

2. Quantitative import logic: The expected imported infections from Texas is relatively high due to its large infected population and high inbound flow into New Mexico.

3. Justification of selection: Texas is prioritized over the other origin states due to its combination of high infected population, high inbound flow, and significant risk of disease transmission. Restricting travel from Texas can help reduce the influx of infected individuals into New Mexico, potentially lowering the spread of the disease.

4. Trade-offs: Implementing a travel restriction from Texas may disrupt mobility and economic activities between the two states. However, the priority is to minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks, which justifies the temporary restriction on inbound travel from Texas."
