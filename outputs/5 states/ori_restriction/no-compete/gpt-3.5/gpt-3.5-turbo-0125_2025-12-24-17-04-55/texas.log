  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the state of New Mexico is recommended for a temporary inbound travel restriction for the next two weeks. 

1. Risk assessment: New Mexico has a relatively high number of exposed individuals and infected individuals compared to its population size. This indicates a higher risk of disease spread through inbound travel.

2. Quantitative import logic: By considering the expected imported infections as a function of inbound flow and infected individuals in New Mexico, a higher number of potential cases are expected to be imported into Texas from New Mexico compared to the other origin states.

3. Justification of selection: New Mexico is prioritized over the other origin states due to its higher number of exposed and infected individuals, indicating a higher risk of disease transmission. By implementing a temporary inbound travel restriction, the goal is to minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas over the next two weeks.

4. Trade-offs: The restriction on inbound travel from New Mexico may disrupt mobility and travel patterns between the two states. However, the potential reduction in imported infections can help in controlling the spread of the disease within Texas, ultimately leading to a lower burden on the healthcare system and fewer fatalities."
