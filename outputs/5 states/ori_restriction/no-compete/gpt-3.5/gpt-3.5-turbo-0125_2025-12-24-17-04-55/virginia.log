Arizona is prioritized due to its higher average daily inbound flow into Virginia compared to the other origin states. By reducing the inbound flow from Arizona by 50percent, we aim to minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia over the full 2-week horizon. This restriction is a trade-off between controlling the epidemic spread and disrupting mobility. The expected imported infections from Arizona, based on the SEIQRD indicators, make it a suitable candidate for intervention.'
