  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the origin state 'texas' is selected for a temporary inbound travel restriction to new mexico for the next two weeks. 

1. Risk assessment: Texas has the highest average daily inbound flow into new mexico among the origin states. It also has a relatively higher number of infected individuals compared to other states, indicating a higher risk of importing cases.

2. Quantitative import logic: The expected imported infections can be estimated as inbound_flow * (I / population). With a significant inbound flow and a considerable number of infected individuals, restricting travel from Texas can potentially reduce the number of imported cases into new mexico.

3. Justification of selection: Texas is prioritized over the other origin states due to its high inbound flow and higher number of infected individuals. By implementing a temporary inbound travel restriction from Texas, new mexico aims to minimize the risk of additional cases being imported into the state.

4. Trade-offs: While the restriction may disrupt mobility and have economic implications, the primary focus is on controlling the spread of the disease and protecting the population of new mexico. The 50% reduction in inbound flow from Texas aims to strike a balance between epidemic control and minimizing mobility disruption."

  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, we recommend implementing a temporary inbound travel restriction for the state of Texas to New Mexico for the next two weeks. 

1. Risk assessment: Texas has a relatively high number of infected individuals and deaths compared to the other origin states. This indicates a higher risk of potential disease spread through inbound travel.

2. Quantitative import logic: By reducing the inbound flow from Texas by 50%, we can potentially limit the importation of infected individuals into New Mexico. The expected imported infections can be estimated as inbound_flow * (I / population), which justifies the need for this restriction.

3. Justification of selection: Texas is prioritized over the other origin states due to its higher numbers of infected individuals and deaths, indicating a higher risk of spreading the disease to New Mexico.

4. Trade-offs: While the restriction may disrupt mobility and economic activities between Texas and New Mexico, the potential reduction in imported infections can help minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks."

  Risk assessment based on SEIQRD indicators indicates that Texas has a higher average daily inbound flow into New Mexico compared to other origin states. This suggests a higher risk of importation of infections from Texas. 
  
  The quantitative import logic also supports this decision, as the expected imported infections from Texas into New Mexico is relatively higher due to the larger population and higher number of infectious individuals in Texas.

  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, I recommend implementing a temporary inbound travel restriction from Arizona to New Mexico for the next two weeks. 

1. Risk assessment: Arizona has a higher average daily inbound flow compared to other origin states, indicating a higher potential risk of imported infections. Additionally, Arizona has a higher number of confirmed cases, which suggests a higher disease prevalence.

2. Quantitative import logic: The expected imported infections from Arizona to New Mexico can be estimated as inbound flow * (I / population), which shows a significant impact on disease spread.

3. Justification of selection: Arizona is prioritized over other origin states due to its higher inbound flow, higher disease prevalence, and higher risk of imported infections. Implementing a 50% reduction in inbound flow from Arizona can help mitigate the risk of spreading the disease in New Mexico.

4. Trade-offs: While the travel restriction may cause some disruption in mobility between the two states, the potential reduction in imported infections can help minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks."

  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the origin state of Texas is recommended for a temporary inbound travel restriction for the next two weeks. 

Risk assessment based on SEIQRD indicators shows that Texas has a relatively high number of infectious individuals (I) compared to its population size. This indicates a higher likelihood of exporting infections to New Mexico through inbound travel. 

Quantitative import logic supports this decision, as the expected imported infections from Texas to New Mexico can be approximated by the product of the inbound flow from Texas and the ratio of infectious individuals in Texas to its total population.

Prioritizing the restriction on Texas over the other origin states is justified by the significant inbound flow from Texas to New Mexico, combined with the higher number of infectious individuals in Texas. By reducing the inbound flow from Texas, we aim to minimize the risk of importing additional cases into New Mexico and help control the spread of the disease within the state.

The trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption is considered in this decision. While the restriction may temporarily impact travel and economic activities between Texas and New Mexico, the primary goal is to protect public health and prevent further transmission of the virus within New Mexico."
