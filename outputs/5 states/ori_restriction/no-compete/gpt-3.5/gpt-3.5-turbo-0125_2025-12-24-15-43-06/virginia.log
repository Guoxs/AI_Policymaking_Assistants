1. Risk assessment: Arizona has a relatively high number of infected individuals and deaths compared to the other origin states. This indicates a higher risk of importing infections into Virginia.

2. Quantitative import logic: Based on the SEIRD indicators and past inflow data, the expected imported infections from Arizona to Virginia is relatively high compared to other states.

3. Justification of selection: Arizona is prioritized over the other origin states due to its higher numbers of infected individuals and deaths, as well as the higher expected imported infections.

4. Trade-offs: While the restriction may disrupt mobility between Arizona and Virginia, it is essential to prioritize epidemic control to minimize the spread of the disease and protect the population of Virginia."

2. **Quantitative import logic**: The expected imported infections from Texas are estimated to be higher due to the larger Infected (I) population and inbound flow.
