{

  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the state of Arizona should implement a temporary inbound travel restriction on New Mexico for the next two weeks. 

1. Risk assessment: New Mexico has a relatively high average daily inbound flow into Arizona over the past 21 days, indicating a significant level of mobility between the two states. The SEIRD indicators show that New Mexico has a higher number of exposed and infected individuals compared to other origin states, suggesting a potential risk of importing infections into Arizona.

2. Quantitative import logic: The expected imported infections from New Mexico can be estimated using the formula: expected_imported_infections ¡Ö inbound_flow * (I / population). With a high average daily inbound flow and a relatively high number of infected individuals in New Mexico, the potential for importing infections into Arizona is significant.

3. Justification of selection: New Mexico is prioritized for the travel restriction over other origin states due to its combination of high inbound flow and a relatively high number of infected individuals. By implementing a 50% reduction in inbound flow from New Mexico, Arizona aims to reduce the risk of additional disease spread within its borders.

4. Trade-offs: While the travel restriction may cause some disruption to mobility and interstate connections, the primary goal is to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona. By temporarily reducing inbound flow from New Mexico, Arizona can better control and manage the spread of the disease within its population."

  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the state of Arizona is recommended to implement a temporary inbound travel restriction for the next two weeks specifically targeting New Mexico. 

### Intervention reasoning:
1. **Risk assessment**: New Mexico has a relatively higher average daily inbound flow into Arizona compared to other origin states. Additionally, New Mexico has a higher average number of infectious individuals (I) in its population composition over the past 21 days, indicating a potential higher risk of transmission.
2. **Quantitative import logic**: The expected imported infections from New Mexico to Arizona can be estimated as inbound flow * (I / population), which is relatively high for New Mexico compared to other origin states.
3. **Justification of selection**: New Mexico is prioritized over other origin states due to its combination of higher inbound flow and higher average infectious cases, making it a significant potential source of imported infections into Arizona.
4. **Trade-offs**: While implementing a travel restriction may disrupt mobility between the states, the primary focus is on reducing the risk of disease spread and minimizing the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona over the next two weeks."
