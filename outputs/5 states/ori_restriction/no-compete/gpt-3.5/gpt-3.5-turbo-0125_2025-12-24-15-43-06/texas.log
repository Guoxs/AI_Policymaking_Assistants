  The risk assessment based on SEIQRD indicators shows that New Mexico has a higher average daily inbound flow into Texas compared to other origin states. By implementing a 50% reduction in inbound flow from New Mexico, we can effectively lower the potential import of infections into Texas. 
  This decision is justified by the fact that New Mexico has a significant number of confirmed cases and deaths in the past 14 days, indicating a higher risk of disease spread. 
  The trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption is deemed acceptable in this case, as the reduction in inbound flow can help minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas over the next two weeks."

  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, I recommend implementing a temporary inbound travel restriction from New Mexico to Texas for the next two weeks. 

Risk assessment: New Mexico has a higher average number of daily inbound travelers to Texas compared to other origin states. Additionally, New Mexico has a relatively higher number of confirmed cases and deaths in the past 21 days, indicating a potential higher risk of disease spread.

Quantitative import logic: By reducing the inbound flow from New Mexico by 50%, we can potentially decrease the number of expected imported infections into Texas, as the inbound flow is directly proportional to the infected population in the origin state.

Justification of selection: New Mexico is prioritized over other origin states due to its higher inbound flow and higher disease indicators. By implementing a temporary restriction from New Mexico, we aim to mitigate the risk of increased infections in Texas.

Trade-offs: The restriction may lead to some mobility disruptions and economic impacts, but the primary goal is to prioritize public health and reduce the spread of the disease in Texas."
