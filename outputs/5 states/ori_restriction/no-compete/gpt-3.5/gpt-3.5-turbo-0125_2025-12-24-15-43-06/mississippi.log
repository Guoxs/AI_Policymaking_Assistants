  "global_guidance": "To minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next two weeks, the recommended traffic control policy is to implement a temporary inbound travel restriction from Texas. 

### Intervention reasoning:
1. Risk assessment: Texas has a relatively higher average daily inbound flow into Mississippi compared to the other origin states, indicating a higher potential for importation of infections. With a significant number of infected and exposed individuals in Texas, the risk of introducing new cases to Mississippi is heightened.
2. Quantitative import logic: The expected imported infections from Texas to Mississippi can be approximated by multiplying the inbound flow by the ratio of infected individuals in Texas to its population.
3. Justification of selection: Texas is prioritized over the other origin states due to its higher inbound flow and the presence of a considerable number of infected and exposed individuals. Restricting travel from Texas can help reduce the influx of new cases into Mississippi, thereby potentially lowering the burden on the healthcare system and preventing further spread of the disease.
4. Trade-offs: While the restriction may cause mobility disruption and economic impacts, the priority is to safeguard public health and prevent a surge in confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi."
