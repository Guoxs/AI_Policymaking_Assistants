  "global_guidance": "Risk assessment shows Texas has the highest number of infected individuals (I=40630) among origin states, combined with the largest daily inbound flow to Mississippi (42422.64). Expected imported infections roughly estimated as inbound_flow * (I / population) indicate Texas contributes significantly more potential infection importation than other states. Arizona has a lower I and much smaller inflow to Mississippi (2273.43), New Mexico's infected count and inflow are even smaller, and Virginia's infected count is moderate but inflow is far less than Texas. Applying a 50% inbound travel restriction on Texas reduces imported infections substantially, helping mitigate outbreak growth in Mississippi. The trade-off involves mobility disruption from Texas, but since Texas is the dominant source of incoming travelers, focusing restriction here maximizes epidemic control benefits with relatively limited mobility impact on other connections. No restriction or restricting other states would yield less case reduction due to their smaller import risk."

No other states offer as impactful a reduction in imported infections. Hence, restricting texas maximizes epidemic control benefits while balancing mobility impact."
