2025-12-25 14:55:47,160 - arizona - INFO - Parsed PolicyResponse: policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Mississippi exhibits the highest infection prevalence relative to its population, with I=397666 out of roughly 3.7 million (sum of SEIQRD), indicating a very high infection rate (~10.7percent). Despite a lower absolute inbound flow to Arizona (2067.29 daily), its high infection density means imported infections are significant. Expected imported infections 「 2067.29 * (397666 / 3,700,000) 「 222 daily. In contrast, Texas has a higher inbound flow (43017.86) but a lower infection ratio (I=44603 / ~26 million 「 0.17percent), yielding fewer imported infections (~73 daily). New Mexico and Virginia have both lower infection ratios and lower inbound flows, resulting in lower import risks. Restricting Mississippi reduces imported infections by half, cutting approximately 111 infections daily, significantly aiding Arizona's epidemic control. The trade-off is minimal mobility disruption due to Mississippi's relatively low inbound flow compared to Texas and New Mexico. Thus, restricting Mississippi balances maximal epidemic benefit with modest mobility impact, justifying its priority over other states."
