  "global_guidance": "Mississippi exhibits the highest infection prevalence among origin states with I=153225 and a very high exposed count E=280057 relative to its population (~2.1 million total active cases). Despite having a moderate inbound flow to Virginia (~4443), its high infection ratio (I/population) implies a significant risk of importing infections. Arizona and Texas have larger inflows (5341 and 24444 respectively), but their infection counts are substantially lower (I=2394 for Arizona, I=21775 for Texas), reducing their relative import risk. New Mexico has both low inflow and low infection counts, posing minimal import risk. Applying a 50% restriction on Mississippi reduces inbound infections most effectively, thus minimizing imported cases and subsequent local spread. The trade-off involves moderate mobility disruption from Mississippi, which is lower than restricting Texas or Arizona whose higher flows would cause more disruption.

New mexico has low infections and low flow, so minimal risk. Restricting mississippi reduces inbound infections by 50%, significantly cutting imported cases.

Calculating expected imported infections as inbound_flow * (I / population), Mississippi's risk is approximately 3862.64 * (263702 / 302325) 「 3369 infections/day, which is significantly higher than Arizona (~6125 * (10928 / 6890114) 「 9.7), New Mexico (~1680 * (4550 / 6057687) 「 1.3), and Texas (~25924 * (39326 / 20981220) 「 48.6). Given this, restricting inbound flow from Mississippi by 50% would substantially reduce imported infections into Virginia. Although this reduces mobility from Mississippi, the trade-off strongly favors epidemic control due to the high infection prevalence there. Other states have much lower relative infection prevalence or higher inflow but proportionally lower infected fractions. Therefore, restricting Mississippi optimally minimizes cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two weeks."
