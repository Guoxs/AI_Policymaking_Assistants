  "global_guidance": "Assessment of each origin state considers infection prevalence and inbound flow to Texas. Mississippi has a very high infected count (I=334349) relative to its population, and a considerable exposed population (E=354274), indicating high transmission risk. Although its average daily inbound flow to Texas (52516.93) is somewhat lower than New Mexico's (83532.86) and Arizona's (62207.57), the infection prevalence ratio (I/population) for Mississippi is significantly higher, resulting in higher expected imported infections. Expected imported infections are approximated by inbound_flow * (I / total population), which for Mississippi yields the highest risk. Arizona and New Mexico have lower infection prevalence despite high flows, and Virginia's infected numbers and flow are both lower. Restricting Mississippi's inbound flow by 50% reduces imported infections substantially, outweighing mobility disruption since Mississippi's flow is moderate compared to others. The reallocation of the reduced flow to other destinations follows baseline patterns, preventing total loss of mobility. Therefore, restricting Mississippi optimally balances epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs."
