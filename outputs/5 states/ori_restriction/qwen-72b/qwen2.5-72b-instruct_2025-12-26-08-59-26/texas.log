  "global_guidance": "New Mexico has the highest average daily inbound flow into Texas (81,177.43) among the four origin states. It also has a relatively high number of infected individuals (I=1,907) and exposed individuals (E=9,918). The expected imported infections from New Mexico can be estimated as 81,177.43 * (1,907 / (877,700 + 9,918 + 1,907 + 15,604 + 33,328 + 227)) 「 16.5. This is significantly higher than the expected imported infections from other states. By reducing the inbound flow from New Mexico by 50%, we can potentially reduce the number of imported infections and slow the spread of the disease in Texas. The trade-off is a moderate disruption in mobility, but the potential reduction in infections justifies this action."
