2025-12-26 09:04:16,129 - virginia - INFO - Parsed PolicyResponse: policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The state of Texas has the highest average daily inbound flow into Virginia (29603.29). Given its relatively high number of infected (I=4591) and exposed (E=2846) individuals, the risk of importing infections is significant. Expected imported infections 「 29603.29 * (4591 / 31195942) 「 4.38 per day. Restricting 50percent of this flow would reduce the expected imported infections to approximately 2.19 per day, significantly lowering the risk of new cases in Virginia. While Arizona, Mississippi, and New Mexico also have some level of infection, their lower inbound flows and fewer infected individuals make them less critical targets for restriction. The trade-off involves a moderate reduction in mobility from Texas, which is justified by the potential reduction in imported infections.'

The expected imported infections from Texas can be estimated as 25924.14 * (14877 / 35374204) 「 1.07 per day. Restricting Texas would reduce this flow by 50%, potentially reducing the import of infections by approximately 0.535 per day over the next 2 weeks. This is the highest risk among the origin states, justifying the temporary travel restriction. While this may cause some mobility disruption, the potential reduction in imported cases and subsequent local transmission is a critical trade-off to minimize the spread of the disease in Virginia."
