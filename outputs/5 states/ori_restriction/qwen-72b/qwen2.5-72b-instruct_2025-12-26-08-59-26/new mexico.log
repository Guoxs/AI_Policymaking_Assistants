2025-12-26 09:04:00,359 - new mexico - INFO - Parsed PolicyResponse: policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Texas has the highest average daily inbound flow into New Mexico (161019.57). It also has a significant number of infected (I) and exposed (E) individuals (I=4591, E=2846). The expected imported infections from Texas can be estimated as 161019.57 * (4591 / 31195942) 「 23.78. This is significantly higher compared to other states. Restricting 50percent of the inbound flow from Texas would reduce the expected imported infections by approximately 11.89, which is the highest reduction possible among the given states. This trade-off between mobility disruption and epidemic control is justified by the high risk of importing infections from Texas.'
