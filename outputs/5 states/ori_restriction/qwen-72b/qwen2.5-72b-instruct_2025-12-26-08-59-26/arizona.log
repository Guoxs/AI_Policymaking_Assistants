  "global_guidance": "Texas has the highest average daily inbound flow into Arizona (50771.93). Additionally, Texas has a significant number of infected individuals (I=14877) and exposed individuals (E=9198), which increases the risk of importing new infections into Arizona. The expected imported infections from Texas can be estimated as 「 50771.93 * (14877 / 35374204) 「 2.12 per day. Restricting 50% of this flow would reduce the expected imported infections by approximately 1.06 per day over the next two weeks, significantly contributing to slowing the spread of the disease in Arizona. This trade-off between mobility disruption and epidemic control is justified given the high risk posed by Texas."
