  "global_guidance": "The selection of Texas as the restricted state is based on the following reasoning: 1. Risk Assessment: Texas has a high number of infected (I=14877) and exposed (E=9198) individuals, posing a significant risk. 2. Quantitative Import Logic: Expected imported infections from Texas 「 35070.57 * (14877 / 35374204) 「 1.46, which is the highest among all origin states. 3. Justification of Selection: Restricting Texas reduces the highest potential influx of infected individuals. 4. Trade-offs: While restricting Texas may disrupt some travel, the reduction in potential infections is crucial for controlling the epidemic in Mississippi."
