The risk assessment shows Texas has a relatively high number of infected individuals (I=4640) and confirmed cases (Q=28461). The expected imported infections from Texas can be estimated as 57282.5 * (4640 / 30199433) 「 8.86. This is significantly higher than the expected imported infections from other states. Restricting travel from Texas would reduce the potential influx of infected individuals, thereby minimizing the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona over the next 2 weeks. The trade-off is a 50percent reduction in inbound travel from Texas, which may cause some mobility disruption, but the health benefits outweigh this cost.'

Texas has the highest number of infected (I) individuals (14,291) and a high average daily inbound flow into Arizona (50,771.93). The expected imported infections from Texas are approximately 50,771.93 * (14,291 / 32,705,761) 「 218. This is significantly higher compared to the other states. Restricting inbound travel from Texas is justified to minimize the potential increase in cases and deaths in Arizona.
