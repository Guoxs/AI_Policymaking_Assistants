The expected imported infections from Texas can be estimated as 25924.14 * (14291 / 32705761) 「 1.11 per day. This is significantly higher compared to the other states. Arizona, Mississippi, and New Mexico have lower inflows and fewer infected individuals, making them less critical. Restricting travel from Texas is justified to minimize the importation of infections while balancing the trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption."
