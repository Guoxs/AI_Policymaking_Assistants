  "global_guidance": "New Mexico is prioritized for restriction due to its high average daily inbound flow (81177.43) and relatively higher infected (I) and exposed (E) populations compared to the other states. The expected imported infections from New Mexico are estimated to be 「 81177.43 * (1466 / 2045543) 「 58.6, which is significantly higher than the expected imports from other states. Restricting New Mexico's inbound flow by 50% would reduce this to 「 29.3, helping to minimize the spread of the disease in Texas. While this restriction will cause some mobility disruption, the trade-off is justified by the potential reduction in imported infections and subsequent cases and deaths in Texas."
