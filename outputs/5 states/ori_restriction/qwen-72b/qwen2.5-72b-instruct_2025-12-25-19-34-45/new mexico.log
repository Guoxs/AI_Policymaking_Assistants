Risk assessment: Texas has the highest number of infected (I) individuals among all origin states, with a significant average daily inbound flow into New Mexico. 2. Quantitative import logic: expected_imported_infections 「 inbound_flow * (I / population) = 142180.07 * (14291 / 32705761) 「 61.2. This is much higher compared to other states. 3. Justification of selection: Restricting Texas would significantly reduce the number of potential imported infections, thereby minimizing the risk of increased cases and deaths in New Mexico. 4. Trade-offs: While restricting Texas might disrupt some travel, the potential health benefits outweigh the mobility disruptions, especially given the high infection rate and large inbound flow from Texas."
