  "global_guidance": "Texas has the highest average daily inbound flow into Mississippi (35070.57) and a relatively high number of infected individuals (I=14097). The expected imported infections from Texas can be estimated as 35070.57 * (14097 / 32392555) 「 1.55 per day. Restricting 50% of the inbound flow from Texas would reduce this to approximately 0.775 per day, significantly lowering the risk of importing new cases. In contrast, Arizona, New Mexico, and Virginia have much lower inbound flows and fewer infected individuals, making them less critical for restriction. This policy balances the need to control the epidemic while minimizing disruption to overall mobility."
