2025-12-25 20:12:41,170 - texas - INFO - Parsed PolicyResponse: policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="New Mexico has the highest average daily inbound flow into Texas (81,177.43) among all origin states. Additionally, New Mexico's current infected (I) and exposed (E) populations are relatively high compared to the other states, with 1,369 infected and 7,098 exposed individuals. The expected imported infections from New Mexico can be estimated as 81,177.43 * (1,369 / (764,937 + 7,098 + 1,369 + 12,691 + 29,528 + 203)) 「 14.4. This is significantly higher than the expected imported infections from other states. By applying a 50percent travel restriction on New Mexico, we can reduce the number of potential imported infections, thereby minimizing the risk of increased cases and deaths in Texas. The trade-off is a 50percent reduction in mobility from New Mexico, which may affect economic and social activities, but this is justified by the higher risk of disease importation."
