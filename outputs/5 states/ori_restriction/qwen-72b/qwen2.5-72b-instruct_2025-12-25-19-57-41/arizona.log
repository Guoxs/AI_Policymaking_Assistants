  "global_guidance": "The state of Texas has the highest average daily inbound flow into Arizona with 50,771.93 people per day. It also has a relatively high number of infected (I) individuals (14,097) and confirmed (Q) cases (77,679). The expected imported infections from Texas can be estimated as 50771.93 * (14097 / 32392555) 「 2.18 per day, which is significantly higher compared to other states. Restricting 50% of the inbound flow from Texas would reduce this risk while causing the least disruption compared to restricting Virginia, which has a much lower average daily inbound flow (4,699.79) and higher infection rates (27,344 I, 196,007 Q). Mississippi and New Mexico have lower inbound flows and fewer infections, making them less critical targets for restriction."
