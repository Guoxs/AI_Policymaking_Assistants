Risk assessment: The origin state with the highest risk is mississippi, based on its high past 14-day averages of I, Q, and D, and its high average daily inbound flow into arizona. The expected imported infections from mississippi are calculated as 「 2069.57 * (9413 / 16254391) 「 11.45, which is a significant contributor to the spread of the disease in arizona.

Quantitative import logic: The expected imported infections from mississippi are calculated as the product of the inbound flow and the ratio of the infected population in mississippi to its total population.

Justification of selection: Based on the risk assessment, selecting mississippi for a temporary inbound travel restriction can potentially slow down the spread of the disease in arizona. The reduction in inbound flow from mississippi will reduce the expected imported infections, which can help minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in arizona.

Trade-offs: Implementing a temporary inbound travel restriction on mississippi may disrupt mobility and cause economic losses, but the potential benefits in reducing the spread of the disease outweigh the costs. The restriction will not eliminate the inbound flow from

  "global_guidance": "The selected origin state, new mexico, has the highest risk of disease spread to arizona based on its past 21-day population composition and daily inbound flow. New mexico has the highest daily inbound flow into arizona among all origin states, which increases the risk of imported infections. Furthermore, new mexico has a higher proportion of exposed and infected individuals in its population. In contrast, the other origin states have lower inbound flows and lower proportions of exposed and infected individuals. A 50% reduction in inbound flow from new mexico is expected to minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in arizona over the full 2-week horizon. This policy may cause some mobility disruption, but it is considered a trade-off necessary to reduce the risk of disease spread."
