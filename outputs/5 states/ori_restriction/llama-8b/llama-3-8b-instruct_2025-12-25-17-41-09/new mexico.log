Virginia has a low number of infected individuals and a low inflow into New Mexico. Texas, on the other hand, has a high number of infected individuals and a high inflow into New Mexico. This suggests that Texas poses a higher risk to New Mexico. 

I use the following quantitative import logic to estimate the expected number of imported infections: expected_imported_infections 「 inbound_flow * (I / population). Based on this calculation, Texas has the highest expected number of imported infections. 

I justify the selection of Texas as the origin state for the temporary inbound travel restriction.

The expected number of imported infections from Texas can be estimated as: 161019.57 * (4851 / 24556928) 「 19.35 infections per day. This is significantly higher than the other origin states. Therefore, imposing a temporary inbound travel restriction from Texas for the next 2 weeks would help minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico. A 50percent reduction in the inbound flow from Texas would lead to a reduction of approximately 8030.785 imported infections over the next 14 days. This trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption is acceptable, given the significant potential for disease spread from Texas.'

Justification of selection: restricting inbound travel from Texas is expected to reduce the number of imported infections, thereby minimizing the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the full 2-week horizon. Trade-offs: restricting inbound travel from Texas may disrupt mobility and potentially impact the economy, but it is a necessary measure to control the spread of the disease."
