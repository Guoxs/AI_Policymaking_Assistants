Arizona has a moderate risk level, with a relatively high number of infected individuals (1077) and confirmed cases (21422) compared to its population. New Mexico has a low risk level due to its small number of infected individuals (302) and confirmed cases (3196). Virginia has a moderate risk level, with a relatively high number of infected individuals (4453) and confirmed cases (25200). Texas, on the other hand, has a high risk level, with a large number of infected individuals (5932) and confirmed cases (36931), as well as a significant inbound flow into Mississippi. Therefore, we recommend applying a temporary inbound travel restriction to Texas, which is expected to reduce the number of imported infections and slow down the spread of the disease in Mississippi. This restriction is expected to reduce the inbound flow from Texas by 50%, which is estimated to be 35544.86 people. This trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption is justified by the potential reduction in cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over

  "global_guidance": "Based on the given data, we assess the risk of each origin state using SEIQRD indicators. Arizona has a relatively high number of infected individuals and a moderate inflow to Mississippi, while New Mexico has a low number of infected individuals and a low inflow. Virginia has a moderate number of infected individuals and a moderate inflow. Texas, on the other hand, has a high number of infected individuals and a high inflow. Given the high inflow and high number of infected individuals, Texas is prioritized for a temporary inbound travel restriction to minimize the spread of the disease. Expected imported infections 「 inbound flow * (I / population) 「 35070.57 * (7877 / 15274695) 「 11.45. By restricting 50% of the inflow from Texas, we can reduce the expected imported infections by 「 5.73. This trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption is favorable, as it allows for a reduction in the spread of the disease while minimizing the disruption of mobility."
