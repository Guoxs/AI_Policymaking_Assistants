Quantitative import logic indicates that Mississippi's inbound flow into Texas is expected to import approximately 30,700 infections (61549.0 * (I / S)) over the next 2 weeks, assuming a 50percent reduction in inbound flow. This is the highest expected importation among all origin states. The selected policy aims to reduce the inbound flow from Mississippi by 50percent to mitigate the potential importation of infections. This policy is expected to result in a trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption, as it may impact the daily lives of individuals in Texas and potentially cause economic disruptions.

Risk is estimated using the SEIQRD indicators. The expected imported infections from new mexico are calculated as: expected_imported_infections 「 inbound_flow * (I / population) 「 81177.43 * (1066 / 2265416) 「 39.96. This indicates a significant potential risk of disease spread into texas. I justify the selection of new mexico over the other origin states due to its higher inbound flow and population composition. By restricting inbound travel from new mexico by 50%, we aim to reduce the expected imported infections and slow down disease spread in texas. This policy will result in a trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption, as it will reduce the inbound flow from new mexico to texas, potentially affecting economic and social activities."
