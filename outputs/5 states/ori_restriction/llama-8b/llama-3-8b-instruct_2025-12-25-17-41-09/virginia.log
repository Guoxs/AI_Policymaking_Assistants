The expected imported infections 「 inbound_flow * (I / population), and Texas' inbound flow (25924.14) is the highest among the four origin states. This suggests a higher potential for imported cases. Additionally, the 50percent reduction in inbound flow from Texas will minimize the disruption to mobility. However, this policy may lead to a trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption. By restricting inbound flow from Texas, we prioritize controlling the spread of the disease in Virginia, but this may cause inconvenience to commuters and disrupt the state's economy."
