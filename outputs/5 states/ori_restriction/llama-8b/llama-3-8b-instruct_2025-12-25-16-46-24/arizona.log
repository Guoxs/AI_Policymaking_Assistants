This is a significant number of potential infections. In contrast, the other origin states have relatively lower proportions of infected individuals. New Mexico has the next highest proportion of infected individuals, but its inbound flow is much lower. Texas and Virginia have even lower proportions of infected individuals. Considering the 50% reduction in inbound flow, the expected reduction in imported infections from Mississippi would be substantial, justifying the selection of Mississippi as the origin state for the temporary inbound travel restriction. The trade-off is a reduction in mobility, which may affect other aspects of life in Arizona, but the potential reduction in imported infections and subsequent epidemic

Risk assessment: Based on SEIQRD indicators, mississippi has the highest proportion of infected individuals (35981/987381) among origin states, indicating a higher risk of disease transmission. Additionally, its past 14-day average daily inbound flow into arizona (2401) is relatively high.

Quantitative import logic: Assuming an expected imported infection rate of inbound flow * (I / population) = 2401 * (35981 / 987381) 「 23.44 infections, which is significant considering the current arizona population.

Justification of selection: Restricting inbound travel from mississippi is justified due to its higher risk of disease transmission and potential to introduce a large number of infected individuals into arizona. This is expected to reduce the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in arizona over the 2-week horizon.

Trade-offs: Implementing this restriction may disrupt mobility and potentially affect economic activities, but it is a necessary measure to mitigate the spread of the disease. By reducing the inbound flow from mississippi, we aim to minimize the number of new infections and deaths in arizona, ultimately saving lives and

Additionally, the past 14-day average daily inbound flow into arizona from mississippi is 1973.71, which is substantial. I expect a significant portion of these individuals to be infected, given the high number of infected and confirmed cases in mississippi. Reducing the inbound flow from mississippi by 50% is expected to reduce the number of new infections in arizona. While this restriction will disrupt mobility, it is a necessary measure to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in arizona. The quantitative import logic suggests that the expected number of imported infections is approximately equal to the inbound flow multiplied by the ratio of infected individuals to the population in mississippi. This calculation indicates that restricting the inbound flow from mississippi will lead to a substantial reduction in new infections in arizona.

  "global_guidance": "Based on the risk assessment, I prioritize origin state Mississippi due to its relatively high infection rate (I / population) and high inbound flow into Arizona. Risk assessment indicates that Mississippi has a higher likelihood of importing infections to Arizona. The expected imported infections 「 inbound_flow * (I / population) 「 1677.14 * (159474 / 298989) 「 103.67. This suggests that Mississippi is a high-risk origin state. Additionally, considering the trade-offs between epidemic control and mobility disruption, a 50% reduction in inbound flow from Mississippi is a reasonable measure to slow disease spread in Arizona. By restricting inbound travel from Mississippi, we can potentially reduce the number of imported infections and mitigate the spread of the disease in Arizona."
