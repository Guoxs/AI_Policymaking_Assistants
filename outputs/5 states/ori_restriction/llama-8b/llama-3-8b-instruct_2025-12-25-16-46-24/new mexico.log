Arizona has a relatively high infected population, while Mississippi has a higher exposed population. Texas has a significantly higher confirmed population, indicating a higher risk of disease spread. Virginia has a relatively low risk. The expected imported infections from Texas are higher due to its larger population and confirmed cases. A 50% reduction in inbound flow from Texas to New Mexico is expected to reduce the spread of the disease. Considering the trade-offs between epidemic control and mobility disruption, we recommend restricting inbound travel from Texas to New Mexico for the next two weeks."

I use the SEIQRD indicators to assess the risk of each state: Texas has a higher number of infected individuals (I=4504) and a higher past 14-day average daily inflow into New Mexico. I apply a quantitative import logic model, assuming the expected number of imported infections is approximately equal to the inbound flow times the proportion of infected individuals in the origin state. The expected number of imported infections from Texas is approximately 161019.57 * (4504 / 24532735) 「 28. Expected imported infections from the other three origin states are significantly lower. The justification for selecting Texas is based on the combination of its high inbound flow and high number of infected individuals. This policy aims to reduce the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks. The trade-offs between epidemic control and mobility disruption are that restricting inbound travel from Texas may

According to the SEIR model, the expected imported infections from Texas can be estimated as inbound_flow * (I / population). With a high average daily inflow and a relatively high proportion of infected individuals in Texas, this restriction is expected to reduce the number of new cases in New Mexico. Furthermore, considering the trade-offs between epidemic control and mobility disruption, the reduction in inbound flow from Texas is expected to have a more significant impact on the spread of the disease than the other origin states. Therefore, I recommend a 50% reduction in inbound flow from Texas to New Mexico for the next two weeks."

Texas has the highest number of infected individuals (I = 23989) and a relatively high inflow into New Mexico (151752.0). This suggests a higher risk of imported infections. I quantify the expected imported infections using the model: expected_imported_infections 「 inbound_flow * (I / population). For Texas, this translates to approximately 93.5 infections. In contrast, Arizona and Mississippi have lower inflows and fewer infected individuals, while Virginia has a relatively low inflow and no notable infected individuals.
