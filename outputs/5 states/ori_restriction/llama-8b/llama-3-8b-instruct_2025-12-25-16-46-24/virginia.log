This, combined with the low number of recovered individuals (223633) and low number of deaths (6011), indicates a higher potential for imported infections. The risk assessment is based on the SEIQRD indicators of the origin state. The expected imported infections are calculated as inbound_flow * (I / population). This calculation shows that Mississippi has a higher expected importation rate compared to the other origin states. The restriction will reduce the inbound flow from Mississippi by 50%, which will minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two weeks.
