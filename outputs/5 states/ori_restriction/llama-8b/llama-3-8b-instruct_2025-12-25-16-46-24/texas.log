The expected importation risk is estimated based on the past 21-day inflow and population composition of Mississippi. The risk assessment is as follows: Mississippi has a higher average daily inflow into Texas (5486976) and a higher number of infected individuals (I) compared to Arizona and New Mexico, which increases the risk of imported infections. Virginia has a lower average daily inflow into Texas and fewer infected individuals, making it a lower priority for restriction.

The expected imported infections from mississippi are calculated as approximately inbound_flow * (I / population) 「 38148.21 * (34385 / 2993609) 「 42.45. This is higher than the other origin states. A 50percent reduction in inbound flow from mississippi is expected to lead to a significant reduction in imported infections. However, this restriction will also lead to a 50percent reduction in inbound flow from mississippi, which may have a negative impact on the economy and other aspects of mobility.

  "global_guidance": "The origin state with the highest risk of importing infections is Mississippi, based on its past 21-day population composition. The average number of infected individuals (I) is 159474, which is significantly higher than other origin states. Additionally, the average daily inbound flow from Mississippi to Texas is 24465, which is also higher than other origin states. To minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas, a temporary inbound travel restriction from Mississippi is recommended. This restriction will reduce the inbound flow from Mississippi to Texas by 50% for the next two weeks, which is expected to reduce the importation of infections. This policy trade-off is justified as it prioritizes epidemic control over mobility disruption, considering the higher risk of infection importation from Mississippi."
