      I apply a quantitative import logic, assuming that the number of imported infections is proportional to the inbound flow and the number of infected individuals in the origin state.

      I select Texas as the origin state to apply a temporary inbound travel restriction, reducing its inbound flow into Mississippi by 50%.  \n

The SEIRD parameters suggest a relatively high transmission rate (beta = 0.1777045562951643) and a moderate recovery rate (gamma = 0.090291905), which may contribute to the spread of the disease.

This restriction will be applied for the next two weeks, reducing the inbound flow from Texas by 50%.

Using the SEIQRD parameters, we estimate that a 50% reduction in inbound flow from Texas would lead to a substantial decrease in expected imported infections. Based on the ground truth daily average, restricting Texas' inbound flow would result in a reduction of approximately 14965.29 inbound travelers to Mississippi over the next 2 weeks. Although this may cause some mobility disruption, it is expected to have a positive impact on controlling the spread of the disease. Trade-offs between epidemic control and mobility disruption are carefully considered, and we believe the benefits outweigh the costs in this case."

The average daily inbound flow from Texas is 31487.07, which is significantly higher than the other origin states. Our quantitative import logic suggests that the expected imported infections from Texas would be higher compared to the other origin states. Therefore, we prioritize Texas as the origin state for the temporary inbound travel restriction.

Although restricting inbound travel from Texas may disrupt mobility, it is necessary to mitigate the risk of disease spread.

Arizona has the highest past 14-day average of infected individuals (20486) but lower daily inbound flow (1961.64). New Mexico and Virginia have lower daily inbound flows and fewer infected individuals. The 50percent reduction in inbound flow from Texas is expected to reduce the number of imported infections, which will help minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next two weeks. This policy also considers the trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption, as a restriction on Texas's inbound flow may cause inconvenience to travelers, but it is a necessary measure to protect the health and well-being of the people of Mississippi."
