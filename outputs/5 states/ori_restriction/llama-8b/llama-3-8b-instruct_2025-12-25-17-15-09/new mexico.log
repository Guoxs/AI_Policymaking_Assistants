Arizona has the highest number of infected individuals (763) and confirmed cases (15613) among the origin states, which increases the risk of imported infections. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections from Arizona can be estimated as approximately 147 infections (29481.29 * 0.5 * (763 / 12125361)) over the next 2 weeks. This is significantly higher than the expected imported infections from other origin states. Therefore, I prioritize Arizona as the origin state for the temporary inbound travel restriction. The restriction will reduce the inbound flow from Arizona into New Mexico by 50%, which is expected to slow down the spread of the disease in New Mexico. Although this restriction may cause some mobility disruption, it is justified by the potential risk reduction. Trade-offs between epidemic control and mobility disruption are carefully considered, and the restriction is expected to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next 2 weeks."

  "global_guidance": "Based on the given information, I assess the risk of each origin state by analyzing their SEIQRD indicators. Texas has the highest number of confirmed cases (Q=105385), followed by Arizona and Virginia. Mississippi has a relatively low number of confirmed cases. In terms of daily inbound flow, Texas has the highest flow (142180.07), followed by Arizona and then Virginia. Mississippi has the lowest flow. Given the quantitative import logic, I estimate that Texas has the highest expected imported infections (expected_imported_infections 「 inbound_flow * (I / population)). Therefore, I recommend restricting the inbound flow from Texas to New Mexico by 50% to minimize the spread of the disease. This restriction is expected to reduce the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the 2-week horizon. However, this policy also restricts mobility, which may have a negative impact on the economy and daily life. The trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption is a critical consideration in this decision."
