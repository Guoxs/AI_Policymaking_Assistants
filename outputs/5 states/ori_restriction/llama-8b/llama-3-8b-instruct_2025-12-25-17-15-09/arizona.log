Its past 14-day averages of I, Q, R, and D also indicate a higher level of transmission. Applying a 50% reduction to its inbound flow into Arizona is expected to minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona.\n\nNew Mexico has a smaller number of infected individuals (202) and inbound flow (3611569) compared to Mississippi. Texas has a larger population but a relatively small inbound flow into Arizona. Virginia has a relatively small population and inbound flow. \n\nThe quantitative import logic used is: expected_imported_infections 「 inbound_flow * (I / population). Based on this, we expect a significant reduction in imported infections from Mississippi compared to the other origin states. \n\nThe selection of Mississippi as the restricted state is justified by its high risk indicators and expected high impact on reducing the spread of the disease in Arizona

  "global_guidance": "The origin state with the highest risk of imported infections is Mississippi, given its relatively high number of infected individuals and its high inbound flow into Arizona. Our risk assessment is based on the ratio of infected individuals to the total population, as well as the average daily inbound flow. Specifically, the risk assessment formula is: RISK = (I / S) * INFLow. Mississippi's risk score is significantly higher than that of the other origin states. By restricting inbound travel from Mississippi, we expect to reduce the number of imported infections and subsequently minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona. The 50% reduction in inbound flow will have a minimal impact on Arizona's economy and daily life, considering the current pandemic situation. This trade-off is justified, as the potential reduction in infections and deaths outweighs the potential disruption to mobility."
