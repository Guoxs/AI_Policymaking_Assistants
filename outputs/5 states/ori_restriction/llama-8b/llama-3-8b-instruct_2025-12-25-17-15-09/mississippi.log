Risk assessment: Based on the given SEIQRD indicators, Texas has the highest number of infected individuals (I=1252), which increases the risk of imported infections. New Mexico has the highest number of exposed individuals (E=693), which could indicate a potential outbreak. Arizona has a high average daily inflow into Mississippi (11371640), but its population composition suggests a relatively low risk of infections.
Quantitative import logic: Assuming the expected_imported_infections 「 inbound_flow * (I / population), we can estimate the expected number of imported infections from Texas as 26508.14 * (1252 / 28626024) 「 10.34. This is significantly higher than the estimated imports from other origin states.
Justification of selection: Given the high risk of imported infections from Texas, imposing a 50% reduction on the inbound flow from Texas is justified to minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the full 2-week horizon.
Trade-offs: By imposing this restriction, we may disrupt inbound travel and potentially affect the economy, but the reduction in imported infections is expected to lead to

Therefore, a 50percent reduction in inbound flow from Texas to Mississippi is recommended to minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi. This policy aims to balance epidemic control with mobility disruption, as the reduction is targeted at a high-risk origin state with a significant inflow. The reduced inbound flow from Texas will be reallocated to other destination states according to the baseline mobility structure of Texas.'

  "global_guidance": "Based on risk assessment, we prioritize Texas due to its high number of infected individuals (I=19318) and relatively large population (S=19471427). The quantitative import logic suggests that Texas has the highest potential to import infections to Mississippi. We expect imported infections 「 29930.57 * (19318 / 19471427) 「 148.5. This is higher than the other origin states. Justification of selection: While Arizona and New Mexico have higher exposed (E) and infected (I) populations, their average daily inbound flows are lower. Virginia has a higher number of infected individuals, but its average daily inbound flow is relatively low. Trade-offs: Implementing a restriction on Texas may result in a 50% reduction of its inbound flow, which could potentially disrupt mobility. However, this reduction is expected to minimize the number of imported infections to Mississippi, ultimately reducing the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths."
