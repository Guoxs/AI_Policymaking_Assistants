Mississippi has the highest E/I ratio, indicating a high risk of disease spread. Therefore, it is recommended to impose a temporary inbound travel restriction on Mississippi to reduce the risk of disease spread to Virginia. The reduction factor is fixed at 0.5, which means the inbound flow from Mississippi would be reduced by 50%.

The expected imported infections from Mississippi can be estimated as inbound_flow * (I / population). With a 50% reduction in inbound flow, the expected reduced imported infections will be 2,128.95. This reduction is expected to minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two weeks. Although Arizona has a higher number of infected individuals, its inbound flow into Virginia is much lower compared to Mississippi. New Mexico and Texas have relatively low numbers of infected individuals and inbound flows. Therefore, a temporary inbound travel restriction from Mississippi is recommended to slow down the disease spread in Virginia. This policy will also minimize the trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption."
