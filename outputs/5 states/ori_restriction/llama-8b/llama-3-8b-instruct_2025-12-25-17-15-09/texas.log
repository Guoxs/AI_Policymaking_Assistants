This increased flow poses a higher risk of imported infections. The expected imported infections calculated using the 14-day average daily inbound flow and the infected population of new mexico is 「 6.86 (69252.07 * (1276 / 2093484)). This is higher compared to the other origin states. Therefore, a temporary inbound travel restriction is recommended to reduce the potential spread of the disease. The restriction will reduce the inbound flow from new mexico by 50%, minimizing the risk of imported infections.

I calculate the expected imported infections using the inbound flow and the number of infected individuals in each origin state. This suggests that Mississippi has the highest expected importation rate. Additionally, Mississippi has a relatively high number of susceptible individuals, which increases the potential for further transmission. Considering these factors, I recommend restricting inbound travel from Mississippi by 50% to minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas over the next two weeks. This policy aims to reduce the expected imported infections and contain the spread of the disease, while also minimizing mobility disruption.
