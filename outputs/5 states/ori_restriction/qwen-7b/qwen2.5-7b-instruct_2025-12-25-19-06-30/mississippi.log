The expected imported infections from Texas can be calculated as 'expected_imported_infections 「 inbound_flow * (I / population)', which results in approximately 10.5 per day. Given the significant inbound flow from Texas (Inflow = 37146.64), this represents a substantial risk of disease spread into Mississippi. New Mexico and Virginia also have inbound flows, but their infection rates are lower. Arizona has a slightly higher inbound flow but its infection rate is not as high as Texas's. Therefore, applying a temporary travel restriction to Texas would likely have the greatest impact in slowing down the disease spread in Mississippi. This intervention comes with the trade-off of reducing mobility from a state with a large population, but it is justified by the higher risk posed by Texas's current epidemic situation."

  "global_guidance": "Based on the SEIQRD indicators, Texas presents the highest risk with a significant number of infected individuals and a high daily inbound flow into Mississippi. Expected imported infections from Texas are calculated as 'inbound_flow * (I / population)', which results in approximately 6.5 imported infections per day. New Mexico and Virginia also have higher flows, but their infection rates are lower compared to Texas. Arizona has a much smaller flow into Mississippi. Therefore, restricting inbound travel from Texas would likely have the greatest impact on slowing the disease spread in Mississippi. This intervention would disrupt 50% of the expected 35,070.57 daily inbound flow, reducing the influx of infected individuals. However, the trade-off is that it might cause some inconvenience to travelers from Texas, and the reduced flow could potentially be reallocated to other states, which might still pose a risk. Overall, this policy aims to mitigate the largest potential source of new infections in the next two weeks."
