  "global_guidance": "Based on the SEIQRD indicators, New Mexico presents a higher risk with a larger number of infected individuals (I = 2023) compared to Arizona, Mississippi, and Virginia. The expected imported infections from New Mexico can be calculated as inbound_flow * (I / population). For New Mexico, this value is approximately 81177.43 * (2023 / 1370142) = 1.22. For Arizona, it is 44788.29 * (11654 / 6737235) = 0.71; for Mississippi, it is 33442.71 * (40 / 32196) = 4.17; and for Virginia, it is 20566.29 * (19960 / 5494123) = 0.73. Given these calculations, New Mexico has the highest potential for importing infections into Texas. By reducing its inbound flow by 50%, we can significantly lower the risk of disease spread in Texas. This intervention strikes a balance between effective epidemic control and minimal disruption to mobility, as New Mexico's reduced contribution will still allow some level of travel, albeit at a lower rate."
