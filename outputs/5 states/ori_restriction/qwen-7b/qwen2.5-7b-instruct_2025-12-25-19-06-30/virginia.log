Given the significantly higher influx of travelers from Texas (inflow = 29603.29), this state poses a substantial threat to Virginia's epidemic control. By reducing inbound travel from Texas by 50percent, we can mitigate the risk of importing new infections, thereby helping to slow down the disease spread in Virginia. This intervention strikes a balance between effective epidemic control and minimal disruption to mobility, as it leverages the high baseline mobility and infection rates from Texas without overly restricting overall movement."
