  "global_guidance": "Based on the SEIQRD indicators, Texas presents the highest risk with a significant number of infected individuals (I = 11479) and confirmed cases (Q = 65447). The expected imported infections from Texas can be calculated as expected_imported_infections 「 inbound_flow * (I / population), which results in approximately 10,218 imported infections over the next two weeks. This is substantially higher than the contributions from Arizona, Mississippi, and Virginia. Therefore, applying a temporary inbound travel restriction from Texas would likely have the most substantial impact on slowing the disease spread in New Mexico. While this policy disrupts mobility, it is justified by the high risk and significant potential for disease transmission from Texas to New Mexico."
