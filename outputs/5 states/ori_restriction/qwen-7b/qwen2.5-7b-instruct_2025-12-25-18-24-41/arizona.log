2025-12-25 18:28:57,993 - arizona - INFO - Parsed PolicyResponse: policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Based on the SEIQRD indicators, Texas presents the highest risk with a large number of infected individuals (I = 5717) and a significant average daily inbound flow into Arizona (57282.5). The expected imported infections from Texas can be calculated as 'expected_imported_infections 「 inbound_flow * (I / population)', which results in approximately 0.000102 imported infections per day. Given the high baseline inbound flow and the substantial number of active infections, restricting inbound travel from Texas would likely have a meaningful impact on slowing the disease spread in Arizona. While New Mexico and Virginia also have higher inbound flows, the risk assessment indicates that Texas poses the greatest threat due to its higher infection rate. The trade-off involves disrupting 50percent of the inbound flow from Texas, which could lead to increased local transmission if not controlled, but the potential reduction in imported cases justifies this action."

  "global_guidance": "Based on the current SEIRD indicators, Texas presents the highest risk with a significant number of infected individuals (I = 11479) and a high daily inbound flow into Arizona (50771.93). The expected imported infections from Texas can be calculated as 'expected_imported_infections 「 inbound_flow * (I / population)', which results in approximately 0.00035 infections per day. Given the large influx of people from Texas, a 50% reduction in inbound travel would significantly mitigate the risk of disease spread into Arizona. While New Mexico and Virginia also have higher inbound flows, the sheer volume from Texas makes it the primary concern. Implementing this restriction will help reduce the strain on Arizona's healthcare system and lower the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths over the next two weeks, albeit with some disruption to mobility."
