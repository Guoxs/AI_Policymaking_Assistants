We estimate the expected imported infections by considering each origin state's inbound flow to Mississippi multiplied by its average 'Infected' population (I) as a proportion of its total population (S+E+I+Q+R+D). 
Arizona: Expected imported infections 「 1430.71 * (185 / 7470535) 「 0.035.

Texas stands out with a significantly higher baseline inbound flow to Mississippi and, consequently, the highest estimated imported infections. Restricting travel from Texas, despite the mobility disruption, offers the most substantial reduction in potential imported cases. A 50% reduction in inbound flow from Texas would cut the expected imported infections from this source by half, from approximately 1.13 to 0.56. While this entails a notable mobility disruption due to Texas's large baseline flow, the epidemiological benefit of reducing the primary source of external infection pressure outweighs the disruption compared to restricting other states with lower estimated import risks. Therefore, prioritizing Texas for a temporary inbound travel restriction is the most effective strategy to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next two weeks."

Arizona has a moderate I/Pop ratio (373/8.3M) and a baseline inflow of 2004.64. New Mexico has a low I/Pop ratio (111/1.4M) and a baseline inflow of 1369.21.

Texas, however, presents the highest risk due to its significant infected population (2322/26.2M) and, crucially, the largest baseline daily inbound flow into Mississippi (39453.07). 
The quantitative import logic estimates potential imported infections by considering the infected proportion of the origin state's population and its inbound flow. While Texas's I/Pop ratio is not the highest, its sheer volume of inbound travelers means that even a moderate I/Pop ratio translates to a substantially higher number of potential imported cases compared to other states. For example, Texas's potential infected import is approximately 39453 * (2322 / 26195198) 「 3.5 people per day, compared to Arizona's 2004 * (373 / 8334876) 「 0.09 people per day, or Virginia's 4303 * (1616 / 9858198) 「 0.7 people per day.

Texas, with its significantly higher baseline inbound flow (42422.64) compared to other states, presents the largest potential for infection import. Although Virginia has a higher estimated I/Pop ratio (0.0038 vs 0.0024 for Texas), the sheer volume of travelers from Texas makes its absolute contribution to imported infections substantially larger (approx. 101.8 from Texas vs 17.8 from Virginia). Restricting Texas by 50% is projected to yield the most significant reduction in imported infections, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi. While this intervention disrupts mobility from Texas, the trade-off is justified by the substantial public health benefit of reducing disease spread within Mississippi, outweighing the impact of restricting smaller flows from other states or no restriction at all."

  "global_guidance": "Our risk assessment for the next two weeks prioritizes minimizing imported infections and subsequent cases/deaths in Mississippi. We evaluated each origin state based on its current infection prevalence and its baseline inbound flow to Mississippi. Texas, despite having a moderate infection rate (I/Pop 「 0.0026), presents the highest quantitative import risk due to its significantly larger baseline inbound flow of 35070.57. Applying the expected imported infections model (I/Pop * Inflow), Texas contributes an estimated 91.18 potential infections daily, far exceeding Arizona (0.0019 * 1961.64 = 3.73), New Mexico (0.0022 * 1070 = 2.35), and Virginia (0.0044 * 3897.79 = 17.15). Restricting Texas by 50% is projected to reduce daily imported infections by approximately 45.59, offering the most substantial reduction in disease spread. While this entails a significant mobility disruption of over 17,500 daily travelers from Texas, the trade-off is justified by the potential for a considerable decrease in new cases and deaths in Mississippi, outweighing the smaller benefits from restricting other states or no restriction at all."
