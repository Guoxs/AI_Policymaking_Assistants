Mississippi exhibits the highest internal prevalence of (I+E) per capita at approximately 0.16%, followed by Virginia (0.058%) and Arizona (0.041%), while Texas has the lowest at 0.007%. To quantify imported risk, we use the model: expected_imported_infections = baseline_inflow * ((I + E) / total_population). This yields daily imported (I+E) estimates of ~8.0 from Arizona, ~2.8 from Mississippi, ~8.9 from Texas, and ~0.7 from Virginia.

Texas, with a population of 27,484,241 and 1,644 infected individuals, has an infected ratio of approximately 0.0000598.

Mississippi shows a much higher infection prevalence (I/Pop \u2248 0.002088) and exposure prevalence (E/Pop \u2248 0.004368), suggesting a more active epidemic locally, but its inbound flow to New Mexico is very low (1902.57).

Therefore, a 50% restriction on Texas's inbound flow is estimated to reduce daily imported infections by about 9.92, totaling approximately 139 infections over the two-week horizon. This substantial reduction in potential new cases justifies prioritizing Texas over other states. While a restriction on Texas would disrupt a significant volume of daily travel (over 80,000 people), the primary objective is to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico. The magnitude of infection reduction from restricting Texas far outweighs the impact from other states, making it the most effective intervention for epidemic control, even with the associated mobility trade-offs."

  "global_guidance": "Intervention reasoning: Risk assessment of origin states reveals varying levels of active infections (I) and total population. Mississippi has the highest I/Pop ratio (63469/2027535 = 3.13%), followed by Arizona (2812/10851667 = 0.026%), Texas (18965/21402207 = 0.089%), and Virginia (11952/14193264 = 0.084%). Quantitative import logic: Expected imported infections are estimated by multiplying the baseline inbound flow by the origin state's (I / Population) ratio. For Texas, the baseline flow is 148426.79, and I/Pop is 0.000886, leading to an estimated 131.5 imported infections daily. For Arizona, flow is 27662.29, I/Pop is 0.000259, yielding 7.17 daily imported infections. For Mississippi, flow is 1312.14, I/Pop is 0.0313, yielding 41.09 daily imported infections. For Virginia, flow is 1403.14, I/Pop is 0.000842, yielding 1.18 daily imported infections. Justification of selection: Texas, despite having a lower I/Pop ratio than Mississippi, has by far the largest baseline inbound flow into New Mexico. This translates to the highest absolute number of potential daily imported infections (131.5) compared to Mississippi (41.09), Arizona (7.17), and Virginia (1.18). Prioritizing Texas for restriction will therefore have the most significant impact on reducing the overall inflow of infected individuals into New Mexico. Trade-offs: Restricting Texas will lead to the largest mobility disruption due to its high baseline flow, but this disruption is deemed necessary to mitigate the highest potential source of disease importation and minimize cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico."

2025-12-25 15:36:57,313 - new mexico - INFO - Parsed PolicyResponse: policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Intervention reasoning: Risk assessment of origin states reveals varying levels of active infections (I) and total population. Mississippi has the highest I/Pop ratio (63469/2027535 = 3.13percent), followed by Arizona (2812/10851667 = 0.026percent), Texas (18965/21402207 = 0.089percent), and Virginia (11952/14193264 = 0.084percent). Quantitative import logic: Expected imported infections are estimated by multiplying the baseline inbound flow by the origin state's (I / Population) ratio. For Texas, the baseline flow is 148426.79, and I/Pop is 0.000886, leading to an estimated 131.5 imported infections daily. For Arizona, flow is 27662.29, I/Pop is 0.000259, yielding 7.17 daily imported infections. For Mississippi, flow is 1312.14, I/Pop is 0.0313, yielding 41.09 daily imported infections. For Virginia, flow is 1403.14, I/Pop is 0.000842, yielding 1.18 daily imported infections. Justification of selection: Texas, despite having a lower I/Pop ratio than Mississippi, has by far the largest baseline inbound flow into New Mexico. This translates to the highest absolute number of potential daily imported infections (131.5) compared to Mississippi (41.09), Arizona (7.17), and Virginia (1.18). Prioritizing Texas for restriction will therefore have the most significant impact on reducing the overall inflow of infected individuals into New Mexico. Trade-offs: Restricting Texas will lead to the largest mobility disruption due to its high baseline flow, but this disruption is deemed necessary to mitigate the highest potential source of disease importation and minimize cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico."

Justification of selection: 'texas' is prioritized due to its substantially higher baseline inbound flow into New Mexico combined with a considerable number of infected individuals, leading to the highest projected daily imported infections. Restricting 'texas' is expected to have the most significant impact on reducing the influx of infected individuals into New Mexico. Trade-offs: While restricting 'texas' will cause the largest mobility disruption due to its high baseline flow, this disruption is deemed necessary to mitigate the higher risk of disease transmission and minimize cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico.
