Using the quantitative import logic (expected_imported_infections 「 inbound_flow * (I + E / population)), New Mexico is projected to contribute about 25.76 potential infections daily.

For comparison, restricting Texas, despite its higher inbound flow, would yield minimal epidemiological benefit due to its very low prevalence.

We calculated the expected daily imported infections for each state by multiplying their baseline inbound flow to Arizona by their current 'Infected' (I) prevalence (I / Total Population). 1. Mississippi: High I prevalence (0.00324) but low flow, resulting in ~8.36 expected daily imported infections. 2. New Mexico: Moderate I prevalence (0.000213) and high flow, leading to ~9.13 expected daily imported infections. 3.

Virginia: Moderate I prevalence (0.000220) but very low flow, leading to ~1.43 expected daily imported infections. Texas exhibits the highest number of expected daily imported infections. Therefore, a 50% reduction in inbound flow from Texas is projected to yield the largest absolute reduction in imported infections (approximately 4.64 fewer infected individuals per day) compared to restricting any other state.

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona over the next two weeks, a temporary inbound travel restriction is recommended for Texas. A risk assessment of all origin states was conducted by calculating the 'Infected Population Ratio' (I/Total Population) and 'Infection Import Potential' (Inbound Flow * I/Total Population). Texas presents the highest potential for importing infections due to its significant baseline inbound flow into Arizona (43017.86 daily) combined with a moderately high infected population ratio (0.0029). While Mississippi has a very high infected population ratio (0.13), its inbound flow is significantly lower (2067.29), resulting in a lower overall import potential. New Mexico has a high inbound flow, but a very low infected population ratio. Virginia has a moderate infected population ratio but a relatively low inbound flow. Therefore, restricting Texas's inbound flow by 50% is projected to yield the most substantial reduction in imported infections, providing the best trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption by targeting the largest source of potential infection import."

Texas, with a population of approximately 17 million, has a high number of active infections (I=37517) and a significant exposed population (E=22097). More critically, Texas contributes the largest baseline inbound flow to Arizona (58865.79 daily). While Virginia has a higher E count, its I count is comparable to Texas, and its inbound flow is significantly lower. Mississippi has a high I count relative to its population but a very small inbound flow. New Mexico has very low I and E counts. Quantitatively, the estimated imported infections from Texas are highest due to its large flow and substantial infected population. A 50% reduction in inbound flow from Texas is projected to yield the most significant reduction in imported cases, thereby mitigating the spread of disease in Arizona. The trade-off involves disrupting a large volume of travel from Texas, but this is deemed necessary given the potential for significant health benefits by reducing disease importation from the highest-risk and highest-volume origin state."
