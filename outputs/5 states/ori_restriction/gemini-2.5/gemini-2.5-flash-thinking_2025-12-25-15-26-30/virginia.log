To quantify potential import risk, we calculated 'expected imported infections' by multiplying the baseline inbound flow by the ratio of infected individuals (I) to the total population (S+E+I+Q+R+D) for each state. Texas, despite having a lower I/Population ratio than Mississippi, presents the highest absolute risk due to its significantly larger baseline inbound flow into Virginia (29603.29 daily vs. Mississippi's 5602.43).

While its I/Pop ratio is not the highest, the sheer volume of travel makes it the largest contributor to potential imported cases.
