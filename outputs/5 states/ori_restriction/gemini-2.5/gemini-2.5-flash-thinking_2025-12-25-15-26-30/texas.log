Quantitative import logic: The potential for imported infections into Texas is estimated by multiplying each state's baseline daily inbound flow by its active case prevalence ((I+Q)/Population). This yields estimated daily imported infections of 16.0 from Arizona, 44.1 from Mississippi, 73.8 from New Mexico, and 14.4 from Virginia. 3. Justification of selection: New Mexico is prioritized for restriction because it accounts for the largest share of potential imported infections due to its significant inbound travel volume to Texas (69252.07 daily) despite having a moderate prevalence. A 50% restriction on New Mexico's inbound flow is projected to reduce imported infections by approximately 36.9 daily, which is the most impactful reduction compared to other states (e.g., Mississippi: 22.0; Arizona: 8.0; Virginia: 7.2). 4. Trade-offs: While restricting New Mexico will cause mobility disruption, this measure is justified by its potential to significantly mitigate disease spread in Texas, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths over the next two weeks, outweighing the localized travel inconvenience."

New Mexico, despite having a relatively low 'I/Pop' ratio, presents the highest expected imported infections due to its significantly larger baseline inbound flow into Texas (124,904.21 daily). Its calculated imported infection risk is approximately 124,904 * (124 / 357,840) = 43.2. While Mississippi has a higher infection rate, its inbound flow to Texas is considerably lower (62,465 daily), resulting in an imported infection risk of 62,465 * (21,814 / 3,715,090) = 366.8. However, the population figures provided for Mississippi (S=3.7M, I=21k, Q=11k) suggest an extremely high 'I' count relative to its population, which might be an anomaly or indicate a severe local outbreak. Re-evaluating the 'I/Pop' for Mississippi with a more reasonable total population estimate for a state of its size would likely lower this imported infection number. Given the direct impact of inbound flow and the current data, restricting New Mexico's travel flow, which is the largest by volume, offers the most direct and impactful reduction in potential imported cases. This decision prioritizes mitigating the largest single source of inbound traffic, balancing epidemic control with the need to limit mobility disruption to a single, high-volume corridor."

  "global_guidance": "Intervention reasoning: 1. Risk assessment: Mississippi presents the highest risk due to its significantly elevated proportion of Infected (I) and Exposed (E) individuals relative to its total population, with an (I+E)/Population ratio of approximately 0.151. This indicates a high prevalence of active and incubating cases. Other states like New Mexico, Arizona, and Virginia have much lower (I+E)/Population ratios, ranging from approximately 0.0049 to 0.0066. 2. Quantitative import logic: The expected number of imported infections is calculated by multiplying the baseline inbound flow by the (I+E)/Total Population ratio of the origin state. For Mississippi, this yields approximately 5774 potential imported infections daily. In contrast, New Mexico (despite high inflow) accounts for about 469, Arizona for 266, and Virginia for 164 daily potential imported infections. 3. Justification of selection: Mississippi is prioritized for restriction because its high internal disease prevalence translates into a substantially higher number of potential imported infections. A 50% restriction on Mississippi's inbound flow is projected to prevent approximately 2887 potential infections daily, offering the greatest impact on minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Texas compared to any other single state. 4. Trade-offs: While restricting travel from Mississippi entails mobility disruption, this action is critical for epidemic control. The significant reduction in potential disease importation from Mississippi outweighs the localized inconvenience, directly contributing to protecting Texas's population. The policy ensures the reduced flow can be reallocated, mitigating broader economic impact."

Quantitatively, applying the restriction on Mississippi is projected to reduce daily imported infections by approximately 1394 (0.5 * 35590.5 inbound flow * 0.07834 infection prevalence). This reduction is significantly greater than the potential reductions from Arizona (27), New Mexico (174), or Virginia (32). Therefore, prioritizing Mississippi for a 50% inbound travel restriction is justified to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas, despite the associated mobility disruption for approximately 17,795 daily travelers."

Restricting travel from new mexico by 50% is projected to yield the greatest reduction in potential imported cases, thereby mitigating the spread within Texas. This intervention balances epidemic control by targeting the highest import risk while limiting mobility disruption to a single, most impactful origin state."
