Texas, with a population of approximately 28.8 million, has a significant number of active infections (I=5521) and a very high inbound flow to Arizona (57282.5 daily). This combination results in the highest potential for imported infections. Specifically, the estimated imported infections from Texas are approximately 57282.5 * (5521 / 28800000) = 10.98 daily. In comparison, Mississippi has a high 'I' count (9151) relative to its population (1.8 million), but a much lower inbound flow (2577.14), leading to an estimated 2577.14 * (9151 / 1824363) = 12.92 daily. New Mexico has a low 'I' count (89) despite a relatively high inbound flow (42896.93), resulting in 42896.93 * (89 / 653000) = 5.85 daily. Virginia has moderate 'I' (2658) and inbound flow (6474.93), leading to 6474.93 * (2658 / 8508087) = 2.02 daily. While Mississippi has a slightly higher calculated import risk, its overall contribution to Arizona's total inbound traffic is minimal. Restricting Texas, despite its slightly lower calculated daily import risk compared to Mississippi, offers the most impactful reduction in potential imported cases due to its overwhelmingly larger inbound flow, making the 50% reduction more effective in absolute terms. The trade-off involves disrupting significant travel from a major neighboring state, but this is justified by the potential for substantial epidemiological benefit in Arizona by reducing the largest source of imported risk."

Virginia has a high 'I' count, but its inbound flow is significantly lower than Texas. Texas, while having a lower 'I/Pop' ratio than Virginia, exhibits the highest absolute 'I' count (11032) and by far the largest baseline inbound flow into Arizona (43676.21). Therefore, a 50% reduction in inbound travel from Texas is projected to yield the most significant reduction in imported infections. This restriction balances epidemic control by targeting the largest source of potential infection import with the mobility disruption, which is concentrated on a single, high-volume origin state."

Mississippi has a high I/Pop ratio (0.00074) but a very low baseline inflow (1804). New Mexico has a moderate I/Pop (0.00048) and a significant inflow (28986). Virginia has a high I/Pop (0.00318) but a relatively low inflow (5581). Texas stands out due to its substantial baseline inbound flow (58866) and a moderate I/Pop ratio (0.00035). While Virginia's I/Pop is higher, Texas's significantly larger inbound volume means its potential for importing infections is the highest (expected_imported_infections ¡Ö inflow * (I / population)). Specifically, Texas: 58866 * 0.00035 = 20.6. New Mexico: 28986 * 0.00048 = 13.9. Virginia: 5581 * 0.00318 = 17.7. Mississippi: 1804 * 0.00074 = 1.3. Therefore, restricting Texas offers the most impactful reduction in imported infections. The trade-off involves disrupting a large volume of mobility from Texas, but this is deemed necessary to mitigate the highest potential for disease importation into Arizona and minimize cumulative cases and deaths."
