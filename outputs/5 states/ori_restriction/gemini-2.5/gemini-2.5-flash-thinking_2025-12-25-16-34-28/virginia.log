We calculated the estimated imported infections for each origin state by multiplying their baseline inbound flow by their average 'I' (Infected) population proportion. Texas exhibits the highest baseline inbound flow into Virginia (26216.86 daily) and a significant 'I' population (3740 out of 28287391 total, or 0.0132percent). This combination results in the highest estimated daily imported infections (26216.86 * 0.000132 = 3.46 per day). While Mississippi has a higher 'I' proportion (6768 out of 2249941 total, or 0.3008percent), its inbound flow is considerably lower (4946.93 daily), leading to fewer estimated imported infections (4946.93 * 0.003008 = 1.49 per day). Arizona and New Mexico have both lower 'I' populations and lower inbound flows, resulting in minimal estimated imported infections. Therefore, restricting inbound travel from Texas by 50percent is projected to yield the most significant reduction in imported infections, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia. The trade-off involves disrupting travel from Texas, which is balanced by the potential for substantial public health benefits."
