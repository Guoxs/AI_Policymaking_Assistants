Texas: Has the largest population (S=28.9M) and highest baseline inbound flow (117,318.86) to New Mexico. While its I count (327) is lower than some others, its Q count (7619) and D count (330) indicate significant disease activity. The sheer volume of traffic makes it a high-risk source for imported cases. \n2. Arizona: Moderate population (S=7.2M), moderate inbound flow (18,891.86). Has a relatively high I count (962) and Q count (3319). \n3. Virginia: Moderate population (S=8.5M), low inbound flow (1,118.21). Has the highest I count (3189) and Q count (4825) among the origin states, indicating high prevalence. \n4. Mississippi: Smallest population (S=2.9M), low inbound flow (1,902.57). Moderate I count (1753) and Q count (2463).\n\nQuantitative import logic: The expected number of imported infections can be approximated as: `inbound_flow * (E + I) / S_origin`. \n- Texas: 117318.86 * (927 + 327) / 28984537 「 5.09 E+I per day. \n- Arizona: 18891.86 * (1952 + 962) / 7272180 「 7.57 E+I per day. \n- Virginia: 1118.21 * (1825 + 3189) / 8524995 「 0.66 E+I per day. \n- Mississippi: 1902.57 * (906 + 1753) / 2970629 「 1.69 E+I per day. \n\nJustification of selection: Arizona shows the highest potential for imported infections when considering the (E+I)/S ratio multiplied by flow. However, Texas has an extremely high baseline inbound flow, and even a moderate (E+I)/S ratio leads to a significant absolute number of potential imports. Given the objective to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico, reducing the largest inbound flow offers the most substantial reduction in overall potential imports. While Virginia has a high I count, its low inbound flow makes its absolute contribution to New Mexico's imported cases much smaller. Therefore, restricting Texas, despite Arizona's higher normalized risk, is chosen due to the large absolute volume of traffic. The 50% reduction in Texas's flow will reduce the daily potential E+I imports from Texas by approximately 2.54, which is a significant reduction. \n\nTrade-offs: Restricting Texas will cause the most significant mobility disruption due to its large baseline flow, potentially impacting economic and social ties. However, this disruption is balanced against the significant potential for reducing disease transmission in New Mexico by cutting off the largest source of inbound travelers."

This considers both currently infectious and exposed individuals who might become infectious. \n\nCalculations for imported risk (I/Pop * Inflow + E/Pop * Inflow):\n- Arizona: (1543/10603073 * 25519) + (21174/10603073 * 25519) = 0.37 + 0.51 = 0.88\n- Mississippi: (8196/734501 * 1311.07) + (17370/734501 * 1311.07) = 14.63 + 31.00 = 45.63\n- Texas: (12208/29753596 * 143401.57) + (7220/29753596 * 143401.57) = 58.91 + 34.84 = 93.75\n- Virginia: (4637/8148192 * 1926.14) + (19555/8148192 * 1926.14) = 1.09 + 4.62 = 5.71\n\nJustification of selection: Texas is prioritized due to its significantly higher potential for imported infections into New Mexico, primarily driven by its very large inbound flow (143,401.57 daily) despite moderate I and E rates. While Mississippi has a higher I/Pop and E/Pop ratio, its inbound flow to New Mexico is substantially lower (1,311.07 daily), leading to a much lower absolute number of potential imported cases. Restricting Texas is projected to yield the greatest reduction in imported cases, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico.\n\nTrade-offs: Restricting Texas will lead to a 50percent reduction in its inbound flow to New Mexico, which represents a significant mobility disruption given the high baseline flow. However, this disruption is deemed necessary given the objective to minimize disease spread in New Mexico. The 50percent reduction offers a balance between epidemic control and completely halting essential travel.'

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico, we assess the risk posed by potential inbound infections from each origin state. We estimate the expected imported infections by considering the inbound flow and the proportion of infected individuals (I) in the origin state's population. For Arizona, with a population of ~10.4M and I=12569, and an inflow of 47761, the risk is moderate. Mississippi, with a small population and low I, and an inflow of 2140, poses minimal risk. Virginia, despite a higher I, has a relatively small inflow of 1513, limiting its impact. Texas, however, presents the highest risk due to its substantial population (~28.8M), a significant number of infected individuals (I=10353), and a very large baseline inbound flow of 146485.29. The quantitative import logic suggests that Texas's high inflow combined with a non-negligible 'I' population makes it the primary source of potential infection import. Therefore, prioritizing Texas for a 50% inbound travel restriction is justified, as it is expected to yield the most significant reduction in imported infections, thereby mitigating the rise in cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico, despite the mobility disruption."

We calculate the expected imported infections by multiplying the baseline daily inbound flow by the proportion of infected individuals (I) in the origin state's population.

Although Texas has a lower I/Population ratio than Arizona, its significantly higher baseline inbound flow results in a larger absolute number of expected imported infections. Therefore, restricting inbound travel from Texas is prioritized due to its substantial contribution to potential imported infections, offering the most significant reduction in disease spread for New Mexico. This intervention balances the need for epidemic control with mobility disruption, as Texas represents the largest single source of inbound traffic and thus the greatest opportunity for impact."
