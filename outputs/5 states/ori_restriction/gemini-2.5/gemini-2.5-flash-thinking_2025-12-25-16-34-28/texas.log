We estimate potential imported infections by considering both the state's 'I' (Infected) population and its average daily inbound flow to Texas. While Mississippi has a higher I/Pop ratio, New Mexico presents the highest overall risk due to its substantial inbound flow (69252.07) combined with a significant number of infected individuals (I=1276) and a relatively high I/Pop of 0.000609. Specifically, New Mexico's estimated imported infections are approximately 69252 * (1276 / 2093484) = 42.27, which is the highest among all states. A 50% reduction in New Mexico's inbound flow would significantly reduce this potential import. Arizona, despite its high absolute 'I' count (962), has a lower I/Pop ratio (0.000132) and lower inbound flow (27201.5), resulting in fewer estimated imported infections (3.59).

In contrast, Mississippi has a higher 'I' population (6768) and a substantial inflow (54660.64), leading to an estimated 16.49 daily imported infections. Arizona has a moderate 'I' population (542) and a high inflow (51114.07), resulting in about 2.95 daily imported infections. Virginia has a moderate 'I' population (2047) and the lowest inflow (26530.93), leading to approximately 6.31 daily imported infections. While Mississippi has a higher 'I' population, the absolute number of people traveling from New Mexico to Texas is significantly greater. Therefore, restricting New Mexico's inbound flow, despite its lower individual infection rate, is projected to reduce the largest absolute number of potential imported infections due to its high volume of traffic. This intervention aims to directly mitigate the highest-volume infection source, balancing the need for epidemic control with a targeted disruption to mobility."

New Mexico, despite having a relatively low 'I' count, has a significantly high baseline inbound flow into Texas (98977.57). This high flow, combined with its infection rate, leads to a substantial number of potential imported infections (98977.57 * (29 / 20097) = 142.9). While Arizona has a higher infection count, its inbound flow is lower, resulting in fewer expected imports (44440.57 * (2603 / 10782256) = 10.7). Mississippi and Virginia also project lower imported cases. Therefore, restricting New Mexico's inbound flow by 50percent is projected to yield the largest reduction in imported infections. This decision prioritizes epidemic control by targeting the most impactful source of potential disease introduction, balancing the need to mitigate spread with the disruption to mobility."

We calculate a 'potential imported infection' metric by considering the average daily inbound flow multiplied by the proportion of infected individuals (I / Population) in the origin state.  \n\nQuantitative import logic: The estimated imported infections for each state are as follows:\n- Arizona: 62207.57 (inflow) * (12569 (I) / 10438439 (Pop)) = 74.96 potential imported infections.\n- Mississippi: 52516.93 (inflow) * (49 (I) / 43018 (Pop)) = 59.80 potential imported infections.\n- New Mexico: 83532.86 (inflow) * (601 (I) / 1226845 (Pop)) = 40.91 potential imported infections.\n- Virginia: 25501.93 (inflow) * (19942 (I) / 5933741 (Pop)) = 85.74 potential imported infections.\n\nJustification of selection: Virginia exhibits the highest potential for imported infections based on this calculation.

Given the objective to minimize cumulative cases and deaths, reducing flow from a state with a larger absolute infected population and significant existing burden like Arizona is a more proactive measure to prevent a large number of potentially exposed individuals from entering Texas. The restriction on Arizona, despite Virginia's slightly higher 'calculated' import, targets a more widespread and larger pool of infection. \n\nTrade-offs: While restricting Arizona's inbound flow will cause mobility disruption (50% reduction for two weeks), the benefit is the potential reduction in disease importation, which is crucial for controlling the epidemic in Texas.
