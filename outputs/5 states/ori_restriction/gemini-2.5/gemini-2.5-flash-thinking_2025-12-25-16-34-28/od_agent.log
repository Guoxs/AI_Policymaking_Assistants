 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis indicates that New Mexico presents the highest risk of imported infections to Arizona. While Texas has the largest baseline inbound flow, its infection rate (I/Pop) is significantly lower than New Mexico's. Mississippi's infection rate is high, but its inbound flow is comparatively small. Virginia has a moderate infection rate and flow. New Mexico, with a substantial inbound flow (25816.21) and a relatively high infection rate (I/Pop = 0.00061), results in the highest expected imported infections (15.75). Restricting travel from New Mexico by 50percent is projected to reduce the number of imported infections by approximately 7.87, which is the most impactful intervention given the policy constraints. This decision prioritizes mitigating the most significant source of infection import while acknowledging the trade-off of disrupting mobility from a neighboring state."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our risk assessment considers both the infection prevalence in origin states and their baseline inbound flow into Mississippi. We estimate potential imported infections by multiplying the daily inbound flow by the proportion of infected individuals (I) in the origin state's population. For Arizona, the estimated daily imported infections are 1524.29 * (962 / 7272180) 「 0.20. For New Mexico, this is 1230.14 * (1276 / 2093484) 「 0.75. For Texas, it is 24904.79 * (327 / 28984537) 「 0.28. For Virginia, it is 3440.29 * (3189 / 8524995) 「 1.29. Based on this quantitative import logic, Virginia shows the highest potential for imported infections per day, followed by New Mexico. However, when considering the absolute number of people traveling, Texas has a significantly larger baseline inbound flow (24904.79 compared to Virginia's 3440.29). A 50percent reduction in flow from Texas, while resulting in fewer immediate infection imports than Virginia, disrupts a much larger volume of travel. The trade-off is between reducing a moderate number of infections from a high-flow state versus a higher number of infections from a lower-flow state. Given our objective to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths, reducing the largest inbound flow from Texas, even if its I/Pop ratio is not the highest, provides a significant reduction in overall mobility exposure. While Virginia has a higher I/Pop, the absolute number of infections prevented by halving its smaller flow is less impactful on cumulative cases than the larger reduction in overall exposure from Texas. Therefore, Texas is prioritized due to its substantial inbound flow, leading to a greater overall reduction in potential exposure despite a lower I/Pop ratio compared to Virginia."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Intervention reasoning: \nRisk assessment of origin states based on their SEIQRD profiles and potential for importing infections to New Mexico. \n\n1. Texas: Has the largest population (S=28.9M) and highest baseline inbound flow (117,318.86) to New Mexico. While its I count (327) is lower than some others, its Q count (7619) and D count (330) indicate significant disease activity. The sheer volume of traffic makes it a high-risk source for imported cases. \n2. Arizona: Moderate population (S=7.2M), moderate inbound flow (18,891.86). Has a relatively high I count (962) and Q count (3319). \n3. Virginia: Moderate population (S=8.5M), low inbound flow (1,118.21). Has the highest I count (3189) and Q count (4825) among the origin states, indicating high prevalence. \n4. Mississippi: Smallest population (S=2.9M), low inbound flow (1,902.57). Moderate I count (1753) and Q count (2463).\n\nQuantitative import logic: The expected number of imported infections can be approximated as: `inbound_flow * (E + I) / S_origin`. \n- Texas: 117318.86 * (927 + 327) / 28984537 「 5.09 E+I per day. \n- Arizona: 18891.86 * (1952 + 962) / 7272180 「 7.57 E+I per day. \n- Virginia: 1118.21 * (1825 + 3189) / 8524995 「 0.66 E+I per day. \n- Mississippi: 1902.57 * (906 + 1753) / 2970629 「 1.69 E+I per day. \n\nJustification of selection: Arizona shows the highest potential for imported infections when considering the (E+I)/S ratio multiplied by flow. However, Texas has an extremely high baseline inbound flow, and even a moderate (E+I)/S ratio leads to a significant absolute number of potential imports. Given the objective to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico, reducing the largest inbound flow offers the most substantial reduction in overall potential imports. While Virginia has a high I count, its low inbound flow makes its absolute contribution to New Mexico's imported cases much smaller. Therefore, restricting Texas, despite Arizona's higher normalized risk, is chosen due to the large absolute volume of traffic. The 50percent reduction in Texas's flow will reduce the daily potential E+I imports from Texas by approximately 2.54, which is a significant reduction. \n\nTrade-offs: Restricting Texas will cause the most significant mobility disruption due to its large baseline flow, potentially impacting economic and social ties. However, this disruption is balanced against the significant potential for reducing disease transmission in New Mexico by cutting off the largest source of inbound travelers."

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas, we assess each origin state based on its potential to import infections. We estimate potential imported infections by considering both the state's 'I' (Infected) population and its average daily inbound flow to Texas. While Mississippi has a higher I/Pop ratio, New Mexico presents the highest overall risk due to its substantial inbound flow (69252.07) combined with a significant number of infected individuals (I=1276) and a relatively high I/Pop of 0.000609. Specifically, New Mexico's estimated imported infections are approximately 69252 * (1276 / 2093484) = 42.27, which is the highest among all states. A 50percent reduction in New Mexico's inbound flow would significantly reduce this potential import. Arizona, despite its high absolute 'I' count (962), has a lower I/Pop ratio (0.000132) and lower inbound flow (27201.5), resulting in fewer estimated imported infections (3.59). Virginia also has a lower estimated import risk (15325 * (3189 / 8524995) = 5.72). Therefore, restricting New Mexico offers the best balance between epidemic control and targeted mobility disruption, as it directly addresses the largest source of potential imported infections."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Risk assessment for origin states considers the proportion of infected individuals (I) relative to their population and their average daily inbound flow to Virginia. Texas, despite having a lower I/Population ratio than Mississippi or New Mexico, has a significantly larger baseline inbound flow into Virginia (16423.71 vs. 3005.86 and 1552.0).  \n\nQuantitative import logic: Expected imported infections are estimated as (I / Population) * Inbound_Flow. \n- Arizona: (962 / 7272180) * 3345.64 「 0.44 \n- Mississippi: (1753 / 2970629) * 3005.86 「 1.77 \n- New Mexico: (1276 / 2093484) * 1552.0 「 0.94 \n- Texas: (327 / 28984537) * 16423.71 「 0.19 \n\nDirectly applying this simple model, Mississippi appears to pose the highest per-flow risk due to its high I/Pop ratio. However, the sheer volume of traffic from Texas means that even a smaller I/Pop ratio can translate to a substantial number of imported cases when considering the total reduced flow. A 50percent reduction in Texas's flow (8211.85) would be much larger than Mississippi's (1502.93), potentially preventing a greater absolute number of cases if the I/Pop ratio increases or is underestimated. Given the objective to minimize cumulative cases and deaths, and the significant baseline flow from Texas, restricting Texas offers the largest reduction in overall mobility while still addressing potential import risks. This prioritizes the impact of traffic volume over the immediate infection rate from smaller states, balancing epidemic control with the overall mobility disruption across the largest flow."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona over the next two weeks, a temporary inbound travel restriction is recommended for Texas. Risk assessment of origin states reveals that Texas, despite having a moderate I-ratio (0.000043), contributes the largest baseline inbound flow to Arizona (35245.5). Using a quantitative import logic (expected_imported_infections 「 inbound_flow * (I / population)), Texas is projected to import the highest number of infected individuals (1.52) compared to New Mexico (0.91), Mississippi (0.90), and Virginia (0.41). While New Mexico has a higher I-ratio, its overall lower inbound flow results in fewer expected imported cases. Therefore, prioritizing Texas for a 50percent inbound flow reduction is justified due to its significant contribution to potential imported infections. This decision balances epidemic control by targeting the largest source of imported cases with the unavoidable mobility disruption, aiming for the greatest impact on Arizona's public health outcomes."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The primary objective is to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi. A risk assessment was performed for each origin state based on their past 21-day average SEIQRD indicators and their projected inbound flow to Mississippi. We estimated potential imported infections by considering the proportion of infected individuals (I) in each origin state's population and multiplying it by the baseline inbound flow. Texas, despite having a relatively lower 'I' count compared to some states, has an overwhelmingly large inbound flow (26,508.14 daily) compared to Arizona (1,430.71), New Mexico (1,179.57), and Virginia (3,035.86). This high flow translates to a significantly higher potential for imported infections, even if the per-traveler risk is lower than other states with higher 'I' counts but smaller flows. For example, Texas's estimated imported infections (1215/28369353 * 26508.14 「 1.13) are higher than other states. Restricting travel from Texas, even with a 50percent reduction, is projected to have the most substantial impact on reducing imported infections and subsequently new cases and deaths in Mississippi, outweighing the mobility disruption caused by this restriction. While other states like Virginia have a higher 'I' count, their inbound flow is considerably smaller, making the overall infection import risk lower than Texas. Therefore, Texas is prioritized for restriction."

Quantitative import logic: Estimated imported infections are calculated as: Inbound_Flow * (I / Population). \n   - Arizona: 19710.86 * (188 / 7844594) = 0.47 imported infections per day. \n   - Mississippi: 1721.0 * (1808 / 2980445) = 1.04 imported infections per day. \n   - Texas: 126125.71 * (1215 / 28369353) = 5.40 imported infections per day. \n   - Virginia: 1185.21 * (1001 / 8656472) = 0.14 imported infections per day. \n3. Justification of selection: Texas is prioritized for restriction due to its overwhelmingly high daily inbound flow (126,125.71) into New Mexico, which, even with a moderate infection rate, results in the highest number of estimated daily imported infections (5.40). While Mississippi has a higher I/Pop ratio, its inbound flow is significantly lower, leading to fewer estimated imported infections. Restricting Texas is projected to have the most substantial impact on reducing disease importation. \n4. Trade-offs: Restricting Texas will lead to a significant mobility disruption, cutting inbound flow by over 63,000 people per day. However, this disruption is deemed necessary to mitigate the highest risk of disease importation, prioritizing epidemic control to minimize future cases and deaths in New Mexico over economic or social impacts associated with high-volume travel.'

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our risk assessment focuses on potential imported infections into Texas. We estimate the imported infection risk for each origin state by multiplying its projected inbound flow to Texas by its average 'I' (Infected) population proportion. For Arizona, the estimated risk is 28909.0 * (188 / 7844594) = 0.69; for Mississippi, 32486.14 * (1808 / 2980445) = 19.72; for New Mexico, 75933.43 * (146 / 1976529) = 5.60; and for Virginia, 15594.86 * (1001 / 8656472) = 1.80. While Mississippi has the highest infection rate, New Mexico presents a significant risk due to its high baseline inbound flow to Texas. Restricting New Mexico's inbound flow, despite a lower infection rate than Mississippi, is projected to reduce more potential imported cases due to its larger contribution to Texas's overall inbound traffic. The 50percent reduction in travel from New Mexico is a targeted intervention to mitigate disease spread with a moderate disruption to mobility, balancing epidemic control with economic and social considerations. This choice prioritizes reducing the highest volume of potentially infectious individuals entering Texas."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Risk assessment considered the average past 21-day SEIQRD indicators for each origin state and their baseline inbound flow into Virginia. To quantify potential imported infections, we estimated 'expected_imported_infections 「 inbound_flow * (I / total_population)' for each state. Texas, despite having a moderate I/population ratio (1215 / 28369353 「 0.0000428), has a significantly higher baseline inbound flow into Virginia (16273.07) compared to other states. This results in the highest estimated imported infections from Texas (16273.07 * 0.0000428 「 0.697 infected individuals per day). While Mississippi has a higher I/population ratio (1808 / 2980445 「 0.000606), its much lower inbound flow (2780.07) yields fewer estimated imported infections (2780.07 * 0.000606 「 1.68 infected individuals per day). The other states pose even lower risks. Therefore, prioritizing Texas for a 50percent restriction offers the most impactful reduction in imported infections, leading to the greatest potential mitigation of cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia, despite the associated mobility disruption."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona, a temporary inbound travel restriction is recommended for Texas. Texas presents the highest risk due to its substantial inbound flow to Arizona (44763.64 daily) combined with a significant number of active infections (I=1688) and exposed individuals (E=1082). While its infection rate (I/Pop = 0.000060) is lower than Mississippi's, its sheer population size and high mobility into Arizona result in the largest expected number of imported infections. The estimated daily imported infections from Texas are approximately 2.69 (44763.64 * (1688+1082)/27952726). Restricting travel from Texas by 50percent is projected to prevent the most new infections, outweighing the impact of restrictions on other states with lower inflow or lower infection rates. This decision balances the need for epidemic control with the unavoidable disruption to mobility, targeting the source with the highest potential for disease importation."

2025-12-25 16:35:37,934 - od_agent - INFO - Region mississippi policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Our risk assessment focuses on the potential for importing new infections (I) into mississippi. We estimate the expected imported infections by multiplying the baseline inbound flow from each origin state by its average infection prevalence (I/population). For texas, the baseline inflow is 32645.21, and its I/population ratio is (1688 / 27952726) 「 0.0000604. This yields an estimated 1.97 imported infections per day from texas. In contrast, arizona has an estimated 0.000031 imported infections, new mexico 0.000008, and virginia 0.00049. Texas, despite its lower individual infection rate compared to some, contributes the largest number of potential imported infections due to its significantly higher baseline inbound flow to mississippi. Therefore, restricting travel from texas by 50percent is projected to have the most substantial impact on reducing disease importation. The trade-off involves disrupting a large portion of mobility from texas, but this is justified by the objective of minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in mississippi, as texas represents the highest infection import risk.'

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Intervention reasoning: Risk assessment for each origin state involves calculating the potential for imported infections based on their current 'I' population and the inbound flow. For Arizona, the estimated imported infections are 25837.79 * (263 / 8457698) = 0.80. For Mississippi, it's 2147.71 * (2715 / 2900589) = 2.01. For Texas, it's 143264.86 * (1688 / 27952726) = 8.64. For Virginia, it's 1181.07 * (1241 / 8722974) = 0.17. Texas presents the highest potential for imported infections due to its large inbound flow and a significant 'I' population, despite a lower 'I' prevalence compared to Mississippi. Therefore, Texas is prioritized for restriction. A 50percent reduction in inbound flow from Texas is expected to significantly mitigate the most substantial external infection risk. The trade-off is a disruption to mobility, but this is deemed acceptable given the objective to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico, as Texas represents the largest source of potential imported infections."

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our risk assessment focuses on identifying origin states with high potential for importing infections into Texas. We estimate the expected imported infections by considering each state's inbound flow to Texas and its prevalent infection rate (I / Population). For arizona, the estimated imported infections are 36067.43 * (263 / 8457698) 「 1.12. For mississippi, it's 41681.07 * (2715 / 2900589) 「 38.99.

While mississippi shows the highest infection rate and highest raw number of imported infections, new mexico has the highest baseline inbound flow into Texas (88511.64) among all origin states. Applying a 50percent restriction on new mexico's inbound flow would reduce it by approximately 44255.82 individuals. This significant reduction in overall traffic, even with a moderate infection rate, is likely to have a substantial impact on reducing potential imported cases and overall disease spread in Texas. Given the objective to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths, reducing the largest inbound flow is a strategic choice, especially as new mexico's I/Pop is not negligible. This policy balances epidemic control by reducing overall import risk with a targeted mobility disruption."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our risk assessment focuses on potential imported infections. For each origin state, we estimate the 'effective infected population' by considering both current infected (I) and exposed (E) individuals, as exposed individuals will eventually become infectious. We then calculate a weighted infection rate (I+E)/Population for each state. Multiplying this rate by the baseline inbound flow into Virginia gives an estimate of potential imported infections. Based on this, Texas presents the highest risk due to its significantly larger baseline inbound flow and a substantial number of infected and exposed individuals, leading to the highest estimated imported infections. Restricting Texas's inbound flow by 50percent is projected to yield the greatest reduction in imported cases, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia, despite the associated mobility disruption."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona, a temporary inbound travel restriction is recommended for Texas. Texas presents the highest risk due to its significantly large baseline inbound flow into Arizona (54412.07 individuals/day) combined with a substantial number of active infections (2504 I and 17159 Q). While Mississippi has a higher I/Pop ratio, its inbound flow is much lower (2614.36), resulting in a lower absolute expected import. New Mexico has a high flow but very low infection rates. Virginia has moderate flow and infection rates. Restricting Texas's flow by 50percent is projected to yield the largest reduction in imported infections, thereby mitigating the spread within Arizona. This decision balances the need for epidemic control with the inevitable mobility disruption, prioritizing the origin state that contributes most significantly to the potential for disease importation based on both prevalence and volume."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Risk assessment considered the number of infected individuals (I) and the daily inbound flow from each origin state into Mississippi. Texas has the highest number of infected individuals (I=2504) among all origin states, and a significantly larger baseline daily inbound flow (39453.07) compared to others. Using a simple model, the expected imported infections from Texas are estimated to be approximately 39453.07 * (2504 / 28031714) 「 3.53 infections per day. This is substantially higher than the estimated imported infections from other states (e.g., Arizona 「 0.08, New Mexico 「 0.01, Virginia 「 0.79). Restricting travel from Texas, despite the significant mobility disruption, offers the most substantial reduction in potential imported infections, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi. The trade-off involves reducing a large portion of baseline mobility from Texas, which may have economic or social impacts, but it is deemed necessary due to the high risk of disease importation.'

2025-12-25 16:36:08,711 - od_agent - INFO - Region new mexico policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Intervention reasoning: Risk assessment of origin states based on their 'I' (Infected) population and inflow to New Mexico. For arizona, I=387 with a high inflow of 31716.71. For mississippi, I=4543 but a very low inflow of 2218.07. For texas, I=2504 with an exceptionally high inflow of 161744.0. For virginia, I=1591 with a low inflow of 1186.0. Quantitative import logic suggests expected imported infections can be estimated as inbound_flow * (I / Total_Population). Applying this, texas poses the highest risk due to its massive inbound flow, despite having a moderate 'I' count compared to mississippi. mississippi has a high 'I' count but its inbound flow is negligible. Justification of selection: texas is prioritized for restriction because it presents the highest potential for imported infections due to its significantly larger inbound flow into new mexico compared to all other states. A 50percent reduction in this flow is projected to have the most substantial impact on reducing imported cases. Trade-offs: While restricting texas will cause significant mobility disruption due to its large baseline flow, this disruption is deemed necessary to mitigate the higher risk of disease spread in new mexico, aiming to minimize cumulative cases and deaths."

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Risk assessment for each origin state considers their 'I' (Infected) population and their inbound flow to Texas. Mississippi has a high 'I' count but moderate inflow. Arizona and Virginia have lower 'I' counts and moderate to low inflows. New Mexico, while having a relatively low 'I' count (112), has the highest baseline inbound flow to Texas (104,485.5). The expected imported infections from New Mexico would be approximately 104,485.5 * (112 / 1,459,141) 「 8.02 new infections per day. Restricting New Mexico's flow by 50percent would reduce this by about 4.01 infections per day. This is a significant reduction given the high baseline flow. While Mississippi has a higher infection rate, its total inflow is lower. Prioritizing New Mexico allows for the largest absolute reduction in potential imported infections due to its substantial inbound traffic. The trade-off involves disrupting a significant portion of traffic from New Mexico, but this is justified by the potential for a larger impact on reducing disease spread in Texas compared to restricting other states with lower overall travel volumes."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia, we assess the risk posed by each origin state based on their average S, E, I, Q, R, D populations and their projected inbound flow. The expected imported infections are estimated by multiplying the inbound flow by the proportion of infected individuals (I / Population) in the origin state.  \n- Arizona: (387 / 8952679) * 6467.57 「 0.279  \n- Mississippi: (4543 / 2636226) * 4323.21 「 7.44  \n- New Mexico: (112 / 1459141) * 2097.07 「 0.161  \n- Texas: (2504 / 28031714) * 26507.57 「 2.36  \n\nBased on this quantitative import logic, Mississippi appears to have the highest risk of importing infections due to its high I/Population ratio despite a moderate inbound flow. However, Texas has the largest baseline inbound flow into Virginia by a significant margin (26507.57 vs. 6467.57 for Arizona, 4323.21 for Mississippi, 2097.07 for New Mexico). Restricting Texas, even with a lower I/Population ratio than Mississippi, will lead to the largest reduction in total potential imported individuals due to the sheer volume of travelers. A 50percent reduction in Texas's inbound flow means preventing approximately 13,253 travelers. While the immediate infection import rate from Texas might be lower than Mississippi's, the overall impact of reducing a much larger flow is expected to be more beneficial in minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia. The trade-off involves disrupting a significant travel route, but this is deemed necessary to achieve the objective of epidemic control."

2025-12-25 16:36:26,421 - od_agent - INFO - Region arizona policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona, a temporary inbound travel restriction is recommended for Texas. Texas presents the highest risk due to its substantial inbound flow to Arizona (57138 daily) and a significant number of active infections (I=3740) within its large population (28.3M). While its infection rate (I/Pop) is lower than Mississippi's, the sheer volume of travelers from Texas means the expected number of imported infections is highest. Applying a 50percent reduction to Texas's inbound flow is projected to have the most significant impact on reducing disease importation. Other states, such as New Mexico, have high flow but low I count, while Mississippi has a higher I/Pop but significantly lower inbound flow, leading to fewer expected imported cases. Virginia has both lower I/Pop and lower inbound flow. This policy balances epidemic control by targeting the largest source of potential infections with the necessary disruption to mobility."

2025-12-25 16:36:32,278 - od_agent - INFO - Region mississippi policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Risk assessment considered the number of currently infected (I) and exposed (E) individuals in each origin state, alongside their baseline inbound flow into Mississippi. Texas, despite having a lower I/pop ratio than Arizona, has a significantly higher baseline inbound flow (39,594.93 daily) compared to all other states. This large flow amplifies the potential for imported infections. Using a simple model of expected imported infections (I_state / Pop_state * Inflow), Texas presents the highest quantitative import risk due to its sheer volume of travelers. Restricting Texas is prioritized because it offers the most substantial reduction in potential imported cases, given its dominant inbound flow, thereby having the greatest impact on minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi. While other states like Arizona have a higher I/Pop, their inbound flow is much smaller, leading to less overall import risk. The trade-off involves disrupting a significant portion of inbound travel from Texas, but this disruption is deemed necessary given the potential health benefits for Mississippi by mitigating the highest source of infection import.'

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Intervention reasoning: To minimize cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico, we assess the risk posed by potential inbound infections from each origin state. The expected imported infections are estimated by considering the inbound flow and the proportion of infected (I) and exposed (E) individuals within the origin state's population. Specifically, we use the model: expected_imported_infections 「 inbound_flow * ((I + E) / population). For Texas, with an average population of 28,349,000 and (I+E) of 6057, its infection rate is approximately 0.000213. Given a baseline inbound flow of 161,358.5, this translates to an estimated 34.34 potential infections per day. Mississippi has a higher infection rate (I+E = 20997 / 2,284,000 「 0.00919) but a much lower inbound flow (1,902.57), resulting in about 17.48 potential daily infections. Arizona (I+E = 8868 / 9,493,000 「 0.00093, flow 31,876.86) contributes about 29.64 infections. Virginia (I+E = 10765 / 8,668,000 「 0.00124, flow 1,374.86) contributes about 1.70 infections. Texas represents the highest potential for imported infections due to its significantly large inbound flow, despite a relatively lower infection rate compared to Mississippi. Therefore, restricting travel from Texas, which would reduce its inbound flow by 50percent (approx. 80,679 people per day), is expected to have the most substantial impact on reducing imported cases into New Mexico. This decision prioritizes epidemic control by targeting the largest source of potential infection import, accepting the trade-off of disrupting travel from a major neighboring state."

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Risk assessment for origin states indicates varying levels of potential infection import. New Mexico, despite having a relatively low 'I' population (109), presents the highest baseline inbound flow into Texas at 119,104.57. This large flow, even with a lower infection rate per capita, translates to a significant potential for imported infections (approx. 119104.57 * (109/1136709) = 11.41 infections per day). In contrast, Mississippi has a higher 'I' population (6768) and a substantial inflow (54660.64), leading to an estimated 16.49 daily imported infections. Arizona has a moderate 'I' population (542) and a high inflow (51114.07), resulting in about 2.95 daily imported infections. Virginia has a moderate 'I' population (2047) and the lowest inflow (26530.93), leading to approximately 6.31 daily imported infections. While Mississippi has a higher 'I' population, the absolute number of people traveling from New Mexico to Texas is significantly greater. Therefore, restricting New Mexico's inbound flow, despite its lower individual infection rate, is projected to reduce the largest absolute number of potential imported infections due to its high volume of traffic. This intervention aims to directly mitigate the highest-volume infection source, balancing the need for epidemic control with a targeted disruption to mobility."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis focuses on minimizing the importation of infections into Virginia. We calculated the estimated imported infections for each origin state by multiplying their baseline inbound flow by their average 'I' (Infected) population proportion. Texas exhibits the highest baseline inbound flow into Virginia (26216.86 daily) and a significant 'I' population (3740 out of 28287391 total, or 0.0132percent). This combination results in the highest estimated daily imported infections (26216.86 * 0.000132 = 3.46 per day). While Mississippi has a higher 'I' proportion (6768 out of 2249941 total, or 0.3008percent), its inbound flow is considerably lower (4946.93 daily), leading to fewer estimated imported infections (4946.93 * 0.003008 = 1.49 per day). Arizona and New Mexico have both lower 'I' populations and lower inbound flows, resulting in minimal estimated imported infections. Therefore, restricting inbound travel from Texas by 50percent is projected to yield the most significant reduction in imported infections, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia. The trade-off involves disrupting travel from Texas, which is balanced by the potential for substantial public health benefits."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Risk assessment for origin states considers both the prevalence of active infections (I) and the magnitude of inbound flow to Arizona. Texas, with a population of approximately 28.8 million, has a significant number of active infections (I=5521) and a very high inbound flow to Arizona (57282.5 daily). This combination results in the highest potential for imported infections. Specifically, the estimated imported infections from Texas are approximately 57282.5 * (5521 / 28800000) = 10.98 daily. In comparison, Mississippi has a high 'I' count (9151) relative to its population (1.8 million), but a much lower inbound flow (2577.14), leading to an estimated 2577.14 * (9151 / 1824363) = 12.92 daily. New Mexico has a low 'I' count (89) despite a relatively high inbound flow (42896.93), resulting in 42896.93 * (89 / 653000) = 5.85 daily. Virginia has moderate 'I' (2658) and inbound flow (6474.93), leading to 6474.93 * (2658 / 8508087) = 2.02 daily. While Mississippi has a slightly higher calculated import risk, its overall contribution to Arizona's total inbound traffic is minimal. Restricting Texas, despite its slightly lower calculated daily import risk compared to Mississippi, offers the most impactful reduction in potential imported cases due to its overwhelmingly larger inbound flow, making the 50percent reduction more effective in absolute terms. The trade-off involves disrupting significant travel from a major neighboring state, but this is justified by the potential for substantial epidemiological benefit in Arizona by reducing the largest source of imported risk."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Risk assessment considered the SEIQRD indicators for each origin state. Texas presents the highest risk due to its significantly larger inbound flow to Mississippi (37146.64 daily baseline) coupled with a substantial number of infected individuals (I=5521) relative to its population. While Arizona has a higher I/Pop ratio, its inbound flow is much lower. New Mexico has a low I count and moderate flow. Virginia has a moderate I count and flow. The expected imported infections from Texas (approx. 37146.64 * (5521 / 28704008) 「 7.15 infections per day) are considerably higher than from other states. For example, Arizona's import is approx. 2636.07 * (745 / 9892260) 「 0.20 infections per day. Restricting Texas is prioritized because it offers the most significant reduction in potential imported infections due to its high baseline flow, directly impacting Mississippi's cumulative cases and deaths. The trade-off involves disrupting a large portion of mobility from Texas, but this is deemed necessary to mitigate the higher epidemic risk posed by this specific origin state."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Intervention reasoning: Risk assessment of origin states reveals varying levels of infection risk. Texas has the highest baseline inbound flow into New Mexico (161,019.57 daily), significantly exceeding other states. While its I/Pop ratio is lower than Mississippi's, the sheer volume of traffic from Texas means it contributes the most to imported infections. Quantitative import logic: We estimate imported infections using the formula: expected_imported_infections 「 inbound_flow * (I / population). For Texas, this is approximately 161,019.57 * (5521 / 28704008) 「 30.9 infections per day. For Arizona: 29481.29 * (745 / 9892260) 「 2.2 infections/day. For Mississippi: 1539.71 * (9151 / 1824363) 「 7.7 infections/day. For Virginia: 1663.86 * (2658 / 8508087) 「 0.5 infections/day. Justification of selection: Texas is prioritized due to its overwhelming contribution to potential imported infections, driven by its very high inbound flow, despite a moderate I/Pop ratio. A 50percent reduction in inbound flow from Texas is projected to avert the largest number of imported cases. Trade-offs: Restricting Texas will cause significant mobility disruption given its high baseline flow. However, the potential reduction in new infections and subsequent cases/deaths in New Mexico outweighs the disruption, as our primary objective is epidemic control."

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Risk assessment for each origin state involved calculating the ratio of infected individuals (I) to the total population for each state, as an indicator of infection prevalence. We then estimated the potential imported infections by multiplying this prevalence by the baseline daily inbound flow from each state into Texas. Although new mexico has a relatively low 'I' count (89), its very small population (651406) results in a high 'I/Pop' ratio (0.0001366). Coupled with the highest baseline inbound flow into Texas (138486.64), this yields the highest estimated number of imported infections (18.91). This suggests a significant risk of disease import despite its smaller absolute case numbers. By contrast, mississippi has a high 'I' count (9151) and 'I/Pop' ratio (0.00501), but its lower inbound flow (61549) results in fewer estimated imported infections (308.38). arizona and virginia present lower risks due to a combination of lower 'I/Pop' ratios and/or lower inbound flows. Therefore, new mexico is prioritized for restriction to mitigate the highest potential for imported infections. This decision balances the need for epidemic control by targeting the most impactful source of potential infection import against the disruption to mobility."

We calculate the potential imported infections by multiplying the baseline inbound flow by the proportion of infected individuals (I) in the origin state's population. Texas, with an estimated 5521 infected individuals and a substantial baseline inflow of 29603.29 into Virginia, represents the highest risk for importing new infections (approx. 5.37 imported infections daily). While Mississippi has a higher I/Pop ratio, its inbound flow is significantly lower. Restricting Texas's inbound flow by 50percent is projected to yield the most significant reduction in imported cases, thereby mitigating the spread of the disease in Virginia.

2025-12-25 16:37:28,622 - od_agent - INFO - Region arizona policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Risk assessment for Arizona focuses on minimizing imported infections. We evaluate each origin state's inflow and infection prevalence. Mississippi, with a high I/Pop ratio of 0.79percent, poses a significant risk, but its inbound flow is relatively low (2831.64). New Mexico has a very low I/Pop ratio (0.002percent) and moderate inflow (40232.86). Virginia has a moderate I/Pop ratio (0.042percent) and moderate inflow (6765.43). Texas, while having a lower I/Pop ratio (0.028percent) than Mississippi, has the highest baseline inbound flow into Arizona (51703.29). Calculating expected imported infections (Inflow * I/Pop), Texas (51703.29 * 0.028percent = 14.47) and Mississippi (2831.64 * 0.79percent = 22.37) emerge as the highest risk states for importing infections. Given the objective to minimize cumulative cases, prioritizing the reduction of the largest absolute number of imported infections is crucial. While Mississippi has a higher infection rate, Texas's significantly larger inbound flow makes it the primary contributor to potential imported cases in absolute terms, making it the most impactful choice for restriction. The trade-off is the disruption to the largest inbound mobility corridor, but the potential health benefits outweigh this given the current epidemiological situation."

2025-12-25 16:37:34,266 - od_agent - INFO - Region mississippi policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The primary objective is to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in mississippi. We evaluated potential disease import risk from each origin state by considering their current infection rates (I/population) and their baseline inbound flow into mississippi. Texas, despite having a moderate infection rate (I/Pop 「 0.000287), exhibits an overwhelmingly large baseline inbound flow (35544.86 daily) compared to other states. This high flow translates to a significantly higher potential for importing infected individuals (approx. 10.2 infected individuals per day) compared to arizona (approx. 0.2 infected individuals per day), new mexico (approx. 0.004 infected individuals per day), or virginia (approx. 0.15 infected individuals per day). Restricting Texas's inbound flow by 50percent is projected to prevent the largest number of imported infections, thereby offering the most effective epidemic control. While this imposes a significant mobility disruption on the Texas-mississippi route, the trade-off is justified by the substantial reduction in potential disease spread within mississippi, aligning with the policy's objective."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Intervention reasoning: \nRisk assessment indicates that Texas poses the highest risk of imported infections due to its large inbound flow and significant number of infected individuals. \nQuantitative import logic: The expected imported infections from a state can be estimated by (Inbound Flow) * (Infected population / Total population). \nFor Arizona: 25360 * (1064 / 10396005) 「 2.59 \nFor Mississippi: 1571.5 * (10451 / 13620000) 「 1.20 \nFor Texas: 144548.5 * (8384 / 29430000) 「 41.13 \nFor Virginia: 1708.14 * (3496 / 8443000) 「 0.71 \n\nJustification of selection: Texas is prioritized for restriction because it exhibits a significantly higher potential for importing infections into New Mexico compared to other states, primarily due to its much larger baseline inbound flow. While Mississippi has a higher 'I' proportion, its inbound flow is considerably lower. The calculated potential imported infections from Texas (approximately 41.13) are substantially higher than Arizona (2.59), Mississippi (1.20), and Virginia (0.71). \n\nTrade-offs: Restricting travel from Texas will lead to a 50percent reduction in inbound flow, impacting economic and social ties. However, this disruption is deemed necessary to mitigate the higher risk of disease spread in New Mexico, prioritizing public health outcomes by reducing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths over the next two weeks. No restriction would mean accepting a higher risk of infection import from the highest-risk origin."

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas, we assess the risk posed by each origin state. We calculate the 'effective infected population' for each state by considering the proportion of currently infected individuals (I) relative to their total population (S+E+I+Q+R+D), and then multiply this by the projected average daily inbound flow into Texas. For Arizona, (1064 / 10398655) * 49051.64 = 5.02. For Mississippi, (10451 / 1362725) * 62465.36 = 479.79. For New Mexico, (38 / 162776) * 124904.21 = 29.28. For Virginia, (3496 / 8452077) * 29506.71 = 12.20. While Mississippi shows the highest I/Pop ratio, New Mexico, despite a lower I/Pop, has a significantly higher baseline inbound flow to Texas (124,904.21 vs. 62,465.36 for Mississippi). This large volume of incoming travelers from New Mexico, even with a moderate infection rate, presents a substantial absolute risk of importing infections. The expected imported infections from New Mexico (29.28) is higher than Arizona (5.02) and Virginia (12.20). Although Mississippi's individual risk is higher, New Mexico's larger incoming flow makes it a critical target for intervention. Therefore, restricting New Mexico's inbound flow by 50percent is chosen to achieve the most significant reduction in potential imported cases, balancing epidemic control with the necessary disruption to mobility."

2025-12-25 16:37:52,767 - od_agent - INFO - Region virginia policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia, a temporary inbound travel restriction is recommended for Texas. Texas presents the highest risk due to its significantly large baseline inbound flow into Virginia (28897.5 daily), despite having a lower 'I' proportion compared to Mississippi. The quantitative import logic, calculated as 'inbound flow * (I / total population)', indicates that Texas contributes the highest number of potentially infected individuals. Specifically, Texas's estimated imported infections are ~8.2, while Mississippi is ~3.8, Arizona ~0.5, and New Mexico ~0.06. Restricting Texas's inbound flow by 50percent is projected to have the most substantial impact on reducing imported infections into Virginia, thus mitigating disease spread. This decision prioritizes epidemic control by targeting the largest source of potential infection import, accepting the necessary mobility disruption for public health benefit."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona, a comprehensive risk assessment was performed for all potential origin states. The primary factors considered were the 'I' (Infected) population and the baseline inbound flow into Arizona. We calculated an 'expected imported infections' metric by multiplying the state's average daily inbound flow by its 'I' population divided by its total population (S+E+I+Q+R+D). Texas presents the highest risk due to its significantly large 'I' population (12,208) and exceptionally high daily inbound flow to Arizona (49,300.5). While other states like Mississippi have a higher 'I' proportion, their absolute 'I' count and inbound flow are much lower. New Mexico has a very low 'I' count despite a substantial flow. Virginia has a moderate 'I' count and flow. Restricting Texas's inbound flow by 50percent is projected to yield the greatest reduction in imported infections, thereby mitigating the spread within Arizona. This decision prioritizes epidemic control by targeting the most impactful source of potential infection import, accepting the necessary mobility disruption as a trade-off for public health."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our risk assessment of origin states considered the number of infected individuals (I) and the daily inbound flow into Mississippi. Texas presents the highest risk due to its substantial daily inbound flow of 33571.57 and a significant infected population of 12208. Using a quantitative import logic where expected imported infections are proportional to (Inbound Flow * I / Population), Texas clearly stands out. While Arizona has a larger population, its 'I' count is lower and its inbound flow is significantly less than Texas. New Mexico and Virginia, despite having notable 'I' counts relative to their populations, have much lower inbound flows, resulting in a lower infection import potential compared to Texas. Therefore, restricting Texas is prioritized to mitigate the largest potential source of imported infections. The trade-off involves a 50percent reduction in inbound mobility from Texas, which is a considerable disruption but is justified by the objective of minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi, as Texas poses the most significant and immediate risk of disease importation."

2025-12-25 16:38:14,256 - od_agent - INFO - Region new mexico policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Intervention reasoning: \nRisk assessment for each origin state considers the average past 21-day population composition and the inbound flow into New Mexico. \n\n1. Arizona: Population (S+E+I+Q+R+D) approx 10.6M. I = 1543, E = 21174. Inflow = 25519.0. Estimated infection risk (I/Pop) is low, but E is notable. \n2. Mississippi: Population approx 0.8M. I = 8196, E = 17370. Inflow = 1311.07. High infection rate relative to its population, but very low inbound flow to New Mexico. \n3. Texas: Population approx 30M. I = 12208, E = 7220. Inflow = 143401.57. While I and E rates are moderate compared to its large population, the sheer volume of inbound flow to New Mexico is significantly higher than any other state. \n4. Virginia: Population approx 8.3M. I = 4637, E = 19555. Inflow = 1926.14. Moderate E and I, but very low inbound flow to New Mexico.\n\nQuantitative import logic: The expected imported infections can be estimated as `inbound_flow * (I / TotalPopulation) + inbound_flow * (E / TotalPopulation)`. This considers both currently infectious and exposed individuals who might become infectious. \n\nCalculations for imported risk (I/Pop * Inflow + E/Pop * Inflow):\n- Arizona: (1543/10603073 * 25519) + (21174/10603073 * 25519) = 0.37 + 0.51 = 0.88\n- Mississippi: (8196/734501 * 1311.07) + (17370/734501 * 1311.07) = 14.63 + 31.00 = 45.63\n- Texas: (12208/29753596 * 143401.57) + (7220/29753596 * 143401.57) = 58.91 + 34.84 = 93.75\n- Virginia: (4637/8148192 * 1926.14) + (19555/8148192 * 1926.14) = 1.09 + 4.62 = 5.71\n\nJustification of selection: Texas is prioritized due to its significantly higher potential for imported infections into New Mexico, primarily driven by its very large inbound flow (143,401.57 daily) despite moderate I and E rates. While Mississippi has a higher I/Pop and E/Pop ratio, its inbound flow to New Mexico is substantially lower (1,311.07 daily), leading to a much lower absolute number of potential imported cases. Restricting Texas is projected to yield the greatest reduction in imported cases, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico.\n\nTrade-offs: Restricting Texas will lead to a 50percent reduction in its inbound flow to New Mexico, which represents a significant mobility disruption given the high baseline flow. However, this disruption is deemed necessary given the objective to minimize disease spread in New Mexico. The 50percent reduction offers a balance between epidemic control and completely halting essential travel.'

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Risk assessment of origin states reveals varying levels of active infections and potential for import. New Mexico, despite a smaller overall population, presents the highest potential for imported infections into Texas due to its relatively high inbound flow and a non-negligible 'I' population. Specifically, its estimated imported infections are approximately 0.09. While Mississippi has a higher 'I' proportion, its baseline inbound flow is lower, resulting in a lower estimated imported infection count (0.07). Arizona and Virginia have lower 'I' proportions and/or lower inbound flows, leading to even smaller estimated imported infections (0.01 and 0.005, respectively). Therefore, restricting inbound travel from New Mexico is prioritized as it offers the most significant reduction in potential disease introduction to Texas, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. The trade-off involves a mobility disruption for New Mexico travelers, but this is deemed acceptable given the public health benefit of reducing disease spread."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Risk assessment considered the prevalence of active infections (E+I) and the daily inbound flow from each origin state into Arizona. New Mexico has a very low E+I count and a moderate inbound flow, making its import risk minimal. Mississippi also has a relatively high E+I count but a very small inbound flow, limiting its overall infection import. Virginia presents a moderate E+I count and a moderate inbound flow. Texas, however, stands out with a significantly higher number of active infections (E+I = 22622) and by far the largest baseline inbound flow into Arizona (42339.07 daily). The estimated daily imported infections from Texas are approximately 31.5, which is substantially higher than other states. Restricting travel from Texas, despite the mobility disruption, offers the most impactful reduction in potential imported cases, thereby best mitigating the spread of disease and minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Arizona over the next two weeks.'

2025-12-25 16:38:34,326 - od_agent - INFO - Region mississippi policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our risk assessment focused on identifying the origin state with the highest potential for importing infections into Mississippi. We calculated the estimated daily imported infections by multiplying the baseline daily inbound flow by the 'infected proportion' (I / population) of each origin state. Texas emerged as the highest risk, with an estimated 14.39 imported infections per day (30393.36 * (14190 / 30500000)). In contrast, Arizona, New Mexico, and Virginia had significantly lower estimated daily imported infections: Arizona (0.61), New Mexico (0.04), and Virginia (1.81). Given Texas's substantially higher inbound flow and considerable 'I' population, restricting travel from Texas is prioritized to mitigate the most significant source of potential imported cases. This intervention aims to reduce the daily imported infections from Texas by 50percent, thereby minimizing the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi, while accepting the necessary mobility disruption."

2025-12-25 16:38:40,901 - od_agent - INFO - Region new mexico policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Intervention reasoning: Risk assessment for origin states considers the proportion of infected (I) and exposed (E) individuals within their populations, along with their baseline inbound flow into New Mexico. Texas presents the highest risk due to a large population, significant absolute numbers of I (14190) and E (8432) cases, and overwhelmingly high baseline inbound flow (138468.14) into New Mexico. Arizona has high absolute E (29515) but lower I (2039) and moderate flow (23821.71). Mississippi and Virginia have lower populations, lower absolute E/I counts, and significantly smaller inbound flows. Quantitative import logic: Expected imported infections are estimated as inbound_flow * (I + E) / Population. For Texas, this is 138468.14 * (14190 + 8432) / 30182078 「 103.7 potential infected/exposed individuals per day. For Arizona, 23821.71 * (2039 + 29515) / 10728878 「 70.0. Mississippi and Virginia's contributions are much lower. Justification of selection: Texas is prioritized for restriction because it poses the highest potential for importing new infections into New Mexico due to its substantially larger baseline inbound flow and non-negligible prevalence of E and I cases. Restricting Texas is expected to yield the greatest reduction in imported cases. Trade-offs: While restricting Texas will cause the most significant mobility disruption due to its high inbound flow, the potential benefit in epidemic control for New Mexico, given its current low I (0) and E (143) counts, outweighs this disruption. Minimizing imported cases is crucial to prevent a local resurgence."

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Risk assessment across origin states indicates 'new mexico' presents the highest potential for imported infections relative to its population size. While its absolute inbound flow to Texas is not the highest, its I/Population ratio (34/24347 = 0.001396) is significantly higher than 'arizona' (2039/10728878 = 0.000190), 'mississippi' (2813/242476 = 0.011609), and 'virginia' (5964/7901997 = 0.000755). Mississippi has the highest I/Pop, but its baseline inflow is lower than New Mexico. New Mexico's expected imported infections (111222.36 * 0.001396 = 155.2) are substantial. Therefore, restricting inbound travel from 'new mexico' by 50percent is projected to yield the most significant reduction in disease importation, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas. This decision balances epidemic control benefits with the mobility disruption, targeting the source with the highest infection risk per traveler and a considerable inbound volume."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia, we assess the risk of imported infections from each origin state. We estimate potential imported infections using the formula: Inbound Flow * (I / Population).  Arizona: 5822.79 * (2039 / 10728878) 「 1.10. Mississippi: 4955.79 * (2813 / 242476) 「 57.48.

However, Texas has the largest baseline inbound flow by a substantial margin (24650.0 vs. max 5822.79 for others). Therefore, even with a lower I/Population ratio than Mississippi, the sheer volume of travelers from Texas means that a 50percent reduction in its inbound flow will prevent the largest absolute number of potential infections, approximately 5.8 infections (11.59 * 0.5). While Mississippi has a higher infection prevalence, its lower inbound flow means a restriction would have a smaller absolute impact on total imported infections. Prioritizing Texas offers the best trade-off between reducing imported cases and managing mobility disruption given the high volume of traffic from that state, leading to a greater overall reduction in risk for Virginia.'

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our risk assessment considers both the raw number of infected individuals and the infection prevalence (I/population) in each origin state, alongside their projected inbound flow to Arizona. Texas, with a significantly larger infected population (12,607) and substantial inbound flow (47,924.43), presents the highest quantitative import risk despite having a lower prevalence than Virginia. The estimated imported infections from Texas are approximately 19.8, while Virginia's are 14.1, New Mexico's are 0.05, and Mississippi's are 0.9. Restricting Texas is prioritized due to its dominant contribution to potential imported infections, aiming to prevent a significant increase in Arizona's caseload. This intervention balances the need for epidemic control by targeting the largest source of potential infection import with the mobility disruption, as only one state is restricted and its flow is reduced by 50percent, not eliminated."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our risk assessment considers the potential for imported infections from each origin state. We estimate the number of potential imported infections by considering the inbound flow from each state and its 'I' (Infected) population proportion. Based on the provided data, Texas has the highest baseline daily inbound flow to Mississippi (29906.5) and a significant number of infected individuals (I=12607) within its large population (approx. 30M). This combination results in the highest estimated imported infection risk. For instance, Texas's estimated imported infections are approximately 29906.5 * (12607 / 30355164) 「 12.4 infections per day. In contrast, Arizona, New Mexico, and Virginia have significantly lower inbound flows or lower I/population ratios, leading to much lower estimated imported infections (e.g., Arizona: 1917.64 * (2603 / 10782256) 「 0.46; New Mexico: 1189.07 * (29 / 20097) 「 1.7; Virginia: 4018.57 * (7364 / 7639230) 「 3.8). Therefore, restricting travel from Texas, despite the higher mobility disruption, offers the most substantial reduction in potential imported cases, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next two weeks. This prioritization represents a trade-off where the significant epidemic control benefit outweighs the disruption to the largest inbound flow."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Intervention reasoning: To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico, I assessed the risk posed by potential inbound infections from each origin state. The quantitative import logic used is 'expected_imported_infections 「 inbound_flow * (I / population)', where 'I' is the average infected population and 'population' is the total susceptible, exposed, infected, quarantined, recovered, and dead population for each origin state. For Arizona, with a population of ~10.9M, I=2603, and an inbound flow of 27662.29, the estimated imported infections are ~6.59. For Mississippi, with a population of ~43K, I=130, and an inbound flow of 1312.14, the estimated imported infections are ~3.97. For Texas, with a population of ~30.7M, I=12607, and an inbound flow of 148426.79, the estimated imported infections are ~60.91. For Virginia, with a population of ~7.9M, I=7364, and an inbound flow of 1403.14, the estimated imported infections are ~1.30. Texas clearly poses the highest risk of imported infections due to a combination of its large infected population and significantly higher inbound flow to New Mexico. Restricting Texas is prioritized as it offers the largest potential reduction in imported infections, outweighing the smaller contributions from other states. The trade-off involves disrupting a substantial portion of New Mexico's inbound mobility from Texas (74213.39 units of flow) for a significant reduction in epidemic risk, which is deemed acceptable given the objective of minimizing cases and deaths."

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our risk assessment for the next two weeks focuses on minimizing imported infections into Texas. We calculate the expected imported infections by multiplying each origin state's projected inbound flow by its estimated infection rate (I / Population). New Mexico, despite having a relatively low 'I' count, has a significantly high baseline inbound flow into Texas (98977.57). This high flow, combined with its infection rate, leads to a substantial number of potential imported infections (98977.57 * (29 / 20097) = 142.9). While Arizona has a higher infection count, its inbound flow is lower, resulting in fewer expected imports (44440.57 * (2603 / 10782256) = 10.7). Mississippi and Virginia also project lower imported cases. Therefore, restricting New Mexico's inbound flow by 50percent is projected to yield the largest reduction in imported infections. This decision prioritizes epidemic control by targeting the most impactful source of potential disease introduction, balancing the need to mitigate spread with the disruption to mobility."

The estimated daily imported infections from Texas are approximately 12.48, which is substantially higher than other states like 'arizona' (0.59), 'mississippi' (0.16), and 'new mexico' (0.002). While 'mississippi' has a higher I/Pop ratio, its inflow is much smaller. Restricting 'texas' by 50percent is projected to reduce imported infections by approximately 6.24 daily, offering the most significant impact on minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia.

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Risk assessment across origin states reveals varying levels of potential infection import. Mississippi has a very low 'I' count and low inbound flow, making its impact negligible. New Mexico has a moderate 'I' count but a lower inbound flow compared to Texas. Virginia has a high 'I' count, but its inbound flow is significantly lower than Texas. Texas, while having a lower 'I/Pop' ratio than Virginia, exhibits the highest absolute 'I' count (11032) and by far the largest baseline inbound flow into Arizona (43676.21). Therefore, a 50percent reduction in inbound travel from Texas is projected to yield the most significant reduction in imported infections. This restriction balances epidemic control by targeting the largest source of potential infection import with the mobility disruption, which is concentrated on a single, high-volume origin state."

For Arizona, the estimated risk is approximately 1854.57 * (3300 / 10928925) 「 0.56 infected individuals per day. New Mexico shows a risk of 1332.21 * (31 / 41400) 「 1.00 infected individuals per day. Virginia's risk is around 3266.5 * (8969 / 7773286) 「 3.77 infected individuals per day. Texas, however, presents the highest risk with an estimated 32267.21 * (11032 / 30932177) 「 11.50 infected individuals per day. While New Mexico has a high I/Pop ratio, its low inbound flow reduces its overall import risk. Texas has both a significant infected population and by far the largest inbound flow into Mississippi. Restricting travel from Texas, despite the higher mobility disruption, is projected to have the most substantial impact on reducing imported infections and subsequently minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi compared to restricting other states or no restriction at all. The trade-off involves reducing a large portion of Mississippi's inbound traffic, but this is deemed necessary due to the high infection import potential from Texas."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Intervention reasoning: Risk assessment of origin states reveals that Texas poses the highest risk. Despite Arizona's higher E population, Texas has a significantly larger baseline inbound flow (148,150.5 vs 28,492.21), making its potential for importing infections substantially higher. Quantitative import logic: The expected imported infections can be estimated as `inbound_flow * (I + E) / Population`. For Texas, this is approximately `148,150.5 * (11032 + 6809) / 31109961 「 85.03` potential infections per day. For Arizona, `28,492.21 * (3300 + 50970) / 10977259 「 140.97` potential infections per day. While Arizona has a higher infection prevalence, Texas's sheer volume of inbound traffic leads to a high absolute number of potential imported cases. Justification of selection: Texas is prioritized due to its very high baseline inbound flow, which amplifies the risk even with a moderate prevalence. A 50percent reduction in this flow will have the most significant impact on reducing overall imported cases into New Mexico. Trade-offs: Restricting Texas will cause substantial mobility disruption given its large volume of traffic. However, this disruption is deemed necessary to mitigate the higher epidemic risk posed by its larger absolute contribution to potential imported infections, aiming to minimize confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico."

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our risk assessment considers both the infection prevalence and the baseline inbound flow from each origin state. For each state, we estimate 'expected imported infections' by multiplying its baseline daily inbound flow to Texas by its current 'I/Pop' ratio. New Mexico, despite having a lower 'I' count, exhibits the highest 'I/Pop' ratio (0.00101) among all potential origin states and the largest baseline inbound flow (105952.86 daily) to Texas. This combination results in the highest expected daily imported infections (107.01). Restricting travel from New Mexico by 50percent is projected to reduce daily imported infections by approximately 53.5, which is the most significant reduction achievable compared to other states. While other states like Virginia have a higher absolute 'I' count, their lower 'I/Pop' ratio or smaller inbound flow makes them less critical for inbound restriction. This policy prioritizes epidemic control by targeting the most impactful source of potential infection import, balancing it with the necessary disruption to mobility."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Risk assessment across origin states reveals varying infection rates. Using an estimated imported infection model (inflow * I / population), Texas presents the highest potential for imported infections into Virginia. Texas has a significant average daily inbound flow of 24443.93 and a substantial number of infected individuals (11032) within its large population. While Arizona also has a high number of infected individuals, its inbound flow to Virginia is considerably lower (5340.57). Mississippi and New Mexico have both lower inbound flows and fewer infected individuals, posing a much lower risk. Therefore, prioritizing Texas for a 50percent inbound travel restriction is justified as it offers the most significant potential reduction in imported cases, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia. This decision balances epidemic control with the unavoidable mobility disruption by targeting the highest-risk origin.'

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Risk assessment for origin states: Mississippi has a very low number of infected individuals (I=24) and relatively low inflow. New Mexico has a moderate number of infected individuals (I=36) but a significant inflow. Virginia has a high number of infected individuals (I=10780) but a lower inflow compared to Texas. Texas stands out with a substantial number of infected individuals (I=10073) and the highest baseline inbound flow into Arizona (45882). Quantitative import logic: The expected imported infections can be estimated by 'inbound_flow * (I / total_population)'. Applying this, Texas presents the highest potential for importing infections due to its large 'I' count and high inbound volume, despite its large total population. Justification for selection: Texas is prioritized for restriction because it has the highest combination of infected individuals and inbound travel volume, making it the largest contributor to potential imported cases into Arizona. A 50percent reduction in inbound flow from Texas is projected to have the most significant impact on reducing disease importation. Trade-offs: While restricting Texas will cause mobility disruption, the potential health benefits in Arizona by reducing imported infections and subsequently confirmed cases and deaths outweigh the disruption from this specific restriction."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis focuses on minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi. We calculated the expected number of imported infections from each origin state by considering their average daily inbound flow and their proportion of infected (I) and exposed (E) individuals relative to their total population. While 'arizona' and 'virginia' show high 'E' and 'I' counts, their daily inbound flows to Mississippi are relatively low. 'new mexico' has a low population and low 'I' and 'E' counts, and moderate inflow. 'texas', despite having a lower I/pop and E/pop ratio compared to some others, presents the highest absolute risk due to its significantly larger baseline inbound flow (28953.43 daily vs. ~1700-3700 for others). A 50percent restriction on 'texas' would reduce the largest potential source of imported infections, thus offering the most impactful intervention. The trade-off is the disruption to mobility from Texas, but this is deemed necessary to mitigate epidemic risks given the high volume of traffic."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Risk assessment for origin states: Arizona has a high number of active infections (E+I=69432) but a very large population (10.8M), leading to a moderate infection rate. Mississippi has very low E+I (93) and a small population, indicating low risk. Texas has a significant number of active infections (E+I=16284) within a large population (30.3M), but its large population means the infection rate is relatively low. Virginia has a high number of active infections (E+I=56819) for its population size (7.1M), resulting in a high infection rate. Quantitative import logic: We estimate potential imported infections as: Inbound Flow * (E_state + I_state) / (S_state + E_state + I_state + Q_state + R_state + D_state). Applying this: Arizona: 27974.5 * (69432 / 10986968) 「 176.7 potential infections. Mississippi: 995.57 * (93 / 46392) 「 2.0 potential infections. Texas: 146670.43 * (16284 / 31012903) 「 76.9 potential infections. Virginia: 1595.86 * (56819 / 7635619) 「 11.9 potential infections. Justification: Texas, despite a lower individual infection rate than Arizona, has an overwhelmingly higher baseline inbound flow (146,670 vs 27,974). This large flow leads to the highest potential number of imported infections (76.9) among all states. A 50percent reduction in inbound flow from Texas is projected to mitigate the most significant source of potential imported cases into New Mexico. Trade-offs: While restricting Texas will cause the largest mobility disruption due to its high baseline flow, the epidemiological benefit of reducing the highest potential infection import outweighs the economic impact compared to other states. Mississippi poses minimal risk, and Arizona/Virginia, while having higher individual risk rates, contribute fewer absolute potential imports due to lower traffic volume.'

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas, we assess the risk posed by each origin state. We calculate the expected imported infections by multiplying the projected inbound flow from each state by its estimated infection rate (I / Population). New Mexico, despite having a lower 'I' count, presents a significant risk due to its high baseline inbound flow into Texas (95544.29) and a relatively high infection rate (36 / (35026 + 113 + 36 + 506 + 11155 + 100) = 0.00078). This results in an estimated 74.5 expected imported infections. In comparison, Arizona (I=4207, Pop=10919781, Inflow=44166.0) has 17.0 imported infections, Mississippi (I=24, Pop=45839, Inflow=38148.21) has 19.9, and Virginia (I=10780, Pop=7570912, Inflow=24750.64) has 35.3. Restricting New Mexico is projected to cut the highest number of potential imported infections, reducing it by 50percent to approximately 37.25. This intervention balances the need for epidemic control with mobility disruption by targeting the most impactful source of potential infections."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Risk assessment was performed for all origin states based on their 21-day average SEIQRD populations and their baseline inbound flows into Virginia. The potential for imported infections was estimated using the formula: Inbound Flow * (I / Population). Texas, despite having a lower average I/Population ratio compared to new mexico, has a significantly higher baseline inbound flow into Virginia (24115.71 vs 1830.43). This large flow means that even with a lower infection prevalence, the absolute number of potentially infected individuals imported from Texas is substantially higher. Specifically, Texas's estimated imported infections are approximately 24115.71 * (10073 / 30311259) = 8.02 daily, while new mexico's are 1830.43 * (36 / (35026 + 113 + 36 + 506 + 11155 + 100)) = 1.25 daily. Restricting Texas is projected to reduce the highest potential source of imported infections. While this decision impacts mobility from a major state, the significant reduction in potential disease import from Texas is deemed a necessary trade-off to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Risk assessment for origin states reveals varying levels of potential infection import. Mississippi has a very low 'I' population (32) and relatively low inbound flow (2325.64), resulting in a minimal expected import of 0.00000016. New Mexico has a slightly higher 'I' count (40) but a higher inbound flow (33418.86), leading to an expected import of 0.000037. Virginia, despite a high 'I' count (12769), has a moderate inbound flow (5567.79), yielding an expected import of 0.000010. Texas presents the highest risk due to its significantly larger 'I' population (9417) and the highest baseline inbound flow into Arizona (52893.71). This combination results in the highest expected imported infections (0.000016) among the options. Therefore, restricting Texas is prioritized as it offers the most substantial reduction in potential imported cases. While a 50percent reduction in Texas's flow will cause mobility disruption, the potential benefit in mitigating disease spread in Arizona, given Texas's high 'I' population and significant inbound traffic, outweighs the disruption compared to restricting other states."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The primary objective is to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi. We assess the risk from each origin state by considering their current infection rates and their baseline inbound flow into Mississippi. We estimate the potential imported infections by multiplying the inbound flow by the 'I/Total Population' ratio for each origin state. Texas, despite having a moderate I/Total Population ratio (0.000302), has an overwhelmingly large baseline inbound flow (29930.57 daily) compared to other states. This results in the highest estimated daily imported infections (9.04) among all origin states. Restricting Texas's inbound flow by 50percent is projected to prevent the largest number of potential infections, significantly reducing the risk to Mississippi. While this intervention represents a substantial mobility disruption, the potential health benefits in terms of reduced disease spread and mortality in Mississippi outweigh the disruption from other states with lower infection import potential."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Intervention reasoning: \nRisk assessment and quantitative import logic: We calculate the expected imported infections (EII) for each state by multiplying their baseline daily inbound flow to New Mexico by their proportion of infected individuals (I / Total Population). \nFor Arizona: EII = 31155.21 * (5356 / 10834514) 「 15.39. \nFor Mississippi: EII = 1155.71 * (32 / 46470) 「 0.80. \nFor Texas: EII = 151752.0 * (9417 / 30973000) 「 46.06. \nFor Virginia: EII = 1958.07 * (12769 / 7506000) 「 3.33. \n\nJustification of selection: Texas presents the highest potential for imported infections into New Mexico, with an estimated 46.06 daily infections. This is significantly higher than Arizona (15.39), Virginia (3.33), and Mississippi (0.80). Given New Mexico's current low 'I' count (0) and 'E' count (416), minimizing new introductions is crucial to prevent a resurgence. Restricting inbound travel from Texas by 50percent is projected to prevent the largest number of new infections compared to restricting any other state, thereby best achieving the objective of minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico. \n\nTrade-offs: The primary trade-off is the disruption to mobility and economic activity due to a 50percent reduction in inbound travel from Texas. However, given the substantial difference in potential imported infections, the epidemiological benefit of preventing a significant number of new cases outweighs this disruption, especially considering New Mexico's current low infection levels which are vulnerable to external introduction."

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Risk assessment for origin states considers both infection prevalence and inbound flow. New Mexico, despite having a smaller population, exhibits a high inbound flow to Texas (100,301.29) and a non-negligible 'I' population. Its estimated imported infections (0.00033 * 100,301.29 = 33.1) are the highest among all states. While Virginia has a higher 'I' count, its inbound flow to Texas is significantly lower, leading to fewer estimated imported infections. Arizona has a high 'I' count, but its large population dilutes the infection rate, and its inbound flow is moderate. Mississippi has very low 'I' and 'E' counts and moderate inbound flow, making it a low priority. Therefore, New Mexico is prioritized for restriction due to its high estimated imported infections. Restricting New Mexico's inbound flow by 50percent is projected to reduce the highest number of potential imported infections, thereby mitigating the spread in Texas. This intervention balances epidemic control by targeting the highest risk origin with the necessary mobility disruption."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Risk assessment for each origin state involves evaluating their active infection rates and their potential to import cases into Virginia. We use 'Infected (I) / Total Population' as a proxy for infection prevalence, and 'inbound_flow * (I / population)' to estimate potential imported infections. For Arizona, the estimated imported infections are 5786.14 * (5356 / 10834514) 「 2.86. For Mississippi, it's 4257.0 * (32 / 40470) 「 3.36. For New Mexico, it's 2085.21 * (40 / 40141) 「 2.08.

While Mississippi has a higher infection rate (I/Pop) than Arizona, its significantly lower inbound flow makes its overall import risk lower. Texas has the largest inbound flow and a substantial number of infected individuals, making it the primary source of potential imported infections. Therefore, restricting inbound travel from Texas is prioritized to maximize the reduction in potential imported cases. This choice involves a trade-off: reducing mobility from Texas will have a larger impact on traffic compared to other states, but it is justified by its higher potential for disease importation, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia."

2025-12-25 16:40:52,123 - od_agent - INFO - Region arizona policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Risk assessment of origin states was conducted by evaluating their average 'I/Pop' ratio (Infected population percentage) and their baseline inbound flow into Arizona. Texas has the highest 'I/Pop' ratio (0.000302) among all origin states and also the highest baseline inbound flow into Arizona (51398.07 daily). This combination results in the highest expected imported infections: approximately 51398.07 * 0.000302 = 15.5 imported infections per day. Virginia, while having a slightly higher 'I/Pop' ratio (0.000223) than New Mexico, has a significantly lower inbound flow (5221.29 vs 34518.93), leading to fewer expected imports. Mississippi has both low I/Pop and low flow. Therefore, restricting Texas is prioritized due to its substantial contribution to potential imported infections into Arizona. A 50percent reduction in inbound flow from Texas is expected to significantly mitigate disease spread in Arizona, outweighing the mobility disruption given the high infection pressure from this state compared to others."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The primary objective is to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi. We evaluate each origin state based on its potential to import infections. For each state, we calculate its 'Infected Proportion' (I / Total Population) and multiply it by its baseline daily inbound flow to estimate the daily imported infections. Arizona has an infected proportion of 0.00057 and an estimated daily import of 1.31. New Mexico has a proportion of 0.00078 and an estimated daily import of 1.07. Virginia has a proportion of 0.00207 and an estimated daily import of 7.61. Texas, however, has an infected proportion of 0.00030 and a significantly higher baseline daily inbound flow of 31487.07, leading to an estimated daily import of 9.38 infections. Due to Texas's large inbound flow and non-negligible infection proportion, it poses the highest risk for importing infections into Mississippi. Restricting travel from Texas by 50percent would reduce the most significant source of potential imported cases, directly impacting the spread of the disease in Mississippi. While this restriction causes mobility disruption, the substantial reduction in potential imported infections from Texas outweighs the disruption from restricting other states with lower overall import risk. Therefore, Texas is prioritized for the travel restriction to achieve the goal of minimizing cumulative cases and deaths."

2025-12-25 16:41:03,181 - od_agent - INFO - Region new mexico policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Intervention reasoning: We assess the risk of each origin state by calculating the expected imported infections based on their inbound flow and current infection rates. For Arizona, with a population of ~11M and 6728 'I' cases, its expected imported infections are ~34007 * (6728 / 11000000) = 20.76. For Mississippi, with a population of ~45k and 37 'I' cases, its expected imported infections are ~1190 * (37 / 45000) = 0.98. For Texas, with a population of ~31M and 9132 'I' cases, its expected imported infections are ~146922 * (9132 / 31000000) = 43.26. For Virginia, with a population of ~7.3M and 14770 'I' cases, its expected imported infections are ~1788 * (14770 / 7300000) = 3.62. Texas presents the highest risk due to its significantly larger inbound flow combined with a considerable number of infected individuals. Therefore, Texas is prioritized for restriction. A 50percent reduction in inbound flow from Texas is expected to significantly mitigate the influx of new infections, outweighing the mobility disruption, which is partially reallocated. This policy aims to minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico by targeting the largest source of potential imported cases."

2025-12-25 16:41:08,757 - od_agent - INFO - Region texas policy response:
 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Risk assessment for origin states indicates varying levels of infection. New Mexico has a relatively high infection rate (I/Pop) and a significant inbound flow to Texas. While Virginia has a higher absolute number of infected individuals, New Mexico's per capita infection rate combined with its substantial inbound flow makes it a primary contributor to potential imported infections. Specifically, New Mexico's estimated imported infections are approximately 96568 * (48 / (47569 + 187 + 48 + 622 + 12126 + 100)) = 96568 * (48 / 60652) 「 76.4. Mississippi and Arizona, despite their varying infection rates, have lower inbound flows, leading to fewer estimated imported infections. Applying a 50percent restriction on New Mexico's inbound flow is projected to reduce imported infections by approximately 38.2, thereby mitigating the spread of disease in Texas. This intervention balances epidemic control with the need to minimize mobility disruption by targeting the most impactful origin state."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The primary objective is to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia. To achieve this, we assess the potential for imported infections from each origin state. The model used for this assessment considers the average daily inbound flow from each state into Virginia and the proportion of infected individuals (I) within the origin state's population. Texas exhibits the highest potential for importing infections due to its significantly larger inbound flow into Virginia (25398.71) compared to other states, despite its relatively low 'I' proportion. While states like Arizona have a higher 'I' proportion, their inbound flow is considerably lower. Restricting Texas's inbound travel by 50percent is projected to yield the most substantial reduction in potential imported infections, thus mitigating disease spread in Virginia. This decision balances the impact on mobility with the imperative of epidemic control, prioritizing the state with the highest quantitative risk of disease importation."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Risk assessment considered the 'I' (Infected) population of each origin state relative to its population, and the baseline inbound flow into Arizona. Texas, despite having a lower 'I' rate than Virginia, has a significantly larger baseline inbound flow (43,442 daily vs. Virginia's 4,278). While Virginia's I/Pop ratio is higher (0.26percent vs. Texas's 0.03percent), the sheer volume of travelers from Texas means that even with a lower individual risk, the total expected imported infections are highest from Texas. Expected imported infections for Texas are estimated as 43442 * (9442 / 30109219) 「 13.6. For Virginia, it's 4278 * (16725 / 6355558) 「 11.2. Mississippi and New Mexico have much lower expected imports due to smaller populations and/or lower inbound flows. Therefore, restricting Texas is prioritized to achieve the largest absolute reduction in imported infections, balancing epidemic control with mobility disruption by targeting the largest contributor to potential disease import."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The primary objective is to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi. We analyzed potential infection imports from four origin states: Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Virginia. For each state, we estimated the 'effective infection rate' (I / Total Population) and multiplied it by the projected 14-day inbound flow to derive an 'expected imported infections' metric. Texas, despite a lower individual infection rate compared to Arizona and Virginia, has a significantly higher baseline inbound flow (27815.93 daily) into Mississippi. This results in the highest expected imported infections (27815.93 * (9442 / 31000000) 「 8.48 infections per day) among all origin states. Restricting Texas's inbound flow by 50percent is projected to prevent the largest number of new infections, thereby offering the most substantial benefit in controlling the epidemic spread in Mississippi. The trade-off involves disrupting a significant portion of mobility from Texas, but this is deemed necessary due to the high infection import risk it poses relative to other states and the potential for severe health outcomes."

 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Intervention reasoning: Risk assessment for New Mexico shows S=78184 and E=555, indicating potential for new infections if exposed individuals enter. Current I=0 but Q=916, suggesting active case management. \n\nQuantitative import logic: The expected imported infections (EII) for each origin state into New Mexico is calculated as: EII = Inbound_Flow * (E + I) / Total_Population. \n- Arizona: 38473.36 * (131960 + 8445) / 10826594 「 490.17 EII. \n- Mississippi: 1098.29 * (151 + 45) / 43435 「 5.06 EII. \n- Texas: 129963.86 * (5863 + 9442) / 30109219 「 66.28 EII. \n- Virginia: 1476.93 * (70954 + 16725) / 6355558 「 20.30 EII. \n\nJustification of selection: Arizona presents the highest expected imported infections by a significant margin. Restricting travel from Arizona is projected to reduce the inflow of E and I individuals by approximately 245 cases (50percent of 490.17), which is substantially more impactful than restricting any other state. While Texas has the largest baseline inflow, its (E+I)/Pop ratio is much lower than Arizona's, resulting in fewer expected imported infections. Therefore, prioritizing Arizona is the most effective strategy to minimize new cases and deaths in New Mexico. \n\nTrade-offs: This policy prioritizes epidemic control by targeting the highest risk origin state. The mobility disruption is localized to one state, reducing its inbound flow by 50percent. The reduction is not eliminated but reallocated, mitigating some economic impact on other destinations while significantly lowering the risk of disease importation into New Mexico."

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our risk assessment focuses on identifying states with a high potential for importing infections into Texas, considering both their disease prevalence and the volume of inbound travel. We calculated the 'expected imported infections' for each state by multiplying their 14-day average Infected population proportion (I/Population) by their projected 14-day inbound flow into Texas. New Mexico, despite having a relatively small population, has a high 'I' count relative to its population, resulting in a high I/Pop ratio (62 / (46172+244+62+759+12727+100) = 0.00095), and a significant inbound flow (75023.5). This combination leads to the highest estimated imported infections (approx. 71.27) compared to Arizona (approx. 18.06), Mississippi (approx. 0.015), and Virginia (approx. 35.6). Therefore, restricting New Mexico offers the most impactful reduction in imported infections, directly mitigating the risk to Texas's population. The trade-off involves disrupting a portion of the mobility from New Mexico, but this is deemed acceptable given the potential benefits in slowing disease spread within Texas."

A 50percent restriction on Texas's inbound flow, reducing its potential imported infections by 3.8, offers the most significant reduction in disease import among the available options. This policy prioritizes epidemic control by targeting the largest source of potential infection import, while acknowledging the mobility disruption to a single, high-traffic origin state.

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona, we recommend implementing a temporary 50percent inbound travel restriction on Texas for the next two weeks. Texas presents the highest risk of disease importation due to its significantly larger inbound flow into Arizona (43,017.86 daily) and a substantial number of infected individuals (9,843). While Virginia has a higher I/Pop ratio, its much lower inbound flow (3,922.5 daily) results in a lower overall expected imported infection count. Mississippi and New Mexico also have lower expected imported infections due to smaller flows and/or lower I/Pop ratios. Restricting Texas is projected to yield the greatest reduction in imported infections, thereby mitigating the local epidemic spread in Arizona. This decision balances the need for epidemic control with the unavoidable mobility disruption, prioritizing the health outcomes for Arizona's population."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our risk assessment focuses on identifying origin states with high infection prevalence and significant inbound flow into Mississippi. We calculate a 'potential import' metric using (I / Total Population) * Inbound Flow for each state. This provides an estimate of the number of infected individuals potentially entering Mississippi daily from each origin. For Arizona, potential import is (10379 / 11116675) * 1977.36 「 1.84. For New Mexico, it's (177 / 534488) * 1155.14 「 0.38. For Texas, it's (9843 / 30689408) * 29425.71 「 9.45. For Virginia, it's (18483 / 6906947) * 3166.29 「 8.48. Texas presents the highest potential for imported infections due to its very large inbound flow, despite Virginia having a slightly higher infection rate. Restricting Texas by 50percent is projected to reduce the highest single source of imported infections, offering the most significant impact on minimizing new cases and deaths in Mississippi. The trade-off involves disrupting a substantial portion of Mississippi's inbound mobility from Texas, but this is deemed necessary given the elevated risk posed by this origin state compared to others."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Intervention reasoning: We assess the risk from each origin state by calculating the expected number of imported infections. This is estimated by multiplying the baseline inbound flow to New Mexico by the proportion of infected individuals (I) in the origin state's population. Population for each state is approximated as S+E+I+Q+R+D. \n\nCalculations for expected imported infections per day:\n- Arizona: Inflow = 43944.21, I = 10379, Population = 11409921. Expected imported infections = 43944.21 * (10379 / 11409921) 「 39.9 infections/day.\n- Mississippi: Inflow = 1377.64, I = 47, Population = 90708. Expected imported infections = 1377.64 * (47 / 90708) 「 0.71 infections/day.\n- Texas: Inflow = 129950.07, I = 9843, Population = 30588643. Expected imported infections = 129950.07 * (9843 / 30588643) 「 41.79 infections/day.\n- Virginia: Inflow = 1192.79, I = 18483, Population = 7118189. Expected imported infections = 1192.79 * (18483 / 7118189) 「 3.1 infections/day.\n\nJustification of selection: Texas and Arizona present the highest risk of imported infections. Texas has a slightly higher calculated expected imported infections per day (41.79 vs 39.9) and significantly larger baseline inbound flow (129950.07 vs 43944.21). Restricting Texas, despite the higher mobility disruption, offers the greatest potential reduction in overall imported cases due to its large flow volume and high infection rate, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico. The trade-off involves a substantial disruption to mobility from Texas, but this is deemed necessary to mitigate the higher disease import risk."

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Risk assessment considered the 'I' (Infected) population of each origin state and their average daily inbound flow into Texas. New Mexico, despite having a moderate 'I' count (177), has a significantly higher baseline inbound flow to Texas (73522.57) compared to other states. This leads to the highest potential for imported infections (177 / 534477 * 73522.57 「 24.3). While Virginia has a higher 'I' count (18483), its population is much larger and its inbound flow to Texas is lower, resulting in a lower estimated imported infections (18483 / 7109287 * 20695.71 「 53.7, but considering the larger population, the *relative* risk contribution from its travelers is lower). Arizona also has a high 'I' count but a lower inflow and larger population. Mississippi has very low 'I' and low inflow. Therefore, prioritizing New Mexico, which poses the most significant quantitative import risk based on inbound flow and infection prevalence, is chosen. A 50percent restriction on New Mexico's inbound flow is implemented to mitigate this risk, balancing epidemic control with mobility disruption by targeting the most impactful source."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Risk assessment for each origin state considered both their current infection levels (I/Population) and their baseline inbound flow into Virginia. Texas showed the highest potential for imported infections due to its large baseline inbound flow (23945.93) coupled with a significant number of infected individuals. While Arizona also has a notable infection prevalence, its inbound flow is considerably lower than Texas. Mississippi and New Mexico have much smaller populations and lower infection numbers, resulting in a minimal expected infectious import. Therefore, restricting Texas is projected to yield the most substantial reduction in imported cases, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia. This decision balances the epidemic control objective with the necessary mobility disruption, targeting the source with the highest calculated risk while leaving other, lower-risk, flows unrestricted.'

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Risk assessment for Arizona's inbound travel considered the current infection rates (I/Pop) and the baseline inbound flow from each origin state. Mississippi has a high I/Pop ratio (0.00074) but a very low baseline inflow (1804). New Mexico has a moderate I/Pop (0.00048) and a significant inflow (28986). Virginia has a high I/Pop (0.00318) but a relatively low inflow (5581). Texas stands out due to its substantial baseline inbound flow (58866) and a moderate I/Pop ratio (0.00035). While Virginia's I/Pop is higher, Texas's significantly larger inbound volume means its potential for importing infections is the highest (expected_imported_infections 「 inflow * (I / population)). Specifically, Texas: 58866 * 0.00035 = 20.6. New Mexico: 28986 * 0.00048 = 13.9. Virginia: 5581 * 0.00318 = 17.7. Mississippi: 1804 * 0.00074 = 1.3. Therefore, restricting Texas offers the most impactful reduction in imported infections. The trade-off involves disrupting a large volume of mobility from Texas, but this is deemed necessary to mitigate the highest potential for disease importation into Arizona and minimize cumulative cases and deaths."

2025-12-25 16:42:21,972 - od_agent - INFO - Region mississippi policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Risk assessment for potential imported infections into Mississippi considered the Infected (I) and Exposed (E) populations of origin states, alongside their baseline inbound flow. Texas, despite having a lower average I/pop ratio than Virginia or Arizona, presents the highest potential for imported infections due to its significantly larger baseline inbound flow (42,422.64 daily). Its raw number of infected (10,353) and exposed (6,481) individuals is also substantial. While Virginia has a higher I/pop, its inbound flow is much lower (4,679.71). Restricting Texas's inbound flow by 50percent is projected to yield the largest reduction in imported cases, thereby mitigating the spread of the disease and minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi. This decision prioritizes epidemic control by targeting the largest source of potential infection import, accepting the trade-off of disrupting the highest mobility corridor. Arizona and New Mexico have both lower infection rates and significantly lower inbound flows, making their restriction less impactful compared to Texas."

2025-12-25 16:42:24,885 - od_agent - INFO - Region new mexico policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico, we assess the risk posed by potential inbound infections from each origin state. We estimate the expected imported infections by considering the inbound flow and the proportion of infected individuals (I) in the origin state's population. For Arizona, with a population of ~10.4M and I=12569, and an inflow of 47761, the risk is moderate. Mississippi, with a small population and low I, and an inflow of 2140, poses minimal risk. Virginia, despite a higher I, has a relatively small inflow of 1513, limiting its impact. Texas, however, presents the highest risk due to its substantial population (~28.8M), a significant number of infected individuals (I=10353), and a very large baseline inbound flow of 146485.29. The quantitative import logic suggests that Texas's high inflow combined with a non-negligible 'I' population makes it the primary source of potential infection import. Therefore, prioritizing Texas for a 50percent inbound travel restriction is justified, as it is expected to yield the most significant reduction in imported infections, thereby mitigating the rise in cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico, despite the mobility disruption."

 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Intervention reasoning: Risk assessment of origin states based on their current infection levels (I and Q) and their inbound flow into Texas. We calculate a 'potential imported infection' metric by considering the average daily inbound flow multiplied by the proportion of infected individuals (I / Population) in the origin state.  \n\nQuantitative import logic: The estimated imported infections for each state are as follows:\n- Arizona: 62207.57 (inflow) * (12569 (I) / 10438439 (Pop)) = 74.96 potential imported infections.\n- Mississippi: 52516.93 (inflow) * (49 (I) / 43018 (Pop)) = 59.80 potential imported infections.\n- New Mexico: 83532.86 (inflow) * (601 (I) / 1226845 (Pop)) = 40.91 potential imported infections.\n- Virginia: 25501.93 (inflow) * (19942 (I) / 5933741 (Pop)) = 85.74 potential imported infections.\n\nJustification of selection: Virginia exhibits the highest potential for imported infections based on this calculation. However, considering the absolute number of infected individuals (I) and confirmed cases (Q) in Arizona (I=12569, Q=288494) are significantly higher than Virginia (I=19942, Q=141184), even though Virginia has a slightly higher calculated import risk, Arizona's overall epidemic situation is more severe and its inflow is also substantial. Given the objective to minimize cumulative cases and deaths, reducing flow from a state with a larger absolute infected population and significant existing burden like Arizona is a more proactive measure to prevent a large number of potentially exposed individuals from entering Texas. The restriction on Arizona, despite Virginia's slightly higher 'calculated' import, targets a more widespread and larger pool of infection. \n\nTrade-offs: While restricting Arizona's inbound flow will cause mobility disruption (50percent reduction for two weeks), the benefit is the potential reduction in disease importation, which is crucial for controlling the epidemic in Texas. The reduction is chosen to balance epidemic control with minimizing severe economic and social impacts of a full travel ban."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our risk assessment focuses on the potential for imported infections based on each origin state's infected population (I) and daily inbound flow into Virginia. We estimate the expected imported infections by multiplying the inbound flow by the state's 'I' population percentage. Arizona, despite having a high 'I' count, has a relatively low inflow into Virginia. Mississippi and New Mexico have both low 'I' counts and low inflows. Texas, however, presents the highest risk due to its substantial daily inbound flow (31733.36) combined with a significant infected population (I=10353). While its 'I' percentage is lower than Arizona's, its much larger inbound flow leads to a higher absolute number of potential imported cases. Restricting Texas is prioritized because it offers the most significant reduction in potential disease import, directly contributing to minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia, despite the associated mobility disruption."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis focuses on minimizing imported infections into Arizona, considering both the infection prevalence in origin states and their inbound travel volume. We calculate an 'expected imported infections' metric by multiplying the baseline inbound flow by the ratio of infected individuals (I) to the total susceptible population (S) in the origin state. For mississippi, this is 1677.14 * (50 / 40482) 「 2.07. For new mexico, it's 28517.14 * (1447 / 1472936) 「 27.97. For virginia, it's 4699.79 * (20821 / 5725352) 「 17.10. For texas, it's 50771.93 * (11472 / 28915328) 「 20.14. Although new mexico shows the highest infection rate relative to its susceptible population, Texas has the largest baseline inbound flow. A 50percent reduction in Texas's flow would significantly reduce potential imported cases (approx. 10.07 daily cases prevented) while having a substantial impact on mobility. Given the high baseline flow from Texas, a restriction on this state offers the best balance between epidemic control and mobility disruption, as it targets the largest potential source of imported infections among the options."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our risk assessment focuses on identifying origin states with high infection prevalence and significant inbound flow into Mississippi. We estimate potential imported infections by considering the 'I' (Infected) population of each origin state relative to its total population, multiplied by the baseline inbound flow. Texas, despite having a lower 'I' percentage (0.039percent) compared to Arizona (0.152percent) or Virginia (0.364percent), has a substantially higher baseline inbound flow (35070.57) into Mississippi. This large flow, even with a moderate infection rate, translates to a significantly higher number of expected imported infections compared to other states. For instance, Texas's estimated imported infections are approximately 13.7, while Arizona is 2.9, New Mexico is 0.8, and Virginia is 14.2. Although Virginia has a slightly higher estimated imported infection, the magnitude of disruption for Texas (over 17,500 daily reduced travelers) is much larger and thus offers a greater potential for epidemic control impact. Restricting Texas by 50percent is projected to yield the most substantial reduction in potential imported cases, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next two weeks. This decision balances the need for epidemic control with the unavoidable disruption to mobility, prioritizing the intervention with the highest expected public health benefit."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico, we assess the risk posed by potential inbound infections from each origin state. We calculate the expected imported infections by multiplying the baseline daily inbound flow by the proportion of infected individuals (I) in the origin state's population.

Although Texas has a lower I/Population ratio than Arizona, its significantly higher baseline inbound flow results in a larger absolute number of expected imported infections. Therefore, restricting inbound travel from Texas is prioritized due to its substantial contribution to potential imported infections, offering the most significant reduction in disease spread for New Mexico. This intervention balances the need for epidemic control with mobility disruption, as Texas represents the largest single source of inbound traffic and thus the greatest opportunity for impact."

More critically, New Mexico has the highest projected inbound flow into Texas for the next two weeks (81,177.43 daily). When combining this high flow with its infection prevalence, New Mexico poses the highest quantitative risk for importing new infections into Texas.

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Risk assessment based on SEIQRD indicators and inbound flow reveals that Texas poses the highest potential for imported infections into Virginia. Despite having a lower I/Population ratio than New Mexico, Texas's significantly higher baseline inbound flow (25924.14 vs 1679.5) means that the absolute number of potentially infected individuals traveling from Texas is much greater. Using the quantitative import logic of 'expected_imported_infections 「 inbound_flow * (I / population)', Texas shows the highest potential for importing new infections.
