The trade-off is between reducing a moderate number of infections from a high-flow state versus a higher number of infections from a lower-flow state. Given our objective to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths, reducing the largest inbound flow from Texas, even if its I/Pop ratio is not the highest, provides a significant reduction in overall mobility exposure. While Virginia has a higher I/Pop, the absolute number of infections prevented by halving its smaller flow is less impactful on cumulative cases than the larger reduction in overall exposure from Texas. Therefore, Texas is prioritized due to its substantial inbound flow, leading to a greater overall reduction in potential exposure despite a lower I/Pop ratio compared to Virginia."
