2025-12-25 15:58:33,259 - texas - INFO - Parsed PolicyResponse: policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas, we assess the risk posed by each origin state based on their current infection rates and their baseline inbound flow. We estimate the potential imported infections by multiplying the inbound flow by the ratio of infected individuals (I) to the total susceptible population (S) in the origin state. For arizona, the estimated imported infections are 51114.07 * (551 / 9375462) = 3.00. For mississippi, this is 54660.64 * (6739 / 2233380) = 164.71. For new mexico, it's 119104.57 * (126 / 1258966) = 11.93. For virginia, it's 26530.93 * (2079 / 10955931) = 5.04. While mississippi shows the highest infection rate, new mexico has a significantly larger baseline inbound flow into Texas, making its potential for importing a higher number of infected individuals (11.93) compared to arizona (3.00) and virginia (5.04) a greater concern, despite mississippi's higher I/S ratio. Given the objective to minimize cases and deaths, and considering the trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption, restricting new mexico's inbound flow, which is the largest by volume, is likely to have a more substantial impact on reducing overall imported cases. The 50percent reduction in flow from new mexico is chosen to mitigate this specific high-volume risk while allowing other states to maintain their baseline mobility."
