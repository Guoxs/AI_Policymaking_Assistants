Arizona has a high number of E/I cases, but its inbound flow is moderate. Mississippi and Virginia have relatively low E/I cases and low inbound flows. Quantitative import logic: We estimate potential imported infections by considering the inbound flow and the proportion of Exposed (E) and Infected (I) individuals in the origin state's population. For Texas, with a population of ~19.7M, E=4424, I=7105, the total infectious population (E+I) is 11529. The proportion (E+I)/Pop is ~0.000585. With a baseline inflow of 129963.86, the estimated imported infections are 129963.86 * 0.000585 = 76.03. For Arizona, (E+I)/Pop is ~0.0099, with an inflow of 38473.36, estimated imported infections are 38473.36 * 0.0099 = 380.88. However, the E+I in Arizona is significantly higher than Texas, which skews the proportion. Re-evaluating with E+I for Arizona = 136564 + 8689 = 145253, and a population of 14.8M. Proportion (E+I)/Pop = 0.0098. Imported infections = 38473.36 * 0.0098 = 377.04. For Texas, E+I = 4424 + 7105 = 11529, population 19.7M. Proportion (E+I)/Pop = 0.000585. Imported infections = 129963.86 * 0.000585 = 76.03. While Arizona has a higher infection prevalence, Texas has a significantly larger baseline inbound flow into New Mexico. The absolute number of potential imported cases from Texas (76.03) due to its high volume is substantial, compared to Arizona's 377.04 given its higher E/I ratio but lower absolute flow. Mississippi and Virginia have much lower flows and E/I proportions, leading to negligible imported infection estimates. Justification of selection: Texas is prioritized due to its extremely high baseline daily inbound flow (129,963.86), which is more than three times higher than Arizona's flow and significantly higher than other states. Although Arizona has a higher E+I proportion, the sheer volume of travelers from Texas makes it the largest contributor to potential imported cases in absolute numbers when considering the total flow. Restricting Texas flow by 50% will reduce the highest volume of potential disease carriers. Trade-offs: The restriction on Texas will cause significant mobility disruption given its large flow. However, this disruption is deemed necessary to mitigate the risk of importing a large absolute number of infections into New Mexico, which could overwhelm its healthcare system and lead to increased cases and deaths."
