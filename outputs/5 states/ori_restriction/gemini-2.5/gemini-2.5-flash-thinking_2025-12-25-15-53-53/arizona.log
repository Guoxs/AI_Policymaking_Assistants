Although Mississippi has a higher 'I' count relative to its population, its inbound flow to Arizona is much lower. New Mexico has the lowest 'I' count and a moderate inbound flow. Virginia has a substantial 'I' count but a lower inbound flow compared to Texas.  Quantitative import logic: We estimate potential imported infections by multiplying the projected 14-day inbound flow by the 'I' population ratio (I/Population) for each origin state. Texas, with its large inbound flow (57282.5) and a significant 'I' population (5400 / 26133186), projects the highest number of imported infections into Arizona. Mississippi's higher I/Pop ratio is offset by its very low inbound flow. Justification of selection: Texas is prioritized for restriction because it has the highest combination of baseline inbound traffic to Arizona and a notable number of infected individuals. A 50% reduction in its inbound flow is expected to yield the most significant reduction in imported infections compared to restricting other states. Trade-offs: Restricting Texas will lead to a considerable mobility disruption due to its large baseline flow. However, given its high potential for importing infections, this disruption is deemed necessary to mitigate the spread of the disease and minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona, which is our primary objective."

This substantial mobility volume means that even a moderate infection rate in Texas translates into a much higher absolute number of potentially infected individuals entering Arizona. Specifically, Texas's estimated imported infections are ~16 compared to Virginia's ~12. While Mississippi and New Mexico have higher I/Pop ratios, their inbound flows are considerably smaller, leading to negligible estimated imports. Restricting Texas's flow by 50% is projected to prevent the largest number of new infections compared to restricting any other single state, thus minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Arizona. This intervention balances the need for epidemic control with the disruption to mobility, targeting the most impactful origin state."

Mississippi has a very low number of infected individuals (I=46) and a low total population, resulting in a low infection rate and low expected imported infections despite a relatively high inflow. New Mexico has a moderate infection rate and a significant inbound flow, leading to a notable expected import. Virginia, while having a high number of infected individuals (I=37118) and a large population, has a relatively low inbound flow to Arizona, which dilutes its overall impact. Texas stands out due to its substantial inbound flow (58865.79) coupled with a significant number of infected individuals (I=7954) and a moderate infection rate (0.00039). This combination makes Texas the primary contributor to potential imported infections, with an estimated 23.01 daily imported infections. Restricting Texas by 50% would reduce the daily imported infections by approximately 11.5. This reduction in imported cases is projected to have the most significant impact on minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona over the next two weeks, outweighing the disruption to mobility compared to other states with lower import risks or lower total inbound volumes. Therefore, prioritizing the restriction of inbound travel from Texas offers the best trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption."
