Risk Assessment: Mississippi presents the highest per-capita risk with approximately 1.88% of its population actively infectious (I+Q), combined with a moderate inbound flow to Virginia. New Mexico has the highest per-capita infection rate (~2.81%) but very low inbound flow. Texas has the largest inbound flow but a lower per-capita infection rate (~0.28%). Arizona shows the lowest risk among all states. 2. Quantitative Import Logic: We calculate expected daily imported infections for each state using the formula: `inbound_flow * (I + Q) / Total_Population`. This yields approximately 17.64 for Arizona, 85.04 for Mississippi, 62.13 for New Mexico, and 74.24 for Texas. 3. Justification of Selection: A 50% restriction on Mississippi's inbound flow would reduce daily imported infections by approximately 42.52 (0.5 * 85.04). This is the largest potential reduction compared to restricting Texas (37.12), New Mexico (31.06), or Arizona (8.82). Prioritizing Mississippi targets the most impactful source of imported infections. 4. Trade-offs: While restricting travel from Mississippi will cause mobility disruption, the significant reduction in imported infections (over 40 cases daily) is crucial for minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia. The economic impact is weighed against the substantial public health benefit of curbing disease spread from the highest-risk, highest-impact source."

While Arizona has a higher I count (10883), its inbound flow into Virginia is much lower (6610.14). Mississippi and New Mexico have both low 'I' counts and relatively low inbound flows, making their import risk minimal. Quantitatively, the estimated imported infections from Texas (23945.93 * (7348 / 18952375) = 9.27 per day) are considerably higher than from Arizona (6610.14 * (10883 / 14023421) = 5.13 per day). Therefore, restricting travel from Texas is prioritized as it offers the most significant reduction in potential disease importation, directly addressing the objective of minimizing cases and deaths in Virginia. This decision balances the need for epidemic control with the minimal disruption to overall mobility, as only one state is restricted."
