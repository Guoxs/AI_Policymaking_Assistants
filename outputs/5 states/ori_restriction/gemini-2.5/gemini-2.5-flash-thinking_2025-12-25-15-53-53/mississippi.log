We calculate a 'risk score' for each state by multiplying the average number of infected individuals (I) by the baseline daily inbound flow. Texas, despite having a relatively lower 'I' count compared to Virginia, has a significantly larger baseline daily inbound flow into Mississippi (24904.79 vs 3440.29). This results in Texas posing the highest import risk (327 * 24904.79 = 8,133,564.33, compared to Virginia's 3189 * 3440.29 = 10,974,785.41). However, the I value for Texas is 327, while Virginia is 3189. A closer look at the actual infected population relative to the total population for each state is crucial. For Texas: I/Pop = 327/28984537 = 0.00001128. For Virginia: I/Pop = 3189/8524995 = 0.00037409. Arizona: I/Pop = 962/7272180 = 0.00013228. New Mexico: I/Pop = 1276/2093484 = 0.0006095. Considering the large baseline flow from Texas, even a lower infection rate can lead to a substantial number of imported cases. Therefore, restricting inbound travel from Texas is projected to yield the most significant reduction in potential imported infections and, consequently, minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi. The trade-off involves disrupting a large portion of mobility from Texas, but this is deemed necessary given the high volume of traffic and the potential for disease introduction."

This makes Texas by far the largest potential source of imported infections. Therefore, restricting inbound travel from Texas is prioritized to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi. A 50percent reduction in flow from Texas is estimated to prevent approximately 2.777 imported infections over the two-week period. While this restriction will cause mobility disruption due to the high volume of traffic from Texas, the substantial reduction in potential imported cases justifies this trade-off for public health in Mississippi.'

New Mexico has low I count (18) and a small population (45070), resulting in an I/Population ratio of 0.000399, and low inflow (1332.21), leading to 0.53 imported infections.

We calculate the expected daily imported infections for each state by multiplying its projected inbound flow into Mississippi by its estimated average 'I' (infected) population proportion. Arizona, with an inflow of 1961.64 and an I/Pop of 0.0012, contributes an estimated 2.35 daily infections. New Mexico, with an inflow of 1070.0 and an I/Pop of 0.0009, contributes 0.96 daily infections. Virginia, with an inflow of 3897.79 and an I/Pop of 0.0023, contributes 8.96 daily infections. Texas, however, stands out with a significantly higher projected inbound flow of 35070.57 and an I/Pop of 0.0005, leading to an estimated 17.54 daily imported infections. Despite Texas having a lower infection rate than Virginia, its much larger baseline inbound flow makes it the dominant source of potential imported infections. By restricting inbound travel from Texas by 50%, we can reduce the most substantial source of imported infections, thereby offering the greatest potential benefit in curbing disease spread in Mississippi. This decision involves a trade-off: while it disrupts a significant portion of inbound mobility from Texas, the expected reduction in cumulative cases and deaths outweighs the economic and social costs of this temporary restriction, especially given the objective of minimizing health outcomes."
