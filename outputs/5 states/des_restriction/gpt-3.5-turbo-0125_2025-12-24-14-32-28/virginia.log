      "restricted_origin": "texas"
      },
  "global_guidance": "Based on the SEIRD indicators and past mobility patterns, the destination state of Texas is selected for a temporary outbound travel restriction from Virginia for the next 2 weeks. Texas has a relatively high average daily inflow from Virginia and has a significant population size, indicating a higher risk of disease spread. By reducing the outbound flow to Texas by 50%, we aim to minimize the potential importation of infections from Virginia. This decision is made to prioritize epidemic control and minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in both states. The trade-off involves disrupting mobility between Virginia and Texas for the next 2 weeks in favor of public health safety."
