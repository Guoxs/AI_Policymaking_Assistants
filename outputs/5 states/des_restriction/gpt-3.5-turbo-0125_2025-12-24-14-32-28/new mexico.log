  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the destination state of Texas is selected for a temporary outbound travel restriction from New Mexico for the next two weeks. This decision is based on a risk assessment using SEIQRD indicators, where Texas has a higher average number of infected individuals compared to the other destination states. By implementing a 50% reduction in outbound flow to Texas, we aim to minimize the potential importation of infections from New Mexico to Texas. The trade-off in mobility disruption is considered necessary to control the spread of the disease and reduce the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in both states."
