2025-12-24 14:32:32,991 - od_agent - INFO - Region arizona policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='In this scenario, the destination state prioritized for a temporary outbound travel restriction is Texas. This decision is based on a risk assessment using SEIRD indicators, where Texas has a relatively high average daily inbound flow from Arizona and a higher number of infected individuals compared to other destination states. By implementing a 50percent reduction in outbound travel to Texas for the next two weeks, we aim to minimize the potential importation of infections from Arizona. This trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption is deemed necessary to reduce the risk of spreading the disease to Texas and mitigate the overall impact on public health in both states.'

2025-12-24 14:32:35,320 - od_agent - INFO - Region mississippi policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='In this scenario, the destination state to prioritize for a temporary outbound travel restriction is Texas. Texas has a relatively high average daily inflow from Mississippi over the past 21 days, indicating a significant potential for disease spread between the two states. By implementing a 50percent reduction in outbound travel from Mississippi to Texas for the next two weeks, we can mitigate the risk of importing infections into Texas while still allowing some mobility for essential travel and economic activities. This decision is made to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths for all states over the full 2-week horizon, considering the trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption.'

This decision is based on a risk assessment using SEIQRD indicators, where Texas has a higher average number of infected individuals compared to the other destination states. By implementing a 50percent reduction in outbound flow to Texas, we aim to minimize the potential importation of infections from New Mexico to Texas.

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='New Mexico is selected for a temporary outbound travel restriction from Texas for the next two weeks. This decision is based on a risk assessment using SEIQRD indicators, where New Mexico has a higher average daily inbound flow compared to other destination states. By reducing the inbound flow from Texas to New Mexico by 50percent, we aim to minimize the potential importation of infections and slow down disease spread. This trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption is justified by the need to prioritize public health and mitigate the risk of increased cases and deaths in both states.'

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Based on the SEIRD indicators and past mobility patterns, the destination state of Texas is selected for a temporary outbound travel restriction from Virginia for the next 2 weeks. Texas has a relatively high average daily inflow from Virginia and has a significant population size, indicating a higher risk of disease spread. By reducing the outbound flow to Texas by 50percent, we aim to minimize the potential importation of infections from Virginia. This decision is made to prioritize epidemic control and minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in both states. The trade-off involves disrupting mobility between Virginia and Texas for the next 2 weeks in favor of public health safety.'
