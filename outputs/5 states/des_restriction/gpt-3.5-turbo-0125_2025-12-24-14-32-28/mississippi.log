      },
  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the destination state to prioritize for a temporary outbound travel restriction is Texas. Texas has a relatively high average daily inflow from Mississippi over the past 21 days, indicating a significant potential for disease spread between the two states. By implementing a 50% reduction in outbound travel from Mississippi to Texas for the next two weeks, we can mitigate the risk of importing infections into Texas while still allowing some mobility for essential travel and economic activities. This decision is made to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths for all states over the full 2-week horizon, considering the trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption."
