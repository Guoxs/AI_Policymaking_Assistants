{
  "weekly_policy": {
      "restricted_origin": "texas"
      },
  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the destination state prioritized for a temporary outbound travel restriction is Texas. This decision is based on a risk assessment using SEIRD indicators, where Texas has a relatively high average daily inbound flow from Arizona and a higher number of infected individuals compared to other destination states. By implementing a 50% reduction in outbound travel to Texas for the next two weeks, we aim to minimize the potential importation of infections from Arizona. This trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption is deemed necessary to reduce the risk of spreading the disease to Texas and mitigate the overall impact on public health in both states."
