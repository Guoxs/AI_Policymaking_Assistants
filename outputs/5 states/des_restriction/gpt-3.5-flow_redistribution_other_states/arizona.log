  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the destination state of Texas is selected for a temporary outbound travel restriction from Arizona for the next two weeks. 

1. Risk assessment: Texas has a higher average daily inbound flow from Arizona compared to the other destination states, indicating a higher level of interaction. Additionally, Texas has a larger infected population, which increases the risk of importing infections to Arizona.

2. Quantitative import logic: The expected imported infections can be approximated by the formula: expected_imported_infections ¡Ö inbound_flow * (I / population). By applying this logic, it is evident that Texas has a higher potential to contribute to imported infections in Arizona.

3. Justification of selection: Texas is prioritized over the other destination states due to its higher inbound flow and infected population. Restricting outbound travel to Texas can help reduce the risk of disease spread and minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths for all states over the 2-week horizon.

4. Trade-offs: While the restriction may cause mobility disruptions, the primary goal is to prioritize epidemic control and reduce the burden of the disease. By implementing this temporary restriction, we aim to contain the spread of the virus and protect public health."
