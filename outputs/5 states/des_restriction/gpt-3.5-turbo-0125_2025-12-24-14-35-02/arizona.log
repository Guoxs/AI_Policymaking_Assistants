  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, I recommend implementing a temporary outbound travel restriction from Arizona to New Mexico for the next two weeks. 

1. Risk assessment: New Mexico has a relatively high average daily inbound flow from Arizona compared to other destination states. Considering the SEIRD indicators, the potential risk of disease spread from Arizona to New Mexico is significant.

2. Quantitative import logic: The expected imported infections to New Mexico from Arizona can be estimated as inbound flow * (I / population). With the high inbound flow and current infected population in Arizona, the potential for disease transmission to New Mexico is a concern.

3. Justification of selection: New Mexico is prioritized for the restriction over other states due to its higher inbound flow and the potential impact on disease spread. By reducing the outbound flow from Arizona to New Mexico, we aim to minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths for both states.

4. Trade-offs: While implementing the travel restriction may disrupt mobility between Arizona and New Mexico, the temporary measure is crucial to control the spread of the disease and protect public health in both states."
