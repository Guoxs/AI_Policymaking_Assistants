- Risk assessment: Texas has a relatively higher average daily inbound flow from mississippi compared to the other destination states. This indicates a higher risk of importing infections from mississippi to texas.
- Quantitative import logic: By reducing the inbound flow to texas by 50%, we can potentially reduce the number of imported infections from mississippi to texas, contributing to the overall control of the epidemic.
- Justification of selection: Texas is prioritized over the other states due to its higher inbound flow from mississippi and the potential impact on reducing imported infections.

  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the destination state of Texas is selected for a temporary outbound travel restriction from Mississippi for the next two weeks. 

1. Risk assessment: Texas has a relatively high average daily inflow from Mississippi over the past 21 days, indicating a significant level of inter-state mobility. The SEIRD indicators show that Texas has a considerable number of infected individuals, making it a high-risk state for potential disease transmission.

2. Quantitative import logic: The expected imported infections to Texas from Mississippi can be estimated as inbound flow from Mississippi * (I / population). By reducing the outbound flow from Mississippi to Texas, we can potentially reduce the spread of the disease to Texas.

3. Justification of selection: Texas is prioritized over the other destination states due to its high daily inflow from Mississippi and the significant number of infected individuals. By implementing a restriction on outbound travel to Texas, we aim to minimize the spread of the disease and protect public health.

4. Trade-offs: While the restriction may disrupt mobility between Mississippi and Texas, the potential reduction in disease transmission outweighs the temporary inconvenience. It is crucial to prioritize epidemic control and minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths for all states over the full 2-week horizon."
