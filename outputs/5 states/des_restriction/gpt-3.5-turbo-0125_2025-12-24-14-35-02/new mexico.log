  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, I recommend implementing a temporary outbound travel restriction from Texas to minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths for all states over the next two weeks. 

1. Risk assessment:
   Texas has a relatively high number of infected individuals and a large population, indicating a higher risk of spreading the disease through outbound travel. By imposing a 50% reduction in outbound flow, we can potentially mitigate the spread of the virus to other states.

2. Quantitative import logic:
   Expected imported infections  Outbound flow from Texas * (I / population of Texas). By reducing the outbound flow, we can lower the number of expected imported infections in destination states.

3. Justification of selection:
   Texas is prioritized over the other states due to its significant population size, high number of infected individuals, and substantial outbound flow. By restricting outbound travel from Texas, we can have a more significant impact on reducing the overall spread of the disease.

4. Trade-offs:
   Implementing this restriction may disrupt mobility and travel between Texas and other states, potentially affecting economic activities and social interactions. However, the potential benefits of reducing the spread of the virus and protecting public health outweigh the temporary mobility disruption."
