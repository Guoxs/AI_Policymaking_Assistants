  "global_guidance": "Texas is selected for a temporary outbound travel restriction from mississippi for the next two weeks. This decision is based on the following reasoning: 
1. Risk assessment: Texas has a relatively higher number of infectious individuals (I) compared to the other destination states, indicating a higher risk of importing infections into mississippi.
2. Quantitative import logic: The expected imported infections from Texas to mississippi can be approximated as inbound_flow * (I / population), which is relatively higher for Texas compared to other states.
3. Justification of selection: Texas is prioritized over the other states due to its higher risk of spreading infections to mississippi. By implementing a temporary outbound travel restriction, we aim to reduce the potential influx of cases from Texas and minimize the overall impact on public health in mississippi.
4. Trade-offs: While the restriction may disrupt mobility between mississippi and Texas, it is crucial for controlling the spread of the disease and protecting the population of mississippi from a surge in cases and potential strain on healthcare resources."
