### Intervention Reasoning:
1. **Risk Assessment**: Texas has a relatively high average daily inbound flow from New Mexico and a larger population compared to the other destination states. This indicates a higher risk of disease spread through mobility.
2. **Quantitative Import Logic**: The expected imported infections from New Mexico to Texas can be estimated as inbound flow * (I / population), where I represents the number of infected individuals in New Mexico. By reducing the inbound flow, we aim to lower the potential spread of the disease to Texas.
3. **Justification of Selection**: Texas is prioritized over the other destination states due to its higher population and inbound flow from New Mexico, making it crucial to control mobility to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths.
4. **Trade-offs**: While the temporary travel restriction may disrupt mobility between New Mexico and Texas, the aim is to prioritize epidemic control and reduce the risk of spreading the disease to a larger population.

By implementing this temporary outbound travel restriction to Texas, we aim to mitigate the spread of the disease and protect public health in both states."
