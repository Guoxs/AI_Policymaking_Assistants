{

      "restricted_origin": "texas"
      },
  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the state of Texas is recommended to be the origin state for the temporary outbound travel restriction for the next two weeks. 

1. Risk assessment: Texas has a relatively high average daily inbound flow from Virginia and a significant number of confirmed cases and deaths. This indicates a higher risk of disease spread through mobility.

2. Quantitative import logic: The expected imported infections to Texas can be estimated as inbound flow * (I / population), where I represents the number of infected individuals in Texas. By reducing the inbound flow from Virginia, we can potentially slow down the spread of the disease in Texas.

3. Justification of selection: Texas is prioritized over other destination states as it has a higher baseline outbound flow from Virginia and a larger population, making it a critical target for epidemic control measures. By implementing a temporary outbound travel restriction, we aim to reduce the risk of further transmission and mitigate the impact of the epidemic.

4. Trade-offs: While the restriction may disrupt mobility between Virginia and Texas, the potential benefits in terms of reducing disease spread and protecting public health outweigh the temporary inconvenience. This targeted intervention aims to balance epidemic control and minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths for all states over the next two weeks."
