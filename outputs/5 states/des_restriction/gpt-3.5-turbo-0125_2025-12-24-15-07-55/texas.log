{

      "restricted_origin": "new mexico"
      },
  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the destination state of New Mexico is recommended for a temporary outbound travel restriction from Texas for the next two weeks. 

1. Risk assessment:
   New Mexico has a relatively lower population size compared to the other destination states, which may lead to a higher impact of imported infections from Texas. The SEIRD parameters indicate a moderate level of transmission potential in New Mexico.

2. Quantitative import logic:
   The expected imported infections can be estimated as inbound flow from Texas to New Mexico multiplied by the ratio of infected individuals in Texas to the total population of Texas. This indicates a significant potential for disease spread from Texas to New Mexico.

3. Justification of selection:
   New Mexico is prioritized for restriction due to its smaller population size and the potential for a higher impact of imported infections. By reducing outbound travel to New Mexico, the spread of the disease can be mitigated, leading to a decrease in cumulative confirmed cases and deaths.

4. Trade-offs:
   Implementing a temporary outbound travel restriction to New Mexico may disrupt mobility between the two states, but it is crucial for epidemic control to prevent further transmission of the disease and reduce the burden on healthcare systems in both states. This trade-off is necessary to prioritize public health and safety during the ongoing pandemic."
