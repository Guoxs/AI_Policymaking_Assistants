New Mexico, despite having lower infection counts, receives the highest outbound flow, increasing the risk of importing infections from Texas. Arizona and Virginia have higher infection prevalences but receive significantly less flow from Texas, making their import risk comparatively smaller. Mississippi has moderate infection counts but lower flow than New Mexico. Given the 50percent reduction constraint on only one destination, prioritizing New Mexico maximizes the reduction of potential exported infections from Texas by targeting the highest traffic volume route. The reallocation of reduced flow to other states is proportional to their baseline flows, mitigating severe mobility disruption. This approach balances epidemic control by cutting a major transmission route while maintaining overall mobility and economic activities. Continuous monitoring is essential to adapt policies if infection dynamics or mobility patterns change.'

This makes import risk to Mississippi from Texas more consequential. Expected imported infections roughly estimated by inbound flow from Texas to Mississippi (65943) multiplied by Texas infection ratio (3848/20167270 「 0.00019) results in about 12 potential imported infections daily. Mississippi's high active infections and moderate inbound flows suggest restricting outbound travel from Texas to Mississippi by 50% would significantly reduce spread. Other states like New Mexico have lower infections (I=195) despite higher outbound flow, so restriction there yields less benefit. Arizona and Virginia have moderate infections but larger populations diluting impact. Restricting Mississippi balances epidemic control by targeting highest risk import destination, while causing moderate mobility disruption due to mid-level outbound flow. Reallocating reduced flow to lower risk states minimally impacts overall mobility but improves epidemic control."

New Mexico has low infections but very high outbound flow, so restricting there would cause high mobility disruption for less epidemic gain. By selecting Mississippi for a 50% outbound flow restriction from Texas, we reduce potential imported infections proportionally. This reduces spread risk in a high-burden state while reallocating flows to lower risk states maintains mobility. This strategy minimizes cumulative infections and deaths over two weeks by focusing resources on the highest transmission risk corridor. Trade-offs include moderate mobility disruption to Mississippi-bound travel, but overall benefits in slowing epidemic spread justify this targeted approach. No restriction or restricting other states would be less effective in controlling transmission given their infection prevalence and flow patterns."

Texas' outbound flow is moderately sized to Mississippi (27,815 daily). Expected imported infections 「 outbound_flow * (I / population), making Mississippi a significant risk for spreading infections from Texas. Arizona, New Mexico, and Virginia have lower infected ratios or higher populations diluting infection impact.

Although New Mexico has a higher outbound flow, its infected count and ratio are much lower, posing less risk.

By imposing a 50% restriction on travel to Mississippi, we effectively reduce the importation of cases from Texas into a high-risk area, potentially limiting disease amplification there and preventing spillback.
