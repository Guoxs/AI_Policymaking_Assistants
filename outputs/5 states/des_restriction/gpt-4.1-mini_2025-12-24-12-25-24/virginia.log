Reducing outbound flow to Texas by 50% will significantly cut the volume of potentially infectious travelers, thus lowering imported cases. Arizona, Mississippi, and New Mexico have higher infected ratios but much smaller outbound flows, so restricting them yields less impact on total importation.

The expected imported infections to Texas from Virginia, approximated as outbound_flow * (I_virginia / population_virginia), is highest here, making Texas the priority for intervention. By reducing inbound flow from Virginia to Texas by 50%, we lower the risk of spreading infections to a large, relatively more infected population, curbing epidemic growth. Arizona, although having a larger population, has fewer infected individuals and less outbound flow than Texas, making it less critical.

2025-12-24 12:30:47,294 - virginia - INFO - Parsed PolicyResponse: policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Virginia¨s epidemic state shows a significant number of active infections (I=17758) and exposed individuals (E=72038). The main objective is to reduce the export of infections to states where they could cause the greatest incremental epidemic burden. Mississippi stands out due to its small population and very high infected and exposed counts (I=65855, E=131833), making it highly vulnerable to additional imported cases. The expected imported infections to Mississippi from Virginia are moderate, so a 50percent reduction in outbound flow can meaningfully reduce transmission risks. Arizona and Texas, despite having large populations, have lower infected proportions, diluting the relative impact of imported infections. New Mexico¨s low infected count suggests less urgency. Restricting travel to Mississippi minimizes secondary spread risks while maintaining overall mobility to other states, which is crucial for economic and social stability. This targeted approach balances epidemic control and travel disruption, aiming to flatten epidemic curves and reduce deaths in both Virginia and destination states.'

Texas also has a significant number of infected and exposed individuals, so reducing travel there halts a critical transmission route. The expected imported infections can be approximated by the product of outbound flow and infection prevalence in Virginia; hence, halving flow to Texas directly lowers infection exportation.

The outbound flow from Virginia to Texas is also the largest (20695.71), so reducing this flow by 50% could significantly reduce imported infections. Estimated imported infections roughly equal outbound_flow * (I / population), so Texas likely imports the most infections from Virginia. Restricting Texas over other states (Arizona, Mississippi, New Mexico) prioritizes reducing high-risk flows and maximizes impact on lowering spread. The trade-off is moderate mobility disruption due to Texas's high flow, justified by its higher infection risk. This targeted restriction balances epidemic control and mobility needs effectively."

Restricting Texas reduces the highest importation risk while allowing other flows to continue, preserving broader mobility and economic activity. This selective restriction is optimal to minimize cumulative cases and deaths across all states by targeting the highest risk and flow combination without overly disrupting total mobility.

Although Arizona has a higher infected population, the outbound flow from Virginia to Arizona is about 5 times less than to Texas, limiting the potential impact of restriction. Mississippi and New Mexico have relatively higher infection ratios but very low Virginia outbound flows, thus restricting these routes brings minimal epidemic control benefits. The expected imported infections are proportional to outbound flow times the infected fraction in Virginia, making Texas the largest importer. By halving flow to Texas, the imported infection pressure is significantly reduced, lowering secondary transmissions. This targeted restriction avoids widespread disruption, preserves mobility to other destinations, and strategically focuses on the highest risk route. No restriction would miss this opportunity, risking increased spread, while restricting multiple states is not allowed by policy.
