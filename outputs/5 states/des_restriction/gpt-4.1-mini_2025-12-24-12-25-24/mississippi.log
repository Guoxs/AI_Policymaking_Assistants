    "notes": "Texas has a relatively high number of infected individuals (I=26089) compared to other destination states, combined with the largest outbound flow from Mississippi (35590.5). Expected imported infections to Texas from Mississippi are significant given the large flow and infection prevalence. Reducing outbound flow to Texas by 50% will substantially reduce infection export while minimally impacting flows to smaller destinations. Arizona, Virginia, and New Mexico have lower infected counts and/or lower flow volumes, thus less impact on overall epidemic control if restricted. The trade-off favors restricting Texas to achieve maximal reduction in case export with acceptable mobility disruption."
  },
  "global_guidance": "In selecting outbound travel restrictions from Mississippi, the primary goal is to minimize cumulative infections and deaths over the next two weeks by reducing transmission through mobility. Texas is the highest risk destination due to its large infected population (I=26089) and the disproportionately large outbound flow from Mississippi (35590.5 daily), making it the dominant channel for potential infection export. Expected imported infections approximate: outbound_flow * (I / population). Given Texas's higher absolute infected number and flow volume, restricting outbound flow there by 50% will effectively reduce secondary transmission chains. Arizona and Virginia have moderate infected counts but much smaller outbound flows from Mississippi, limiting impact of restrictions there. New Mexico's infected count and flow are both small, yielding minimal benefit from restrictions. Overall, restricting Texas balances epidemic control with mobility preservation, minimizing disruption to essential flows to other states. This targeted approach optimizes infection control while maintaining regional mobility necessary for economic and social activity."

    "notes": "Texas has the highest baseline daily outbound flow from Mississippi (52516.93), making it the largest contributor to potential disease spread. Although Mississippi's infected (I) population is high, Texas has a moderate infected count (23198) but a large susceptible population (5275085). Expected imported infections are proportional to outbound flow times Mississippi's infection ratio, so restricting Texas reduces a significant volume of potential transmission. Arizona, New Mexico, and Virginia have much lower outbound flows, so restricting them yields less impact. Reducing outbound flow to Texas by 50% significantly lowers exportation risk, and the reallocated flow to smaller destinations with lower epidemic severity mitigates impact on mobility. This balances epidemic control by targeting the highest risk flow while minimizing disruption."
  },
  "global_guidance": "Mississippi's high infected and exposed population pose a substantial risk of exporting infections through outbound travel. The key to minimizing epidemic spread is to target restrictions on the destination state that receives the largest flow from Mississippi and has a considerable susceptible population, amplifying the risk of secondary outbreaks. Texas stands out with an outbound flow over 52,000 daily, dwarfing other states, and a large susceptible population, increasing the chance that imported infections seed new cases. Arizona, New Mexico, and Virginia have significantly smaller flows from Mississippi, thus restricting them would have limited effect on overall transmission. Applying a 50% reduction in flow to Texas cuts the largest possible infection export vector, while reallocation of the reduced flow to other states with lower epidemic risk balances economic and social costs. This approach optimizes epidemic control by focusing resources on the highest risk mobility corridor without imposing widespread travel bans that could disrupt essential movement and economic activity. Continuous monitoring of infection trends and mobility patterns is essential to adjust policies dynamically as the epidemic evolves."
