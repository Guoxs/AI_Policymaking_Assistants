Arizona's outbound flow to New Mexico is significant (25837.79 daily), raising risk of importing infections.

Mississippi and Virginia, despite having notable infection counts, have much lower mobility flows from Arizona, making restrictions less impactful. New Mexico has relatively low infection prevalence and moderate mobility, suggesting lower risk. While restricting travel to Texas causes economic and social mobility disruptions, the epidemic control benefits in terms of reducing cumulative cases and deaths justify this focused intervention for the next two weeks. This targeted approach balances epidemic control with mobility preservation by limiting restrictions to a single high-risk destination rather than blanket measures.'

Mississippi and Virginia have smaller infected populations and lower outbound flows, while New Mexico, despite high outbound flow, has much lower infected numbers (I=195).

2025-12-24 12:30:16,698 - arizona - INFO - Parsed PolicyResponse: policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Arizona's epidemic state shows moderate active infections (I=4330) and exposed individuals (E=62572), posing risk of exporting infections to other states. The objective is to reduce potential spread by limiting outbound travel to the destination with the greatest combined risk of infection import and mobility volume. Texas has a sizable infected population relative to other states and receives the highest outbound flow from Arizona (about 44,441 daily). This results in a large expected number of infection transmissions through travel. Mississippi and Virginia exhibit higher infection prevalence but have much lower outbound flow from Arizona, reducing their effective import risk. New Mexico's infection levels are low despite substantial mobility, so restricting it would cause significant mobility disruption with minimal epidemic benefit. Thus, restricting travel to Texas by 50percent for two weeks will likely yield the greatest reduction in cumulative cases and deaths across all states, balancing epidemic control with mobility preservation. This targeted policy reduces outbound flow to Texas while allowing reallocation of reduced trips to lower-risk states, minimizing overall disruption."

    "notes": "Texas has a relatively high number of infected individuals (I=27650) and substantial outbound flow from Arizona (46213.79 daily), leading to a significant risk of exporting infections. Estimated imported infections are roughly proportional to flow times infected ratio, which is highest for Texas among destinations. Mississippi and Virginia have either lower outbound flow or relatively fewer active infections, while New Mexico, despite a large flow, has fewer infected individuals. Reducing outbound flow to Texas by 50% effectively cuts high-risk mobility, reallocating some flow to lower-risk states, thus minimizing overall spread. This approach balances epidemic control by targeting the highest risk link while preserving most mobility and economic activity."

  "global_guidance": "Given Arizona's current infection levels and mobility patterns, the primary concern is the outbound flow to states with both high infection prevalence and significant mobility volume. Texas stands out with a large infected population (I=27650) combined with the highest average outbound flow from Arizona (46213.79), increasing the risk of spreading infections. Mississippi and Virginia have notable infections but lower flows from Arizona, reducing their relative risk. New Mexico has high mobility but lower infected levels, making it less critical. Implementing a 50% reduction in outbound flow to Texas for two weeks reduces the potential export of infections significantly, as imported infections approximately scale with flow times infection prevalence. The restricted flow will be partly reallocated to other states in proportion to baseline mobility, minimizing severe disruption. This targeted policy optimizes the trade-off between controlling epidemic spread and maintaining essential travel and economic activity, as broad restrictions would cause unnecessary economic harm with less epidemiological benefit."
