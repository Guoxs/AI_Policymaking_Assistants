Mississippi and Virginia have higher infection prevalence but much smaller mobility flows. Arizona has a higher number of infected individuals (962) but also a very large population and very high mobility (25816 daily). Restricting outbound flow to Texas reduces a large volume of potential exported infections by 50%, which is significant given the high flow magnitude. The risk import is approximated as flow * (I/population). Texas's lower prevalence but much larger mobility means it likely imports more infections overall from New Mexico if unrestricted. The trade-off favors restricting Texas to reduce total spread, as the disruption affects a major route but avoids multiple smaller restrictions. Reallocating the reduced 50% flow to other states proportionally maintains mobility balance. Thus, restricting Texas outbound flow is optimized for epidemic control while balancing mobility disruption."

Restricting outbound flow to Texas by 50% reduces the absolute number of infected travelers significantly, thereby lowering transmission risks in Texas and downstream states. Arizona, while having a higher infected count, also has large flows but restricting to multiple states is not permitted; Texas provides the best single target for maximal impact. Mississippi and Virginia have smaller flows and thus less impact if restricted. The trade-off balances epidemic mitigation benefits against mobility costs; restricting a single high-volume route is more efficient and less disruptive than multiple minor restrictions.

Arizona and Virginia have moderate infection counts but larger populations, yielding lower prevalence. Restricting outbound flow to Mississippi by 50percent reduces importation risk most effectively relative to mobility disruption, as Mississippi receives only about 1,483 daily travelers from new mexico. The reduction reallocates flow to other destinations proportionally, maintaining overall mobility. This targeted intervention balances epidemic control with mobility needs, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths over two weeks while limiting social and economic disruption.'

Mississippi shows a notably higher infection prevalence (~2.9%) compared to Texas (~0.065%), Arizona (~0.021%), and Virginia (~0.12%). Since imported infections from New Mexico scale roughly with outbound flow times destination infection prevalence, restricting travel to Mississippi reduces a disproportionate share of potentially imported infections. Although Texas receives the largest flow from New Mexico, its low infection prevalence means restricting it yields limited epidemiological gain but larger mobility disruption.

Mississippi shows a notably higher infection prevalence (~2.9percent) compared to Texas (~0.065percent), Arizona (~0.021percent), and Virginia (~0.12percent). Since imported infections from New Mexico scale roughly with outbound flow times destination infection prevalence, restricting travel to Mississippi reduces a disproportionate share of potentially imported infections. Although Texas receives the largest flow from New Mexico, its low infection prevalence means restricting it yields limited epidemiological gain but larger mobility disruption.

  "global_guidance": "The decision to restrict outbound travel from New Mexico to Mississippi is driven by a combined assessment of infection prevalence, population size, and mobility volumes. Mississippi's high number of active infections relative to its population suggests a higher risk of epidemic amplification if additional infected individuals arrive. Although Texas and Arizona receive larger absolute mobility flows, their infection prevalence is lower, reducing the relative risk per traveler. Virginia, despite a sizeable infected population, has low inbound flow from New Mexico, minimizing risk. By halving travel to Mississippi, we reduce potential imported infections proportionally, mitigating spread in a vulnerable state. The reduced flow can be redistributed to states with lower infection rates, balancing epidemic control and economic mobility. This targeted approach optimizes the impact of a single outbound restriction, minimizing overall infections and deaths over two weeks while preserving essential mobility and economic activity in higher-flow states. No restriction would miss this opportunity, risking higher epidemic growth, whereas restricting higher-flow states would cause larger mobility disruption with less marginal epidemiological benefit."

New Mexico's outbound flow to Mississippi is low (1155 daily), so reducing it by 50% minimizes mobility disruption. Expected imported infections to Mississippi from New Mexico are roughly proportional to flow * (I/population), but Mississippi's already extreme epidemic load means restricting travel here can help limit further spread originating from New Mexico. Arizona and Texas have higher outbound flows but lower infection ratios, while Virginia's infection count and flow are moderate. Given the balance between epidemic control and mobility impact, restricting outbound flow to Mississippi is prioritized to reduce high-risk transmission with minimal disruption."

Although New Mexico's outbound daily flow to Mississippi is low (~1155), reducing it by half can significantly limit high-risk transmission chains without heavily disrupting overall mobility. Arizona and Texas have much larger outbound flows from New Mexico, but their infection prevalence ratios are lower, making restrictions there less impactful per mobility cost. Virginia's infection load and flow are moderate but do not warrant restriction given the trade-offs. By focusing restrictions on Mississippi, we target the greatest epidemic risk amplification while preserving essential mobility. This approach balances epidemic control goals with socioeconomic considerations by minimizing traffic disruption. Future policies should continue to evaluate dynamic infection metrics and mobility patterns to adaptively optimize travel restrictions."
