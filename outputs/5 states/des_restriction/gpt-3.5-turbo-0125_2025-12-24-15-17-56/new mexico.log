- Risk assessment: Texas has a relatively high number of active infections and deaths compared to the other destination states, indicating a higher risk of disease spread. Its SEIQRD indicators suggest a significant potential for transmission.
- Quantitative import logic: By reducing the inbound flow from New Mexico to Texas by 50%, we can potentially mitigate the import of infections into Texas and consequently reduce the overall spread of the disease.
- Justification of selection: Texas is prioritized over the other destination states due to its higher risk profile in terms of active infections and deaths. Restricting travel to Texas can have a significant impact on controlling the spread of the disease.
- Trade-offs: While the restriction may disrupt mobility between the two states, the primary objective is to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths for all states over the 2-week horizon. By implementing this restriction, we aim to strike a balance between epidemic control and mobility disruption."
