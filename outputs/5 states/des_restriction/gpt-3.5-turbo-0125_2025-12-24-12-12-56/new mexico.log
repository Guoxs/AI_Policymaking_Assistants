This temporary restriction is a trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption, with the goal of protecting public health."

      "notes": "Texas is selected for a temporary outbound travel restriction from New Mexico for the next two weeks. This decision is based on the high average daily inbound flow from New Mexico to Texas, which poses a significant risk of importing infections. By reducing the inbound flow by 50%, we aim to minimize the spread of the disease and protect both states' populations. The trade-off involves disrupting mobility between the two states temporarily for the sake of epidemic control."
      },
  "global_guidance": "The decision to restrict outbound travel to Texas for the next two weeks is crucial in mitigating the spread of the virus and reducing the burden on healthcare systems in both New Mexico and Texas. By cutting the inbound flow, we can potentially lower the number of imported infections and prevent further transmission within the states. This targeted approach allows for a balance between controlling the epidemic and minimizing disruptions to overall mobility."
