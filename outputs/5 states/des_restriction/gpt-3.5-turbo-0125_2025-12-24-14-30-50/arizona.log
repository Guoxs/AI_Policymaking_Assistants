{
  "weekly_policy": {
      "restricted_origin": "new mexico"
      },
  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the destination state 'new mexico' is selected for a temporary outbound travel restriction from arizona for the next 2 weeks. This decision is based on a risk assessment using SEIRD indicators, where 'new mexico' has a relatively higher average number of infectious (I) individuals compared to the other destination states. By reducing the inbound flow from arizona to 'new mexico' by 50%, we aim to minimize the potential import of infections and slow down the spread of the disease. The trade-off involves disrupting mobility to 'new mexico' but potentially reducing the overall cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in both states. No restriction is applied to the other destination states to maintain baseline mobility and control the epidemic effectively."
