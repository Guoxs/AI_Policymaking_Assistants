  "weekly_policy": {
      "restricted_origin": "texas"
      },
  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the state of Texas is prioritized for a temporary outbound travel restriction from Mississippi for the next two weeks. This decision is based on a risk assessment using SEIRD indicators, where Texas has a higher average number of infected and confirmed cases compared to the other destination states. By reducing the outbound flow to Texas by 50%, we aim to mitigate the potential importation of infections from Mississippi. The trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption is justified by the need to prioritize public health and minimize the spread of the disease. This targeted intervention aims to balance the control of the epidemic while minimizing disruptions to overall mobility."
