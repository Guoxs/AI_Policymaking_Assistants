{
  "weekly_policy": {
      "restricted_origin": "new mexico"
  },
  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the state of Texas should implement a temporary outbound travel restriction to New Mexico for the next 2 weeks. This decision is based on a risk assessment using SEIRD indicators, where New Mexico shows a relatively higher average number of infected and confirmed cases compared to other destination states. By reducing the inbound flow from Texas to New Mexico by 50%, we aim to minimize the potential importation of infections to New Mexico and prevent further spread of the disease. The trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption is justified by prioritizing public health and safety while considering the impact on inter-state travel and economic activities."
