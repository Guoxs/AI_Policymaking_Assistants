 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="In this scenario, the destination state 'new mexico' is selected for a temporary outbound travel restriction from arizona for the next 2 weeks. This decision is based on a risk assessment using SEIRD indicators, where 'new mexico' has a relatively higher average number of infectious (I) individuals compared to the other destination states. By reducing the inbound flow from arizona to 'new mexico' by 50percent, we aim to minimize the potential import of infections and slow down the spread of the disease. The trade-off involves disrupting mobility to 'new mexico' but potentially reducing the overall cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in both states. No restriction is applied to the other destination states to maintain baseline mobility and control the epidemic effectively."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='In this scenario, the state of Texas is prioritized for a temporary outbound travel restriction from Mississippi for the next two weeks. This decision is based on a risk assessment using SEIRD indicators, where Texas has a higher average number of infected and confirmed cases compared to the other destination states. By reducing the outbound flow to Texas by 50percent, we aim to mitigate the potential importation of infections from Mississippi. The trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption is justified by the need to prioritize public health and minimize the spread of the disease. This targeted intervention aims to balance the control of the epidemic while minimizing disruptions to overall mobility.'

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='In this scenario, the destination state of Texas is selected for a temporary outbound travel restriction from New Mexico for the next two weeks. The decision is based on a risk assessment considering the SEIRD indicators, where Texas has a relatively high number of infected individuals and deaths compared to the other destination states. By implementing a 50percent reduction in outbound flow to Texas, we aim to minimize the potential importation of infections into Texas from New Mexico, ultimately contributing to the overall control of the epidemic. The trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption is justified by prioritizing public health and the reduction of disease spread, which outweighs the temporary inconvenience of reduced mobility between the two states.'

This decision is based on a risk assessment using SEIRD indicators, where New Mexico shows a relatively higher average number of infected and confirmed cases compared to other destination states. By reducing the inbound flow from Texas to New Mexico by 50percent, we aim to minimize the potential importation of infections to New Mexico and prevent further spread of the disease. The trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption is justified by prioritizing public health and safety while considering the impact on inter-state travel and economic activities.'

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='In this scenario, the destination state of Texas is selected for a temporary outbound travel restriction from Virginia for the next two weeks. Texas has a relatively high average daily inbound flow from Virginia and a significant population size, indicating a higher risk of importing infections. By reducing the inbound flow from Virginia to Texas by 50percent, we aim to minimize the spread of the disease and potential impact on both states. This decision is made considering the trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption, prioritizing public health outcomes. The other destination states are not selected for restriction as they have either lower inbound flows or smaller populations, making the impact of the restriction less significant.'
