      "restricted_origin": "texas"
      },
  "global_guidance": "In this scenario, the destination state of Texas is selected for a temporary outbound travel restriction from Virginia for the next two weeks. Texas has a relatively high average daily inbound flow from Virginia and a significant population size, indicating a higher risk of importing infections. By reducing the inbound flow from Virginia to Texas by 50%, we aim to minimize the spread of the disease and potential impact on both states. This decision is made considering the trade-off between epidemic control and mobility disruption, prioritizing public health outcomes. The other destination states are not selected for restriction as they have either lower inbound flows or smaller populations, making the impact of the restriction less significant."
