The distribution of inbound traffic over the week aims to balance epidemic control and mobility, reducing the risk of spreading the infection. Collaboration among states in controlling traffic can help in collectively reducing the imported infections and deaths. Sensitivity analysis should be conducted to assess the impact of varying prevalence or transmission rates on the effectiveness of these traffic control measures.'
