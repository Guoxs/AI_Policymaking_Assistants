      "notes": "Considering the high average past 21-day inflow from Arizona to Virginia and the relatively lower susceptible population in Arizona, a strict-first pattern is recommended. By allocating a higher proportion of traffic control in the initial days, we aim to reduce the immediate risk of imported infections.

By distributing traffic control measures evenly over the 7 days, we aim to manage the risk of imported infections while allowing for some mobility.

By strategically balancing the traffic allocations over the 7 days, we aim to minimize the impact on Virginia's epidemic situation while considering the varying risk levels and mobility needs of each state. The cooperation logic involves adjusting traffic control measures to achieve a balance between epidemic control and essential mobility. Sensitivity analysis should be conducted to assess how changes in prevalence or beta values may affect the recommended traffic control policies."
