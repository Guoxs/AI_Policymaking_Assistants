By strategically adjusting the traffic allocations based on the risk levels in each state, we aim to minimize the cumulative impact on New Mexico's epidemic situation. The balance between strict and relaxed controls across the states over the 7 days is crucial in maintaining control over the spread of the disease while allowing for necessary mobility. It is important to continuously monitor and adjust these traffic control measures based on the evolving epidemic situation and mobility needs."
