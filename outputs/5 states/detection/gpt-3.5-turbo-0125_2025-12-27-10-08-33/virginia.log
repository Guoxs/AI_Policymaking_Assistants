  "global_guidance": "For the upcoming 2-week horizon, the targeted inbound screening policy should be implemented for travelers arriving from Texas to Virginia. Texas has a relatively high infectious density (E+I)/Population compared to other origin states, indicating a higher risk of disease importation. By enforcing a rigorous screening mandate with a ninety percent conversion rate of E and I individuals to Q status, we can effectively detect and isolate hidden infections at the border, minimizing the spread within Virginia. This targeted approach allows for better resource allocation and reduces the systemic risk of importing cases. By selecting Texas, we are not only addressing a significant source of potential infections but also focusing our efforts on a state that has a substantial inbound flow into Virginia, maximizing the impact of the screening policy."
