  "global_guidance": "In implementing the targeted inbound screening policy for the next 2 weeks, the state of Texas should focus on Arizona due to its higher infectious density (E+I)/Population compared to other origin states. By enforcing a rigorous screening mandate capturing individuals from the E and I compartments, Texas can significantly reduce the hidden infectious population entering the community. Targeting Arizona not only allows for the detection of hidden infections but also minimizes the risk of disease importation. By selecting Arizona, Texas can efficiently coordinate efforts with other states to collectively combat the spread of the disease while filling a crucial gap in regional defense."
