Texas has a relatively high infectious density, making it a significant source of potential disease importation. By enforcing a rigorous ninety percent screening mandate, we can capture a considerable number of hidden infections at the border, reducing the risk of introducing more cases into Arizona. This targeted approach allows us to focus on a high-risk state while also considering the coordination aspect, as Texas is a primary source of inbound traffic to Arizona. By implementing this policy, we aim to minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona while mitigating the risks of disease spread."

Evaluating the Source Risk Profile, Mississippi has a relatively high Infectious Density compared to other origin states, indicating a higher risk of disease importation.
