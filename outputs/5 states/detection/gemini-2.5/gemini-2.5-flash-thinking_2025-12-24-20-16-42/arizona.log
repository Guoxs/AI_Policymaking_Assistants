New Mexico, despite having a lower infectious density (0.000350) compared to Mississippi (0.001740) and Virginia (0.000590), presents the highest 'hidden infection' risk due to its significantly larger average daily inbound flow of 18,891 into Arizona. The estimated number of hidden infections (E+I) entering from New Mexico is approximately 6.6 per day (18891 * 0.000350), which, when 90% are converted to Q, means about 6 individuals per day are detected and isolated. While Mississippi has a higher infectious density, its inbound flow is much lower (1,524), resulting in fewer daily hidden infections (2.6).

While Mississippi has the highest infectious density, New Mexico presents the greatest risk due to its high inbound flow to Arizona (31,247 people daily) coupled with a non-negligible infectious density. The estimated 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) from New Mexico entering arizona daily is approximately 7.2. By implementing a 90% screening mandate, we anticipate converting around 6-7 'Hidden Infections' from New Mexico to 'Confirmed' (Q) status daily. This targeted approach aims to significantly reduce the hidden infectious population entering our community, preventing further spread. Although Texas has a higher total E+I, its infectious density is lower, and its raw inbound E+I contribution is similar to New Mexico's despite higher overall flow. This choice balances the infectious density with the absolute volume of potential hidden carriers entering arizona, providing a focused intervention to maximize detection utility and minimize disease importation risk."

Mississippi presents the highest infectious density with an (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.062 (52740 / 840863), significantly higher than other states. While its average daily inbound flow of 1831 is not the largest, the high infectious density means a substantial number of hidden infections would be imported without intervention. Implementing a 90% screening on mississippi travelers is projected to capture approximately 47.9 hidden infections (90% of (E+I) * inbound_flow / total_population = 0.9 * (35395+17345) * 1831 / 840863) per day, directly converting them to Q-status. This proactive detection strategy reduces the uncontrolled spread within arizona. Although texas has a higher inbound flow (45155), its infectious density is much lower (0.00028), resulting in fewer hidden infections per traveler. Screening texas would yield fewer captured hidden infections relative to the effort. Therefore, targeting mississippi is the most effective strategy to mitigate the risk of disease importation given its exceptionally high infectious density, preventing a potentially significant localized outbreak from highly infectious individuals, and focusing resources on the most impactful intervention."

While new mexico and texas have higher baseline inbound flows to arizona, their extremely low infectious densities mean that the absolute number of hidden infections (E and I) they contribute is comparatively small. Virginia, despite having a higher infectious density than new mexico and texas, has a much lower inbound flow than mississippi. Mississippi, with its high infectious density, despite having a moderate inbound flow, poses the most concentrated risk of importing hidden infections. Implementing a 90% screening mandate on travelers from mississippi allows us to capture a substantial proportion of these hidden E and I cases, converting them to Q-status upon arrival. This strategy prioritizes the state with the highest per-capita infection risk, maximizing the utility of our screening efforts by targeting the most efficient source of hidden infections for conversion. This allows us to make a significant impact on slowing disease spread by reducing the 'silent' introduction of the virus into arizona."

  "global_guidance": "The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for Mississippi is driven by a comprehensive evaluation of source risk and detection utility. Mississippi presents the highest infectious density among the potential origin states, with a significant proportion of its population currently in the Exposed (E) and Infected (I) compartments relative to its total population. Specifically, its (E+I)/Population ratio is substantially higher than other states like New Mexico, Texas, or Virginia. This elevated infectious density suggests a higher probability of importing hidden infections into Arizona. By targeting Mississippi, we estimate capturing approximately 10,867 hidden infections (E and I) over the next 14 days, converting them to the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival. This Q-conversion is crucial as it removes these individuals from the actively circulating infectious pool, thereby mitigating their potential to spread the disease within Arizona. While other states like Texas and New Mexico have higher absolute inbound flows, their infectious densities are comparatively lower, meaning a screening on Mississippi, despite its lower inflow, offers a more impactful intervention per traveler due to the higher prevalence of disease. This strategy prioritizes targeting the most concentrated source of potential hidden infections, aiming to significantly reduce the risk of disease importation and subsequent spread within Arizona, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths."

This is by far the highest among all potential origin states. Despite mississippi having the lowest average daily inbound flow to arizona (2,184 travelers), its disproportionately high infectious density means that a significant number of hidden infections are still entering arizona daily. Specifically, a 90% screening mandate for mississippi is projected to capture approximately 303 hidden infections (E and I) per day, directly converting them to Confirmed (Q) status upon arrival. This number is substantially higher than the estimated captures from any other state: virginia (94), texas (52), and new mexico (46). By targeting mississippi, arizona prioritizes the most effective intervention to prevent the silent spread of the virus within its borders, directly minimizing potential cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. While mississippi's high-risk status might make it an obvious target for other states, arizona's policy is focused on maximizing the reduction of imported hidden infections, leveraging the screening's ability to identify and isolate these cases before they can contribute to local transmission."
