Texas presents the highest 'Infectious Density' among all potential origin states, with a combined (E+I)/Population of approximately 0.00027, which is significantly higher than other states like arizona (0.00003), new mexico (0.000007), and virginia (0.00004). More critically, Texas has by far the largest average daily inbound flow into mississippi, at 47,740 individuals. This high volume, coupled with a substantial infectious density, means a greater number of 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) are consistently entering mississippi from Texas.

Texas presents the highest infectious density among all potential origin states, with a combined (E+I)/Population of approximately 0.00065, significantly higher than Arizona (0.00012) and New Mexico (0.000007). Crucially, Texas also contributes the largest daily inbound flow to Mississippi (35,978 individuals). This high volume, coupled with a notable infectious density, means that Texas is projected to import the most 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) into Mississippi.

While Arizona also has a relatively high infectious density, its inbound flow is significantly lower (2,086), resulting in fewer imported hidden infections. This strategy prioritizes targeting the largest source of potential hidden infections, thereby maximizing the utility of the 90% Q-conversion policy to mitigate disease spread and minimize future cases and deaths in Mississippi.

Crucially, Texas also contributes the largest daily inbound flow to Mississippi (35,978 individuals). This high volume, coupled with a notable infectious density, means that Texas is projected to import the most 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) into Mississippi. By screening travelers from Texas, an estimated 20.3 E and I individuals per day will be immediately identified and moved to the Q compartment, preventing their potential spread within Mississippi. While Arizona also has a relatively high infectious density, its inbound flow is significantly lower (2,086), resulting in fewer imported hidden infections. This strategy prioritizes targeting the largest source of potential hidden infections, thereby maximizing the utility of the 90percent Q-conversion policy to mitigate disease spread and minimize future cases and deaths in Mississippi. This approach focuses on the most impactful intervention given the policy's constraints, rather than dissipating resources on states with lower overall importation risk, and aims to complement efforts by other states who may be targeting their own highest-risk neighbors."

  "global_guidance": "The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for travelers originating from Virginia is based on a comprehensive risk assessment. First, regarding the Source Risk Profile, Virginia presents the highest estimated daily inflow of 'Hidden Infections' (Exposed and Infected individuals) into Mississippi, calculated at approximately 51.70 individuals per day. While Arizona has a slightly higher overall infectious density, Virginia's larger inbound mobility volume makes it the primary vector for disease importation in terms of absolute E+I numbers. Second, the Detection Utility of this policy is significant: with a 90% screening mandate, an estimated 46.53 E/I individuals from Virginia would be immediately identified and moved into the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival. This directly prevents these individuals from silently contributing to community spread within Mississippi, thereby reducing the burden on local healthcare and minimizing future confirmed cases and deaths. Lastly, in terms of Coordination vs. Competition, this intervention targets the most impactful single source of hidden infections entering Mississippi, allowing for a focused and efficient use of screening resources. Given Mississippi's own substantial internal infection levels, mitigating the most significant external import risk is a critical step in overall epidemic control without necessarily competing for resources with other states that might be targeting different high-risk origins."

Firstly, arizona presents the highest 'Infectious Density' among all potential origin states, with a combined (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.0187.

Secondly, the 'Detection Utility' of screening arizona is estimated to be the highest. Given arizona's high E and I numbers and its notable inbound flow into mississippi (1891 daily average), a 90% screening effectiveness would convert approximately 31 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) into Q-status daily. This is a substantial number compared to other states, directly mitigating the influx of infectious individuals who would otherwise spread the disease unnoticed. While texas has a higher inbound flow, its infectious density is significantly lower, making arizona a more impactful target for reducing hidden infections.
