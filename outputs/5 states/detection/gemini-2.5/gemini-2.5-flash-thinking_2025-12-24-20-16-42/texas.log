We first calculated the 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population) for each potential origin state. New Mexico presents the highest infectious density at 0.000999, followed by Mississippi (0.000895), Virginia (0.000588), and Arizona (0.000401). While Mississippi has a higher 'I' count, New Mexico's smaller population pushes its overall infectious density higher. We then estimated the number of hidden infections that would enter Texas from each state over 14 days based on their baseline inbound flow and infectious density. New Mexico, despite not having the highest absolute E+I count, has a significant daily inbound flow (84,217) into Texas, resulting in an estimated 1,179 hidden infections over two weeks (84217 * 0.000999 * 14). This is substantially higher than Arizona (157), Mississippi (232), or Virginia (114). By targeting New Mexico, we anticipate converting approximately 90% of these 1,179 hidden infections, or about 1,061 individuals, into the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival. This proactive detection strategy prevents these individuals from silently spreading the disease within Texas, thereby reducing the overall cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. This choice represents a targeted intervention against the most significant source of hidden infectious importation, aiming to effectively reduce the overall disease burden in Texas."

This action directly addresses the most concentrated source of hidden infection, effectively minimizing potential community transmission within Texas. While other states also contribute to imported cases, prioritizing Mississippi targets the most impactful source based on a combination of high infectious density and substantial inbound hidden infections, aligning with the objective to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas, regardless of potential overlaps with other agents' strategies."

2025-12-24 20:27:08,823 - texas - INFO - Parsed PolicyResponse: policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for Mississippi is based on a comprehensive analysis of source risk profiles and detection utility. Mississippi presents the highest infectious density with an (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.05329, significantly greater than other potential origin states like Arizona (0.003822), Virginia (0.004795), and New Mexico (0.000396). This high infectious density, combined with its substantial daily inbound flow to Texas, translates into an estimated 1592.94 hidden infections (E+I) entering Texas daily from Mississippi. By enforcing a ninety percent screening mandate, we project to capture and convert approximately 1433.65 individuals from the Exposed (E) and Infected (I) compartments directly into the Confirmed (Q) compartment each day. This is a far greater number of prevented hidden infections than from any other state, making it the most impactful intervention. This strategy prioritizes the most potent source of disease importation, effectively reducing the hidden infectious population entering Texas and thereby minimizing the potential for new community transmissions, cumulative confirmed cases, and deaths. This choice is a proactive measure to address the most significant identified risk, rather than simply targeting the highest volume of traffic, ensuring efficient resource allocation for public health protection.'

  "global_guidance": "Our analysis focuses on identifying the origin state posing the highest risk of undetected infections entering Texas. We calculate the 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population) for each potential source. Mississippi presents the most critical threat with a significantly higher infectious density of 0.283 compared to Arizona (0.014), New Mexico (0.0009), and Virginia (0.015). Although New Mexico has the highest inbound flow to Texas, its infectious density is remarkably low, suggesting a minimal risk of hidden infections. Mississippi, despite having a moderate inbound flow of 28,405 travelers, offers the greatest detection utility. Implementing a 90% screening mandate for travelers from Mississippi is estimated to capture approximately 10,757 hidden infections (E and I) over the two-week period. This intervention directly addresses a high-risk, high-density source, effectively converting a substantial number of potentially spreading individuals into monitored Q-status. This strategy prioritizes mitigating the most concentrated source of hidden infections, preventing widespread community transmission within Texas, and complements potential actions by other states targeting their primary inbound risks."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas, we recommend implementing a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for travelers arriving from Virginia for the next two weeks. Our analysis of 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population) reveals that Virginia, with a density of approximately 1.73%, presents a significant risk, surpassing Arizona (1.89% but lower inflow), New Mexico (0.11%), and Mississippi (11.7% but significantly lower inflow). While Mississippi has a higher infectious density, Virginia's substantial average daily inbound flow of 29,515 travelers makes it a more impactful target for intervention. This screening is estimated to capture approximately 1,200 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) from Virginia, converting them to Q-status upon arrival. This action directly reduces the hidden infectious population entering Texas, preventing further undetected community spread. By targeting Virginia, we are addressing a high-risk source with a considerable inbound volume, optimizing the utility of our screening resources to mitigate disease importation effectively. This proactive measure aims to significantly reduce the potential for new outbreaks originating from incoming travelers, thereby protecting Texas's population."
