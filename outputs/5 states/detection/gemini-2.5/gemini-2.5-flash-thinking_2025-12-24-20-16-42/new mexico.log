However, infectious density alone does not dictate the total risk of imported cases. When considering the average daily inbound flow into New Mexico, Texas has the highest flow (47,170), followed by Arizona (19,529), Virginia (1,385), and Mississippi (942). To identify the most impactful target for intervention, we calculated the expected number of hidden infections (E+I) entering New Mexico daily from each state. Arizona stands out with an estimated 7.82 hidden infections per day, significantly higher than Texas (2.04), Mississippi (0.84), and Virginia (0.81). Implementing a 90% targeted screening policy on travelers from Arizona would effectively convert approximately 7.04 hidden infections daily into the confirmed (Q) compartment, preventing their undetected spread within New Mexico. This strategy directly addresses the most substantial source of imported, undetected disease, providing the greatest utility in reducing overall case counts and deaths for New Mexico. This choice prioritizes the most immediate and quantifiable risk, ensuring a robust defense against external disease vectors."

Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density at approximately 0.01245, indicating a high proportion of Exposed (E) and Infected (I) individuals within its population. Virginia and Arizona follow with moderate densities of about 0.00149 and 0.00125, respectively, while Texas has a significantly lower density of 0.00016. However, to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico, the strategy prioritizes intercepting the highest absolute number of hidden infections. Arizona, despite its moderate infectious density, contributes the largest daily inbound flow of potentially infectious individuals into New Mexico, estimated at 48.54 E+I travelers. Implementing a 90% screening mandate for Arizona would effectively convert approximately 43.69 E+I individuals to the Confirmed (Q) compartment daily, preventing their unmonitored spread within New Mexico. In contrast, screening Texas would capture about 17.05 E+I individuals, and Mississippi, despite its high density, would yield only around 15.98 captured E+I due to lower inbound traffic. Therefore, targeting Arizona represents the most impactful intervention, directly addressing the largest source of imported infections and maximizing the reduction of disease transmission within New Mexico. This approach focuses on the most significant immediate threat to New Mexico's public health, aiming for optimal local protection."

Evaluating the source risk profiles, mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density at approximately 0.0187, indicating a significant proportion of its population is in the Exposed or Infected states. Arizona and Virginia follow with moderate densities around 0.0016 to 0.0019, while Texas has a considerably lower density of 0.000185. However, infectious density alone does not dictate the importation risk. When considering the average daily inbound flow into new mexico, arizona emerges as the primary vector for hidden infections. Despite its moderate infectious density, arizona's substantial daily inbound flow of 41,259 travelers translates to an estimated 64.76 hidden infections (E+I) entering new mexico daily without intervention. This figure significantly surpasses those from mississippi (30.05), texas (24.59), and virginia (4.02). Implementing a rigorous ninety percent screening mandate for arizona travelers is projected to convert approximately 58 hidden infections into the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival each day. This substantial detection utility will effectively reduce the seeding of new infections within new mexico's susceptible population, thereby mitigating the rise in cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. This policy prioritizes direct impact on new mexico's epidemic trajectory by targeting the state contributing the largest absolute number of hidden infections, rather than simply the state with the highest prevalence, ensuring optimal resource allocation and maximizing the protective effect of the intervention."

  "global_guidance": "The policy recommends implementing targeted inbound screening for travelers arriving from Arizona for the next two weeks. This decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of each origin state's infectious density and its contribution to New Mexico's inbound hidden infections. Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density at approximately 0.027, significantly higher than Arizona's 0.0019, Virginia's 0.0023, and Texas's 0.0002. However, when considering detection utility, Arizona presents the most impactful target. Despite its lower infectious density compared to Mississippi, Arizona has a substantially higher average daily inbound flow into New Mexico (41,834 travelers vs. Mississippi's 1,565). This higher volume means that, on average, 81.24 individuals in the daily flow from Arizona are estimated to be in the Exposed (E) or Infected (I) compartments. Implementing a 90% screening mandate would effectively capture and move approximately 73.12 of these hidden infections directly into the Confirmed (Q) compartment daily. This significantly surpasses the 38.12 hidden infections that would be captured from Mississippi, the 24.49 from Texas, or the 5.19 from Virginia. Therefore, while Mississippi has a higher risk profile in terms of prevalence, targeting Arizona is a strategic decision to maximize the prevention of imported hidden infections, thereby directly contributing to minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico. This approach prioritizes the absolute number of infections prevented from entering the community over merely identifying the state with the highest internal prevalence, representing a pragmatic and effective regional defense."

  "global_guidance": "The decision to target Mississippi for inbound screening is based on a comprehensive risk assessment. Mississippi presents the highest infectious density among all potential origin states, with a combined (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 6.2%, significantly higher than Arizona (0.4%), Texas (0.02%), and Virginia (0.49%). This indicates a higher per-capita risk of disease importation from Mississippi. Furthermore, while Mississippi's average daily inbound flow to New Mexico is not the largest, the screening of this state offers the highest detection utility for hidden infections. Given its high infectious density, a 90% screening mandate would effectively identify and move a substantial proportion of currently Exposed (E) and Infected (I) individuals into the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival. This strategy aims to significantly reduce the 'hidden' infectious population entering New Mexico, thereby mitigating the risk of community transmission and minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. This choice also represents a strategic balance; while Texas has a larger inbound flow, its infectious density is remarkably low, making screening less impactful. Targeting Mississippi allows New Mexico to address a potent, albeit smaller, source of potential hidden infections, complementing any broader regional strategies that might focus on larger, but less acutely infectious, flows."

We evaluated the 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population) for all neighboring states.

The estimated 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) arriving from Texas are substantial, approximately 18.2 E and 29.6 I individuals daily (totaling ~47.8 hidden infections).

This strategy targets the highest volume source of potential importation, aiming to capture a significant number of 'hidden' infections that would otherwise contribute to community transmission. While other states like Mississippi have a higher (E+I)/Population, their inbound flow to New Mexico is comparatively negligible. Therefore, targeting Texas allows us to maximize the 'Detection Utility' by converting the largest absolute number of E and I cases to Q, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico.

We evaluate the 'Infectious Density' (E+I)/Population for each potential origin state. Mississippi has the highest infectious density at 9.6% ((69599+26839)/469859), far exceeding Texas (0.07%), Arizona (1.1%), and Virginia (1.3%). While Texas has the largest absolute inbound flow to New Mexico, its very low infectious density means a screening policy would capture a minimal number of E and I cases relative to the effort. Conversely, Mississippi's high infectious density, despite a lower absolute inflow (1137 avg daily), translates to a higher concentration of hidden infections per traveler. Implementing a 90% screening on Mississippi travelers would convert approximately 90% of (E+I) cases from this high-risk population directly to Q upon arrival, effectively preventing their uncontrolled spread within New Mexico. This strategy prioritizes capturing a significant proportion of the most infectious inbound population, providing a high 'Detection Utility' by converting a substantial number of 'Hidden Infections' to 'Confirmed' status. This approach balances 'Coordination vs. Competition' by addressing a potent, albeit smaller, source of infection that might be overlooked by other states focusing solely on the largest flow volumes, ensuring a targeted and efficient use of screening resources to mitigate disease importation risks for New Mexico."

  "global_guidance": "The decision to implement targeted inbound screening for Arizona is driven by a comprehensive evaluation of source risk profiles and potential detection utility. While Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density at approximately 15.9% ((E+I)/Pop), its average daily inflow into New Mexico is comparatively low. Conversely, Arizona, despite having a moderate infectious density of about 1.4%, presents an exceptionally high average daily inbound flow of over 13 million individuals according to the provided data. This staggering volume translates into an estimated 184,000 hidden infections (E and I) potentially entering New Mexico daily from Arizona. Implementing a 90% screening mandate for Arizona would lead to the immediate identification and quarantine (conversion to Q status) of approximately 165,600 individuals who would otherwise circulate undetected within our communities. This significantly dwarfs the potential conversions from other states; for instance, screening Mississippi would convert only about 294 individuals. Therefore, from a detection utility perspective, targeting Arizona yields the most substantial reduction in the 'hidden' infectious population entering our state. This strategic choice prioritizes addressing the largest numerical source of potential disease importation, ensuring New Mexico's defenses are focused on mitigating the most impactful threat to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths, rather than solely focusing on states with higher per-capita infection rates but lower overall traffic volume."

  "global_guidance": "Analysis of origin states' infectious densities and inbound travel volumes reveals varying risk profiles. Mississippi presents the highest infectious density at approximately 0.154, indicating a high proportion of exposed and infected individuals within its population. Arizona follows with a moderate infectious density of 0.017, while Virginia and Texas exhibit lower densities of 0.014 and 0.00096, respectively. When considering detection utility, the absolute number of hidden infections (E+I) that would be captured by a 90% screening policy is crucial. Despite Mississippi's high infectious density, its average daily inbound flow to New Mexico is relatively low at 1008 travelers, leading to an estimated 140 E+I individuals captured daily. In contrast, Arizona, with its moderate infectious density but significantly higher daily inbound flow of 27828 travelers, would result in the detection and conversion of approximately 432 E+I individuals to confirmed (Q) status daily. Texas, despite having the largest inbound flow, has a very low infectious density, yielding only about 69 captured E+I cases daily. To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico, the most effective strategy is to target the origin state that contributes the highest absolute number of hidden infections. Therefore, Arizona is selected for targeted inbound screening. This decision prioritizes the direct reduction of imported infections by focusing on the source with the greatest numerical impact on New Mexico, rather than solely on the highest infectious density, thereby maximizing the utility of the screening intervention for New Mexico's specific epidemiological context."
