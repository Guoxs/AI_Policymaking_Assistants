Mississippi presents the highest (E+I)/Population ratio at 0.062, indicating a widespread presence of hidden infections within its population. While other states like arizona and virginia also have notable E+I populations, their overall population sizes dilute their infectious density compared to Mississippi. New Mexico, conversely, has a very low infectious density. By targeting Mississippi, we estimate capturing approximately 5253 hidden infections (E+I) that would otherwise enter texas and contribute to community spread. This strategy aims to proactively convert these E and I individuals into Q status upon arrival, thereby preventing them from spreading the disease within texas. This is a strategic choice to target the most concentrated source of potential infection, rather than competing with other states for the most populous or highest absolute E+I states, ensuring a focused and impactful intervention to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in texas.'

Mississippi presents the highest source risk profile, with an infectious density (E+I)/Population of approximately 0.0518, which is significantly elevated compared to other origin states and texas's own internal density. This indicates a substantial proportion of its population is currently exposed or actively infected, posing a considerable threat for disease importation.

Over the 14-day policy duration, this translates to over 20,500 individuals being moved from the Exposed or Infected compartments directly into the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival, effectively preventing these hidden carriers from circulating within texas and initiating new transmission chains. This intervention directly addresses the most potent source of potential disease importation. The choice to target mississippi, rather than other states, reflects a strategy of focusing resources on the most critical and 'obvious' high-risk origin.

Furthermore, arizona contributes a substantial average daily inbound flow of 45426 travelers to texas. The screening mandate, converting 90percent of exposed and infected individuals to confirmed (Q) status upon arrival, is estimated to capture a significant number of hidden infections. Specifically, from arizona's daily inbound flow, approximately 45426 * (104535 / 9363060) = 507.7 (E+I) individuals are expected to enter texas daily. With a 90percent screening effectiveness, this policy could prevent around 457 'hidden' infected or exposed individuals from circulating within texas daily, thereby reducing community transmission risks. While other states like mississippi also show a high infectious density, their inbound flow to texas is considerably lower, making the impact of screening less pronounced. Targeting arizona addresses the largest flow of high-risk individuals, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in texas by proactively identifying and isolating potential vectors."

  "global_guidance": "The decision to implement Targeted Inbound Screening on travelers from arizona is driven by a comprehensive assessment of source risk, detection utility, and strategic coordination. Arizona presents the highest Infectious Density among the candidate states, with an (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 1.51%, significantly higher than mississippi's 1.48%, virginia's 1.41%, and new mexico's 0.10%. This indicates a greater likelihood of infectious individuals traveling from arizona into texas. Furthermore, arizona has the highest average daily inbound flow into texas at 42,590 travelers. By applying a 90% screening mandate to arizona, we estimate capturing approximately 5,745 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) per day over the 14-day period (0.9 * (120863 E + 7770 I) / 8490723 Pop * 42590 Inflow). This substantial conversion of E and I to Q upon arrival will significantly reduce the hidden infectious load entering texas, thereby mitigating potential community spread and minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. While mississippi also has a high infectious density, its inbound flow to texas is considerably lower (28,405), making the impact of screening less pronounced. Targeting arizona addresses the most significant source of potential importation risk, aligning with a strategy to tackle the largest and most infectious inbound pathway first, even if it might be an 'obvious' high-risk choice, as its impact on texas's epidemiological trajectory is projected to be the most beneficial."

  "global_guidance": "The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for mississippi is driven by a comprehensive risk assessment. mississippi presents the highest 'Infectious Density' with an (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.1502, significantly exceeding that of other potential origin states like arizona (0.0177), virginia (0.0138), and new mexico (0.0013). This high density indicates a substantially elevated probability that any given traveler from mississippi is currently exposed or infected. Furthermore, considering the average daily inbound flow from mississippi into texas (38,606 individuals), this high infectious density translates to an estimated 5,798 hidden infections (E+I) entering texas daily from this single source. The proposed policy's 'Detection Utility' is estimated to capture and convert approximately 5,218 of these hidden infections into confirmed cases (Q-status) each day (90% of 5,798). This substantial daily conversion will significantly reduce the number of undetected infectious individuals circulating within texas, thereby minimizing potential onward transmission and ultimately mitigating cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. While other states may have higher overall inbound flow (e.g., new mexico), their lower infectious densities result in fewer estimated hidden infections, making mississippi the most impactful target for this intervention. This strategy prioritizes addressing the most concentrated and potent source of disease importation to maximize public health benefit for texas."
