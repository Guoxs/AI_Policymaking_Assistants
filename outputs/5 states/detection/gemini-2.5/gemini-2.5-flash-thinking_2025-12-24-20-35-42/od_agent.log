 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for new mexico is based on a comprehensive risk assessment. new mexico exhibits the highest infectious density among all potential origin states, with an (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.000998. This indicates a relatively high prevalence of hidden infections within its population. More critically, new mexico contributes the largest daily inbound flow of travelers into arizona, with an average of 14,511 individuals. The combination of high infectious density and substantial inbound mobility results in new mexico posing the greatest risk of importing hidden infections into arizona, with an estimated 14.48 potentially exposed or infected individuals entering daily. By implementing a 90percent screening mandate, we anticipate converting approximately 13.03 hidden E/I cases into confirmed (Q) cases daily, thereby significantly reducing the introduction of new infectious vectors into our community and mitigating future disease spread. This strategic intervention focuses on the most impactful source, ensuring efficient resource allocation to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in arizona.'

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to target Virginia for inbound screening stems from a multi-faceted risk assessment. Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density among all potential origin states, with a combined (E+I) population of 5014 out of approximately 8.5 million, leading to a density of 0.000589. This indicates a higher per-capita risk of individuals carrying hidden infections. While Texas has the highest absolute inbound flow, its infectious density is significantly lower (0.000043), suggesting that a higher proportion of infections would be imported from Virginia per traveler. Implementing the 90percent screening policy on Virginia's inbound flow (2260 individuals daily) is estimated to convert approximately 120 hidden infections (E+I) to Q status daily, significantly reducing the introduction of actively infectious or incubating individuals into Mississippi. This strategy prioritizes targeting the most concentrated source of potential hidden infections, rather than simply the largest flow, thereby maximizing the detection utility per screened individual. This approach aims to preemptively mitigate disease spread by intercepting high-risk individuals, even if it means not targeting the state with the largest overall inbound traffic, thus complementing broader regional defense efforts by focusing on a critical, high-density vector."

 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to target Arizona for inbound screening is driven by a comprehensive risk assessment. Arizona presents the highest infectious density among all candidate states, with a significant (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.00040. This indicates a higher probability of infected or exposed individuals entering New Mexico from Arizona compared to other states. Furthermore, Arizona contributes the largest number of hidden infections (E+I) into New Mexico daily, with an estimated 19.1 individuals, which is substantially higher than Texas (0.9), Mississippi (0.9), and Virginia (0.5). Implementing a 90percent screening mandate for Arizona arrivals will effectively convert an estimated 17 hidden infections (E and I) into the Confirmed (Q) compartment daily, preventing them from silently spreading the disease within New Mexico's susceptible population. While Texas has a higher overall inbound flow, its infectious density and absolute number of hidden infections are considerably lower. This targeted approach prioritizes intercepting the most significant source of undiagnosed disease importation, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico. This strategy is a proactive measure to reduce systemic risk by focusing on the most potent external threat, rather than diffusing resources on states with lower immediate impact."

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The policy decision for the next two-week horizon is to implement Targeted Inbound Screening for travelers originating from New Mexico. This choice is based on a comprehensive evaluation of source risk profiles and detection utility across all potential origin states. New Mexico exhibits the highest 'Infectious Density' with an (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.00099770, indicating a higher prevalence of hidden infections within its population compared to other states. Crucially, New Mexico also has the largest average daily inbound flow into Texas, at 84,217 travelers. By combining this high infectious density with the substantial daily inflow, our 90percent screening mandate is estimated to capture approximately 75.62 Exposed (E) or Infected (I) individuals daily, converting them directly to the Confirmed (Q) compartment. This significantly surpasses the potential capture from any other origin state, offering the most substantial reduction in the introduction of hidden infectious individuals into Texas. This targeted approach prioritizes addressing the most impactful source of potential disease importation, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths within Texas, while acknowledging that other agents might also identify New Mexico as a high-risk origin due to its epidemiological profile."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis focuses on minimizing the importation of 'hidden' infections (E and I) into Virginia, thereby reducing future confirmed cases and deaths. We first assessed the infectious density ((E+I)/Population) for all potential origin states. Texas presents the highest population size and, critically, the highest average daily inbound flow into Virginia (11,782 travelers), making it the largest potential vector for disease importation despite a lower individual infectious density compared to Mississippi or New Mexico. The sheer volume of travelers from Texas means that even with a moderate infectious density, the absolute number of 'hidden' infections entering Virginia is substantial. By implementing a Targeted Inbound Screening policy on Texas, we estimate that approximately 90percent of the 1.5 'hidden' infections (E+I) per day (0.000125 * 11782) from this origin would be immediately moved to the Confirmed (Q) compartment. This intervention captures the largest absolute number of potential E and I cases at the point of entry, significantly reducing the 'hidden' infectious load entering our community. While Mississippi and New Mexico have higher per capita infectious densities, their much lower inbound flows mean that screening them would yield a proportionally smaller impact on overall disease spread within Virginia. This strategy prioritizes targeting the largest source of potential disease importation to achieve maximum utility in reducing our state's cumulative case burden, anticipating that other states may target other high-risk origins."

While Mississippi has the highest infectious density, New Mexico presents a unique risk profile due to its significantly higher average daily inbound flow into Arizona (18,891 travelers) compared to other states. Despite a lower individual infectious density than Mississippi, the sheer volume of travelers from New Mexico means that a substantial number of hidden infections (E+I) are likely to enter Arizona daily. Specifically, New Mexico's (E+I) population is 841, and with an average flow of 18,891, approximately 6.6 hidden infectious individuals (841 / 2,396,032 * 18,891) could enter daily. Implementing a 90percent screening on these individuals would convert an estimated 6 individuals per day to Q status, preventing them from spreading the disease undetected within Arizona. This strategy prioritizes the capture of a larger absolute number of hidden infections from a high-volume source, even if its individual infectious density is not the highest, thereby offering a more impactful reduction in potential disease spread for Arizona. This move also considers that other agents might target the highest density states, allowing Arizona to address a significant, yet potentially overlooked, vector of disease importation."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for Texas is based on a comprehensive evaluation of inbound infection risk. While Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density at approximately 0.00059 (E+I)/Population, its average daily inbound flow to Mississippi is relatively low at 3005 travelers. In contrast, Texas, despite having a lower infectious density of approximately 0.000068, contributes an overwhelmingly larger volume of daily inbound travelers, averaging 31103. This high volume translates to the largest number of 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) entering Mississippi daily from any single origin state, estimated at 2.127 individuals. Implementing a 90percent screening mandate for Texas is projected to effectively detect and convert approximately 1.914 Exposed (E) and Infected (I) individuals to Confirmed (Q) status each day, significantly reducing the 'hidden' infectious population that would otherwise integrate into the community and contribute to local transmission. This strategy prioritizes the absolute number of imported hidden infections over per-capita density, ensuring the maximum immediate impact on disease control within Mississippi. This approach is a strategic choice, aiming to mitigate the most significant source of imported cases, thereby complementing broader regional efforts that might focus solely on states with higher prevalence rates but lower cross-border mobility into Mississippi."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico, we recommend implementing a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for travelers originating from Texas. While Arizona has a slightly higher infectious density (E+I)/Population of 0.000393 compared to Texas's 0.000068, Texas presents a significantly greater risk due to its massive inbound flow into New Mexico, averaging 69,252 individuals daily. In contrast, Arizona's daily inflow is only 25,816. Screening Texas would therefore capture an estimated 4.25 hidden infections (E+I) daily (0.000068 * 69252 * 0.9), preventing them from spreading within New Mexico, whereas screening Arizona would only capture about 9.1 hidden infections (0.000393 * 25816 * 0.9). Although Arizona has a higher E+I density, the sheer volume of travelers from Texas means that even with its lower density, the total number of potential infections imported from Texas is considerably higher. By targeting Texas, we are addressing the largest source of potential imported cases, maximizing the detection utility by converting a substantial number of 'hidden' E and I cases to Q. This strategy aims to mitigate the most impactful inflow risk, complementing regional efforts by focusing on the largest transmission pathway into our state rather than solely the highest density origin, which might be targeted by other states with direct borders to Arizona."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis focuses on identifying the origin state posing the highest risk of importing hidden infections into Texas, aiming to minimize future confirmed cases and deaths. Mississippi emerges as the primary candidate for targeted inbound screening. While Arizona has a slightly higher total population and thus a larger E+I count, Mississippi's infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, is significantly higher at 0.00174 compared to Arizona's 0.00039. This indicates a greater per-capita risk of infectious individuals traveling from Mississippi. Furthermore, Mississippi's inbound flow to Texas, at 24,904 daily, is substantial. Implementing a 90percent screening mandate on this flow would capture an estimated 43.1 hidden infections (E+I) daily, converting them to Q-status upon arrival. This action directly reduces the introduction of infectious individuals into the Texas population, preventing secondary spread. By targeting Mississippi, we are addressing a high-risk source with a significant inbound flow, which offers the most effective reduction in hidden infections compared to other states. This strategy focuses on a clear, high-impact source rather than diluting efforts across multiple states or selecting a lower-risk option."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The policy decision to implement targeted inbound screening for travelers from Mississippi is based on a comprehensive assessment of source risk profiles, detection utility, and strategic coordination. Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density ((E+I)/Population) among all potential origin states, standing at approximately 0.001738. This indicates a significantly higher per-capita risk of individuals carrying hidden infections (Exposed or Infected) entering Virginia. While states like Texas have a much larger daily inbound flow, their infectious density is considerably lower, leading to fewer estimated hidden infections per traveler. Implementing a 90percent screening mandate for Mississippi is projected to yield the highest detection utility, converting an estimated 5.38 hidden infections (E+I) into confirmed (Q) cases daily. This direct intervention on a high-density source is critical for minimizing the influx of infectious individuals who could otherwise contribute to community transmission within Virginia. This targeted approach prioritizes addressing a concentrated, high-risk source, effectively complementing any broader regional defense by focusing on the most potent per-capita threat, thereby aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia.'

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement Targeted Inbound Screening for New Mexico stems from a careful evaluation of source risk and detection utility. While Texas has the highest absolute inbound flow, its infectious density is relatively low (0.00009). Mississippi exhibits a higher infectious density (0.003), but its inbound flow to Arizona is minimal (1474). Virginia also presents a moderate infectious density (0.00075) and a moderate inflow (3556). New Mexico, however, presents a critical balance: it has the highest infectious density among all origin states (0.00027) when considering (E+I)/Population, and a significant daily inbound flow into Arizona (19789), second only to Texas. This combination makes it the most impactful target for intervention. By screening New Mexico, we estimate capturing approximately 144 hidden infections (E+I) daily (90percent of (639+130)/2829382 * 19789), converting them to Q-status. This strategy prioritizes capturing a substantial number of hidden infections from a state with a high relative infectious burden that contributes significantly to Arizona's inbound traffic, thereby mitigating the risk of disease importation and reducing future confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona. This approach balances the need to address high-risk sources without over-stretching resources on states with negligible inflow or very low infectious burdens."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement targeted inbound screening on Texas for the next two weeks is based on a multi-faceted risk assessment. Firstly, evaluating the source risk profile, Texas presents the highest 'Infectious Density' (E+I)/Population among all potential origin states, with a combined (E+I) of 2518 individuals in a population of approximately 28 million, resulting in a density of 8.96E-05. While Arizona has a higher E+I count (4175), its significantly larger population (7.5 million) results in a lower density (5.57E-04). However, the critical factor is the 'Detection Utility' and the sheer volume of inbound flow. Texas contributes the largest average daily inbound flow into Mississippi at 32,701. Applying the 90percent screening mandate to this flow, we estimate that approximately 0.9 * (2518 / 28081027) * 32701 = 2.62 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) would be captured and immediately converted to Q-status daily. This is a conservative estimate of direct prevention, but the broader impact of removing potential super-spreaders from the hidden infectious pool is significant. While Arizona has a higher E+I count, its inbound flow is considerably lower (1614), meaning the absolute number of detected hidden infections would be much smaller. This policy coordinates with the likely defensive strategies of other states, as Texas is a major hub. By targeting Texas, Mississippi addresses the most significant source of potential hidden infections based on the combination of infectious density and high mobility, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by intercepting a substantial number of otherwise undetected infectious individuals at the border."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The decision to target Texas for inbound screening is driven by a comprehensive assessment of risk and potential impact. While Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, its inbound flow to New Mexico is significantly lower than that from Texas. Texas, despite having a lower infectious density than Mississippi, contributes the largest number of inbound travelers, making it the most substantial source of potential imported infections. By implementing a 90percent screening mandate for travelers from Texas, we estimate capturing a significant number of hidden infections (E and I) that would otherwise spread undetected within New Mexico. This strategy aims to prevent a larger volume of potential cases from entering our state, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. This approach targets the highest volume risk, complementing efforts that might focus on higher density but lower volume sources, ensuring a broad and impactful reduction in disease importation.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='For the upcoming two-week period, a Targeted Inbound Screening policy is recommended for travelers originating from Mississippi. Our assessment of source risk profiles indicates that Mississippi presents the highest infectious density at approximately 0.0029, meaning a significant proportion of its population is currently exposed or infected. While New Mexico demonstrates the highest raw inbound traffic volume into Texas, its infectious density is considerably lower. Consequently, when considering the actual number of potentially hidden infectious individuals (E+I) entering Texas daily, Mississippi is the primary contributor, estimated at 76.38 daily E+I cases. Implementing the ninety percent screening mandate on Mississippi-originating travelers would lead to a substantial detection utility, converting an estimated 68.74 E/I individuals directly into the Confirmed (Q) compartment each day. Over the 14-day policy horizon, this translates to approximately 962 hidden infections being identified and isolated, thereby preventing their potential to initiate new chains of transmission within Texas. This strategy represents a direct and impactful intervention, focusing on the most critical source of imported hidden infections. This is not a secondary choice but a direct response to the state posing the highest risk of disease importation, maximizing our ability to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas by effectively reducing the hidden infectious population entering our communities.'

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement Targeted Inbound Screening on Texas for the next two weeks is driven by a multi-faceted risk assessment aimed at minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia. Firstly, evaluating the Source Risk Profile, Texas presents the highest Hidden Infections (E+I) count at 2518, significantly exceeding other states, despite its large population. While Mississippi has a higher (E+I)/Population density, Texas's absolute number of E+I is paramount when considering detection utility. Secondly, the Detection Utility for Texas is substantial; with a 90percent screening effectiveness, targeting Texas is estimated to convert approximately 2266 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) to Q-status upon arrival in Virginia over the 14-day period (15964 average daily inflow * 14 days * (2518 E+I / 28081027 total pop) * 0.90 screening effectiveness), preventing a significant number of silent spreaders from entering our community. This is a far greater number of potential Q-conversions compared to any other state, offering the most impactful reduction in imported disease. Finally, regarding Coordination vs. Competition, while other agents might also identify Texas as a high-volume origin, Virginia's choice to screen Texas is a direct response to its high absolute number of E+I and significant inbound flow into our state. This policy prioritizes capturing the largest potential source of undetected infection, thereby establishing a strong regional defense by addressing the most impactful vector for disease importation into Virginia. This targeted approach is expected to most effectively mitigate the systemic risks of disease importation and protect our population."

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis focuses on minimizing the importation of hidden infections (E and I) into Arizona. We calculated the infectious density ((E+I)/Population) for all potential origin states: Mississippi (0.0049), New Mexico (0.0002), Texas (0.0001), and Virginia (0.0009). While Mississippi shows the highest infectious density, New Mexico presents a unique risk profile due to its significantly higher daily inbound flow to Arizona (23,793, compared to Mississippi's 1,596). Despite New Mexico's lower individual infectious density, the sheer volume of travelers means a greater absolute number of potentially exposed or infected individuals could enter Arizona undetected. By targeting New Mexico, we estimate capturing approximately 72 hidden infections (0.90 * (663 E + 135 I) * (23793 / 3538501)), effectively converting them to Q status upon arrival. This strategy prioritizes the detection utility by focusing on the origin state that contributes the largest absolute number of hidden infections through high mobility, rather than just the highest infectious density. This decision reflects a coordinated approach to mitigate the most impactful inflow risk, preventing a substantial number of undetected cases from circulating and contributing to local spread within Arizona."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy on travelers from Texas is based on a quantitative assessment of potential disease importation risks and the effectiveness of the proposed intervention. While Texas exhibits the lowest "Infectious Density" ((E+I)/Population = 0.00011606) among the considered origin states, its significantly higher average daily inbound flow into Mississippi (38622 travelers) makes it the primary source of hidden infections. Our analysis indicates that screening Texas travelers would lead to the detection and conversion of approximately 4.04 hidden infections (E and I) to the Confirmed (Q) status daily. This is substantially higher than the next highest, Virginia (3.15 daily captured infections), despite Virginia having a much higher infectious density (0.0009522). The goal is to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by directly reducing the influx of individuals who could unknowingly spread the disease. By targeting Texas, we prioritize capturing the largest absolute number of hidden infections, thereby having the most significant impact on mitigating disease spread within Mississippi. This strategy focuses on maximizing the utility of the screening intervention where it can intercept the greatest volume of potential carriers, irrespective of their origin\'s individual risk density.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to target Mississippi for inbound screening is based on a comprehensive risk assessment. Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density among all potential origin states, with a combined (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.499percent. This indicates a significant hidden infectious population that poses a substantial risk of disease importation into New Mexico. By implementing a 90percent screening mandate for travelers from Mississippi, we estimate capturing a significant number of hidden infections (E and I) and converting them to Q status. Specifically, with an average daily inflow of 1241 travelers from Mississippi, and an estimated 6.64 'hidden' infected individuals per 1000 travelers, we project to capture and quarantine approximately 7.37 individuals daily (1241 * 0.00593 * 0.9 + 1241 * 0.004421 * 0.9). While Texas has a higher absolute inflow, its infectious density is significantly lower (0.0116percent), making Mississippi a more potent source of hidden infections relative to its population. This strategy prioritizes targeting the most concentrated source of hidden infections, which aligns with New Mexico's objective of minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by proactively identifying and isolating infected individuals at the point of entry. This choice represents a focused intervention on the highest risk-per-traveler state, rather than a state with simply high volume but lower per-capita risk."

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="After careful evaluation of potential origin states, the policy recommends implementing targeted inbound screening for travelers from New Mexico for the next 14 days. While Arizona and Mississippi present higher infectious densities, New Mexico stands out due to its significantly higher daily inbound flow into Texas. Although its infectious density is the lowest among the options, the sheer volume of travelers means that even a low density can translate into a substantial number of 'hidden infections' (E+I) entering Texas. By screening New Mexico, we project to capture approximately 144 hidden infections (663 E + 135 I = 798, 798 * (136934 / 3426790 population) * 0.90 screening efficiency) and convert them to Q-status upon arrival. This strategy prioritizes mitigating the largest incoming vector of potential disease spread, even if the individual risk per traveler is lower, thereby effectively reducing the overall importation risk. This approach balances the 'Infectious Density' with the 'Detection Utility' by focusing on the largest absolute number of potential E and I cases entering Texas, rather than just the highest per capita risk, which might be targeted by other states. This aims to fill a critical gap in regional defense by addressing a high-volume, albeit lower-density, source."

2025-12-24 20:39:07,447 - od_agent - INFO - Region virginia policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis focuses on minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia by strategically targeting inbound screening. We evaluate each origin state's 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population) and its average daily inbound flow into Virginia. Texas presents the highest risk profile due to its significantly large inbound flow (17,393 daily) compared to other states, despite having a relatively low infectious density (0.000078). While Mississippi has a higher infectious density (0.000499) and Arizona is moderate (0.000077), their inbound flows are considerably smaller (3,307 and 3,797 respectively). New Mexico has both low density (0.000233) and low flow (1,155). Targeting Texas allows us to capture the largest volume of potential hidden infections, even with a lower individual risk per traveler, due to the sheer scale of interaction. By screening 90percent of E and I travelers from Texas, we estimate a significant number of 'Hidden Infections' will be converted to Q-status, preventing their undetected spread within Virginia. This strategy prioritizes the state contributing the most to overall imported risk, ensuring a substantial reduction in potential disease transmission while acknowledging other agents might target states with higher per-capita infection rates but lower overall impact on Virginia."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for mississippi is based on a comprehensive risk assessment focusing on infectious density and potential hidden infections. Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density among all origin states, with an (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.00808. This indicates a significantly higher proportion of its population is currently exposed or infected compared to other states like New Mexico (0.00022), Texas (0.00017), and Virginia (0.00120). Despite a lower absolute daily inbound flow to arizona (1899 travelers) compared to Texas or New Mexico, the high infectious density from Mississippi translates to the greatest number of hidden infections (E and I) entering arizona. Specifically, screening 90percent of inbound travelers from Mississippi is estimated to capture approximately 13.81 hidden infections daily, which is more than double the number from any other state (New Mexico: 6.15, Texas: 6.51, Virginia: 6.49). Therefore, targeting Mississippi offers the most effective utility in detecting and converting these hidden infections into confirmed (Q) cases upon arrival, thereby minimizing the silent spread within arizona. This strategy prioritizes addressing the most concentrated source of undetected infection to mitigate cumulative confirmed cases and deaths, rather than merely focusing on states with higher overall traffic but lower infectious risk per traveler.'

2025-12-24 20:39:23,743 - od_agent - INFO - Region mississippi policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in mississippi, the policy recommends implementing Targeted Inbound Screening for travelers arriving from Texas. This decision is primarily driven by Texas's significant contribution to inbound flow into mississippi, coupled with its notable infectious density compared to other high-flow states. While Arizona exhibits a higher infectious density, its inbound flow to mississippi is considerably lower, making the impact of screening less substantial. New Mexico, despite a moderate infectious density, also has a lower inbound flow. Virginia has a relatively high infectious density but again, lower inflow than Texas. By targeting Texas, an estimated 200 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) are projected to be intercepted and converted to Q-status over the next 14 days, preventing their unmonitored integration into mississippi's population. This strategy prioritizes intercepting a large volume of potentially infectious individuals from the most significant inbound source, aiming to mitigate the risk of widespread community transmission and reduce the burden on mississippi's healthcare system. This approach balances the need to address high-risk sources with the practicalities of traffic volume, ensuring the intervention has a meaningful impact on disease control without over-stretching resources on lower-impact origins."

2025-12-24 20:39:30,847 - od_agent - INFO - Region new mexico policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis focuses on identifying the origin state that presents the highest risk of importing hidden infections (E and I) into New Mexico, considering both the infectious density and the volume of inbound travelers. Texas, despite having a lower infectious density (0.00016) compared to mississippi (0.00815), poses the most significant threat due to its overwhelmingly large inbound flow into New Mexico (101,339 individuals daily). While mississippi has a much higher infectious density, its inbound flow is negligible (1,324 daily). Screening Texas is projected to capture approximately 15.5 hidden infections daily (90percent of (E+I) from 101,339 travelers), a substantially higher number than any other state, including mississippi which would yield only about 9.7 hidden infections despite its high density (90percent of (E+I) from 1,324 travelers). By targeting Texas, we aim to intercept a large absolute number of asymptomatic carriers, thereby preventing a significant portion of potential community transmission within New Mexico. This strategy prioritizes the direct impact on New Mexico's case count by addressing the largest source of potential importation. This is a deliberate choice to target the primary inflow with a moderate infectious density rather than a smaller inflow with a higher density, ensuring the most impactful reduction in imported cases."

2025-12-24 20:39:48,417 - od_agent - INFO - Region texas policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The primary objective is to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in texas by reducing the importation of hidden infections (E and I). To achieve this, we analyzed the "Infectious Density" ((E+I)/Population) and the average daily inbound flow from each potential origin state. Among the candidate states, mississippi presents the highest risk profile with an infectious density of approximately 0.0080, significantly higher than arizona (0.0010), virginia (0.0012), and new mexico (0.0002). Despite new mexico having a higher average daily inbound flow, mississippi\'s elevated infectious density means its travelers carry a disproportionately high number of exposed and infected individuals. Specifically, mississippi\'s daily inbound flow to texas is estimated to contain around 304 hidden infections (E and I). Implementing a ninety percent screening mandate for travelers from mississippi would effectively identify and move approximately 274 of these individuals daily directly into the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival. This action would prevent these highly infectious individuals from circulating within texas, thereby significantly reducing potential local transmission chains. This targeted intervention focuses on the most impactful source of hidden infections, directly addressing the highest risk to texas\'s population, rather than simply targeting the state with the highest overall inbound traffic. This strategic choice is crucial for maximizing the utility of the screening policy and protecting public health in texas.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The policy targets Mississippi for inbound screening due to its significantly high infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population. Mississippi's infectious density stands at 0.008041, which is substantially higher than other potential origin states, indicating a greater proportion of exposed and infected individuals within its population. This elevated risk profile means travelers from Mississippi are more likely to carry the disease. Implementing a 90percent screening mandate for inbound traffic from Mississippi is projected to yield the highest detection utility, capturing approximately 30.25 hidden infections (E and I) daily and converting them to confirmed (Q) cases upon arrival. This action directly reduces the influx of undetected carriers into Virginia, thereby mitigating potential community spread. While other states like Texas have higher inbound traffic volumes, their comparatively low infectious densities mean that screening them would capture fewer hidden infections. This targeted approach prioritizes maximum impact on disease control by focusing on the source with the highest concentration of hidden infections, rather than simply the largest flow, ensuring efficient resource allocation and a robust defense against disease importation."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement targeted inbound screening on Texas is based on a multi-faceted risk assessment. While Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density with an (E+I)/Pop ratio of approximately 0.0046, its average daily inbound flow into Arizona is relatively low at 2382. New Mexico has a low infectious density and a moderate inflow. Texas, on the other hand, presents a significant risk due to its substantial average daily inbound flow of 48951 travelers, which is by far the highest among all potential origin states. Although its infectious density is lower than Mississippi's at approximately 0.00019, the sheer volume of travelers means that a higher absolute number of hidden infections (E+I) are likely to be imported from Texas. Implementing a 90percent screening mandate on this high-volume corridor is projected to capture a considerable number of otherwise undetected exposed and infected individuals, converting them to confirmed (Q) cases upon arrival. This proactive detection strategy minimizes the spread within Arizona by immediately isolating infected individuals who would otherwise contribute to community transmission. This choice prioritizes intercepting a large potential influx of disease, even if the per-capita risk of the origin state is not the absolute highest, thereby maximizing the overall impact on reducing cumulative cases and deaths in Arizona."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for travelers originating from Texas is based on a comprehensive risk assessment prioritizing the minimization of cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi. Firstly, evaluating the Source Risk Profile, while Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density (0.001516), Texas, despite a lower individual infectious density (0.000213), presents the greatest absolute risk due to its significantly higher average daily inbound flow into Mississippi (52,561 travelers, compared to 2,607 from Arizona, 1,954 from New Mexico, and 4,702 from Virginia). This high volume translates to the largest number of 'Hidden Infections' (E and I individuals) entering Mississippi from any single origin state, estimated at 11.178 per day from Texas. Secondly, the Detection Utility of screening Texas is paramount. A 90percent screening mandate would effectively identify and convert approximately 10.06 'Hidden Infections' from Texas daily into the 'Confirmed (Q)' compartment. This is substantially higher than the 2.96 detections from Arizona, 0.41 from New Mexico, or 6.41 from Virginia, directly preventing these individuals from silently contributing to community spread within Mississippi. Lastly, regarding Coordination vs. Competition, this intervention strategically targets the most impactful source of imported cases. By focusing on Texas, Mississippi addresses the primary vector for disease importation in absolute terms, ensuring that limited screening resources are allocated where they will yield the greatest reduction in potential new infections, rather than merely addressing the state with the highest per-capita infection rate if its overall contribution to inbound risk is lower."

 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement targeted inbound screening for travelers from Arizona is based on a comprehensive assessment of source risk profiles and the potential utility of detection. While Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density (E+I)/Population, its relatively low daily inbound flow into New Mexico limits the overall number of hidden infections that could be intercepted. Conversely, Texas has the largest inbound flow, but its very low infectious density means that screening would yield fewer identified cases. Arizona, however, presents a critical intersection of moderate infectious density and a substantial daily inbound flow. By implementing a 90percent screening mandate for travelers from Arizona, an estimated 43.93 hidden infections (Exposed and Infected individuals) would be identified and moved into the Confirmed (Q) compartment daily. This figure represents the highest potential conversion of undetected cases to confirmed cases among all origin states, significantly reducing the hidden infectious population entering New Mexico. This targeted approach is not necessarily about competing with other states for the 'most dangerous' origin, but rather about strategically allocating resources where they can most effectively mitigate the risk of disease importation and minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths within New Mexico by addressing the most impactful source of hidden infections."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement targeted inbound screening for Mississippi is based on a comprehensive risk assessment. Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density among all candidate origin states, with a significant (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.0128. This elevated density suggests a high probability of importing hidden infections into Texas. By targeting Mississippi, we estimate that approximately 29,252 hidden infections (E and I) will be captured and converted to Q-status upon arrival over the next two weeks. This proactive screening will substantially reduce the number of undetected infectious individuals circulating within Texas, thereby mitigating potential local transmission and ultimately minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. While other states like Arizona also present a risk, Mississippi's infectious density and substantial average daily inflow into Texas make it the primary concern for effective intervention. This strategy prioritizes addressing the most potent source of hidden viral importation, thereby maximizing the utility of our single-state screening capacity."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis focuses on minimizing imported disease burden, specifically targeting hidden infections (E and I) that could otherwise seed new outbreaks within Virginia. We evaluated each origin state's infectious density and the potential for detection utility. Mississippi presents the highest infectious density with (20552 E + 9773 I) / 2390281 Population = 1.27percent among all potential origin states, significantly higher than Arizona (0.12percent), New Mexico (0.02percent), and Texas (0.02percent). While Mississippi's average daily inbound flow into Virginia (4198) is not the largest, the high infectious density means that a substantial number of 'hidden' E and I cases are likely to enter Virginia if unchecked. Implementing a ninety percent screening policy for Mississippi would effectively convert an estimated 90percent of these incoming E and I individuals into Q status upon arrival, thereby preventing them from circulating and spreading the disease within Virginia's susceptible population. This targeted intervention on Mississippi, despite Texas having a higher absolute inbound flow, is a strategic choice focused on mitigating the highest per-capita risk source. This approach prioritizes reducing the most concentrated infection threat, rather than simply the largest volume of travelers, ensuring our resources are deployed where they can have the most significant impact on preventing disease transmission. This decision aims to fill a critical gap in regional defense by addressing a high-risk origin that might otherwise be overlooked if only raw inflow numbers were considered, thereby complementing broader efforts and minimizing competition for screening resources on states with lower infectious densities."

2025-12-24 20:41:27,111 - od_agent - INFO - Region arizona policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for travelers arriving from mississippi for the next two weeks is based on a comprehensive risk assessment focusing on minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths within arizona. Firstly, the Source Risk Profile was evaluated by calculating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for all potential origin states. Mississippi exhibited a significantly higher infectious density of approximately 0.0187, compared to virginia (0.0019), new mexico (0.00024), and texas (0.00022). This indicates that a substantially larger proportion of mississippi's population is currently exposed or actively infected. Secondly, we assessed the Detection Utility, estimating the number of 'Hidden Infections' (E and I individuals) that would be captured and converted to Q-status through the rigorous ninety percent screening. Despite mississippi not having the highest overall daily inbound flow to arizona, its high infectious density results in the highest estimated daily inflow of hidden infections, at approximately 48.5 individuals. Implementing the screening would lead to the immediate isolation of about 43.7 such individuals daily, significantly reducing the hidden infectious population entering arizona. This cumulative conversion of over 610 hidden infections over the 14-day period is substantially greater than the potential conversions from other states (e.g., texas ~10, virginia ~9.8, new mexico ~6.6 daily). This strategy directly addresses the primary source of high-risk importation. As there is no information on other agents' policies, targeting mississippi is the most direct and impactful approach to protect arizona by isolating the most significant source of incoming hidden infections, which aligns with the objective of minimizing disease spread."

2025-12-24 20:41:45,274 - od_agent - INFO - Region mississippi policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement targeted inbound screening on Texas is primarily driven by the objective to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in mississippi, focusing on the highest potential for disease importation. While Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density (0.00189) and Arizona is second (0.00158), Texas, despite its lower infectious density (0.00022), presents the most significant risk due to its exceptionally high average daily inbound flow into mississippi (60,331 travelers). This high volume translates to the largest number of 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) potentially entering mississippi undetected. Specifically, screening Texas would allow for the detection and Q-conversion of approximately 12.09 E+I individuals daily, a substantially higher number compared to Virginia (9.17 daily), Arizona (3.48 daily), or New Mexico (0.36 daily). This policy prioritizes intercepting the largest absolute number of hidden infections, which is critical for reducing local transmission and mitigating the overall epidemic impact within mississippi. This strategic focus on the highest volume contributor ensures that the intervention provides the maximum utility in converting potential spreaders into confirmed, isolated cases, thereby proactively protecting mississippi's population. This decision is not necessarily a competitive one but a pragmatic choice based on mississippi's specific inbound mobility patterns and the direct calculation of potential imported cases."

2025-12-24 20:41:50,878 - od_agent - INFO - Region new mexico policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to target Texas for inbound screening is driven by a comprehensive risk assessment. While Texas exhibits a lower (E+I)/Population density compared to Mississippi, its sheer volume of daily inbound flow into New Mexico (132,778 travelers) presents a significantly higher absolute number of potential hidden infections. Specifically, targeting Texas is projected to intercept approximately 3,061 hidden infections (E+I) over the 14-day period, converting them to Q-status upon arrival. This is substantially more impactful than screening Mississippi, which, despite a higher infectious density, has a much smaller inbound flow (1,605 travelers), yielding only about 50 intercepted hidden infections. Arizona also has a relatively low infectious density and moderate flow, making its screening less critical than Texas. This strategy prioritizes the largest source of imported risk, aiming to prevent a significant influx of undetected cases that could exacerbate New Mexico's epidemic trajectory. This approach focuses on reducing the most substantial external contribution to New Mexico's case burden, rather than competing for a high-density, low-flow state that might be targeted by other regions."

2025-12-24 20:41:56,497 - od_agent - INFO - Region texas policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis focuses on identifying the highest risk states based on their 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population) combined with their average daily inbound flow into Texas. Mississippi presents the highest infectious density at 1.94percent, significantly higher than Arizona (0.16percent), New Mexico (0.02percent), and Virginia (0.19percent). Despite New Mexico having the highest inbound flow, its infectious density is very low. While Arizona also has a substantial inbound flow, its infectious density is moderate. By targeting Mississippi, we estimate capturing approximately 780 'hidden' infections (E and I) per day, converting them to Q-status. This proactive screening of a high-density, moderate-flow source minimizes the importation of undetected carriers, thereby reducing the potential for new local transmissions in Texas. This strategy prioritizes mitigating a concentrated source of infection, rather than diluting efforts across multiple states or states with lower infectious densities, ensuring effective resource allocation to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to target Mississippi for inbound screening is driven by a comprehensive risk assessment focusing on infectious density, detection utility, and strategic coordination. Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density among all origin states, with a combined (E+I)/Population of approximately 1.88percent, significantly exceeding Arizona (0.16percent), New Mexico (0.02percent), and Texas (0.02percent). This high concentration of hidden infections makes Mississippi the most potent source of disease importation risk. The proposed ninety percent screening policy would be highly effective in converting a substantial number of these hidden infections (E and I) into Confirmed (Q) cases upon arrival, thereby preventing their unmitigated spread within Virginia. With an average daily inbound flow of 4,459 travelers from Mississippi, approximately 84 individuals (4459 * 0.0188) are likely to be E or I. Screening 90percent of these would convert about 76 individuals to Q, drastically reducing the infectious pressure on Virginia's healthcare system and community. While Texas has a much larger inbound flow, its infectious density is remarkably low, making screening less impactful there. This targeted approach prioritizes addressing the most concentrated source of infection, rather than simply the largest flow, thereby maximizing the reduction in imported disease burden for Virginia."

2025-12-24 20:42:14,810 - od_agent - INFO - Region arizona policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for travelers originating from mississippi is based on a comprehensive risk assessment focusing on the potential for disease importation into arizona. Firstly, mississippi presents the highest 'Infectious Density' among all origin states, with approximately 2.7percent of its population currently in the Exposed (E) or Infected (I) compartments. This significantly surpasses the infectious densities observed in virginia (0.24percent), new mexico (0.028percent), and texas (0.024percent), marking mississippi as the primary source risk. Secondly, despite having a moderate inbound flow compared to states like new mexico or texas, mississippi's high infectious density translates to the largest number of 'hidden infections' (E and I individuals) entering arizona daily, estimated at around 63 individuals. Implementing a 90percent screening mandate for these travelers is projected to effectively convert approximately 57 of these hidden infections directly into the Confirmed (Q) compartment daily. This measure is crucial for minimizing the undetected spread within arizona, as these individuals would otherwise contribute to the local transmission chain. This intervention is a targeted effort to address the most impactful source of imported cases, rather than simply focusing on states with the highest traffic volume but lower individual risk. By prioritizing mississippi, arizona aims to maximize the utility of its screening resources to mitigate the immediate threat of disease importation and safeguard its public health."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for travelers from Texas is based on a comprehensive risk assessment. While Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density (E+I)/Population at 0.00237, Texas, despite a lower infectious density of 0.000239, has an overwhelmingly higher average daily inbound flow into Mississippi (63,448 travelers compared to Virginia's 6,108). When considering the combined impact of infectious density and mobility, targeting Texas is projected to yield the highest number of 'Hidden Infections' (Exposed and Infected individuals) converted to Confirmed (Q) status upon arrival, estimated at 13.62 individuals per day. This significantly surpasses the 13.02 individuals per day from Virginia, 4.96 from Arizona, and 0.39 from New Mexico. By focusing on Texas, Mississippi prioritizes intercepting the largest absolute number of potentially infectious individuals entering the state, thereby substantially reducing the risk of new transmission chains. This strategy minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by addressing the most significant vector for disease importation, aligning with a primary defense against systemic risks despite the possibility of other agents targeting the same high-traffic origin."

2025-12-24 20:42:36,883 - od_agent - INFO - Region new mexico policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="New Mexico's policy decision targets Mississippi for enhanced inbound screening due to its significantly higher infectious density and substantial number of hidden infections (E+I) compared to other potential origin states. While Texas has the largest baseline inflow, its infectious density is remarkably low, making the impact of screening less pronounced. Arizona and Virginia also present lower infectious densities than Mississippi. By focusing on Mississippi, we aim to capture a greater number of exposed and infected individuals at the border, converting them to 'Q' status and thereby preventing further community transmission within New Mexico. This strategy prioritizes the reduction of systemic risk from the most infectious source, effectively minimizing the importation of hidden cases and contributing to a lower cumulative case and death count within New Mexico. This targeted approach allows New Mexico to address a critical source of potential infection without unnecessarily restricting other, lower-risk inbound flows."

2025-12-24 20:42:52,930 - od_agent - INFO - Region texas policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for travelers originating from Mississippi for the next two weeks is based on a comprehensive risk assessment. Mississippi exhibits the highest "Infectious Density" among all evaluated origin states, with approximately 2.7percent of its population currently in the Exposed (E) or Infected (I) compartments. This significantly elevated risk profile makes Mississippi the most critical source of potential disease importation. The targeted screening is projected to have substantial "Detection Utility," effectively capturing an estimated 881 hidden infections (E and I) daily from Mississippi\'s inbound flow into Texas, converting them to the Confirmed (Q) status upon arrival. This number is considerably higher than the potential captures from any other single state, demonstrating the policy\'s maximum impact on reducing the influx of infectious individuals. In terms of "Coordination vs. Competition," this policy directly addresses the most significant and evident threat of disease importation identified through our analysis. While other states may also be evaluating their own high-risk origins, targeting Mississippi represents the most impactful single intervention for Texas, ensuring that the state\'s resources are strategically deployed to mitigate the highest identified risk and minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths.'

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The policy decision for the next two weeks focuses on minimizing the importation of hidden infections into Virginia. To achieve this, we evaluated the 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population) for each potential origin state. Texas presented the highest daily inbound flow to Virginia (28,822), and while its individual infectious density (0.00029) was not the absolute highest, the sheer volume of travelers means that even a moderate density translates to a significant number of potential hidden infections. Specifically, targeting Texas would allow us to convert an estimated 90percent of the 8.4 (E+I) individuals entering daily from Texas into the Confirmed (Q) compartment. This 'Detection Utility' is crucial as it prevents these individuals from silently spreading the disease within Virginia. Other states like Mississippi had a higher infectious density (0.028), but their inbound flow was significantly lower (4,848), resulting in a smaller absolute number of hidden infections (1.8 E+I) to be captured. Arizona also had a higher inflow than Mississippi but a lower infectious density, leading to fewer hidden infections (0.6 E+I) than Texas. New Mexico had both low density and low inflow, making it a lesser priority. By selecting Texas, we are prioritizing the origin state that, due to its high mobility volume, poses the most significant systemic risk of importing a substantial number of undetected infections, thereby strategically leveraging our limited screening capacity to maximize public health benefit for Virginia. This approach demonstrates a focus on addressing the most impactful source of potential disease importation rather than solely the highest density, which aligns with a strategy of coordinating efforts to mitigate the largest flow-based risks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for travelers from Mississippi is driven by a comprehensive assessment of source risk, detection utility, and strategic impact. Mississippi exhibits the highest Infectious Density among all origin states, with approximately 3.68percent of its population currently in the Exposed (E) or Infected (I) compartments. Although Mississippi's daily inbound flow to Arizona (2348 individuals) is not the highest in absolute terms, its high infectious density translates to an estimated 86.49 'hidden infections' (E+I) entering Arizona daily. Implementing a 90percent screening mandate for these travelers is projected to convert approximately 77.84 E/I individuals into the Confirmed (Q) compartment each day. This is a significantly higher number of detected hidden infections compared to New Mexico (7.47), Texas (10.55), or Virginia (16.41), despite New Mexico and Texas having higher overall inbound flows. By targeting Mississippi, Arizona can proactively identify and isolate the largest influx of potential community spreaders, thereby minimizing the systemic risk of disease importation and reducing future cumulative confirmed cases and deaths within the state. This strategic choice focuses on the most potent source of hidden infections rather than merely the largest volume of traffic, ensuring the most effective use of screening resources."

2025-12-24 20:43:36,940 - od_agent - INFO - Region mississippi policy response:
 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The policy decision to implement Targeted Inbound Screening for travelers arriving from Virginia is based on a comprehensive risk assessment. Regarding the **Source Risk Profile**, Virginia currently presents the highest infectious density among all potential origin states, with approximately 0.0030251 of its population in the Exposed (E) or Infected (I) compartments. This indicates a higher probability of encountering an infectious individual from this origin. For **Detection Utility**, screening travelers from Virginia is projected to be the most effective intervention. Based on current inflow rates and Virginia's infectious density, an estimated 14.36 hidden infections (E and I) would be identified and moved into the Confirmed (Q) compartment daily. This significantly surpasses the potential detections from other states, such as Texas (13.04 daily) or Arizona (5.23 daily), making Virginia the most impactful target for reducing the influx of undetected cases into mississippi. In terms of **Coordination vs. Competition**, this selection represents a strategic focus on the primary source of hidden infections impacting mississippi directly. While other states may also identify high-risk origins, our priority is to mitigate the most significant risk to our own population, ensuring that mississippi effectively intercepts the largest potential inflow of infectious individuals, thereby minimizing future cumulative confirmed cases and deaths within our borders."

2025-12-24 20:43:43,275 - od_agent - INFO - Region new mexico policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico, we recommend implementing a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for Texas. Evaluating the Source Risk Profile, Texas exhibits a significant 'Infectious Density' of 0.000251 ((2457+3973)/25105960), which is lower than Mississippi but higher than Arizona. However, the crucial factor is the immense baseline daily inbound flow from Texas to New Mexico (119,576). This large volume translates into a substantial number of potential hidden infections entering our state. The Detection Utility of screening Texas is paramount: with a 90percent screening mandate, we estimate capturing approximately 58 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) daily from Texas (0.90 * (2457+3973) * (119576 / 25105960)). This is significantly higher than the potential captures from Mississippi (0.90 * (37120+17794) * (1638 / 1375026) = 60.3) or Arizona (0.90 * (20116+1284) * (34721 / 8807503) = 129.2), despite Mississippi and Arizona having higher infectious densities. Mississippi's inbound flow is too low to make a substantial impact, and while Arizona has a higher E+I component, Texas's sheer volume of travelers makes it the most impactful target for intervention. This decision reflects a Coordination vs. Competition strategy by targeting the largest source of potential importation, rather than solely the highest infectious density, to maximize the reduction of imported cases and protect New Mexico's population."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The policy for the next 2-week horizon is to implement Targeted Inbound Screening for travelers arriving from mississippi. This decision is based on a comprehensive risk assessment of all potential origin states. Mississippi exhibits the highest Source Risk Profile, with an infectious density of approximately 0.0368, significantly higher than other states like virginia (0.0030), arizona (0.0024), and new mexico (0.0003). This indicates a much larger proportion of its population is currently exposed or infected. Furthermore, considering the average daily inbound flow from mississippi to texas (33,936 travelers), the estimated number of 'Hidden Infections' (E+I individuals) entering texas from mississippi is approximately 1250 per day. Implementing a ninety percent screening mandate for these travelers would result in a Detection Utility of approximately 1125 individuals being moved from E/I to Q status daily. This is substantially higher than the potential Q-conversion from any other state, making mississippi the primary contributor of hidden infections to texas. By targeting mississippi, we directly address the most significant source of disease importation, maximizing the reduction in new hidden infections and thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in texas. This is a direct approach to mitigating the highest identified risk, rather than attempting to fill a secondary gap."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The policy decision for the next two weeks focuses on minimizing the importation of hidden infections into Virginia. To achieve this, we evaluated the infectious density (E+I)/Population for all potential origin states. Mississippi presents the highest infectious density at approximately 4.09percent, significantly higher than Arizona (0.40percent), New Mexico (0.03percent), and Texas (0.02percent). While the baseline inbound flow from Mississippi (4413 travelers/day) is not the highest, its high infectious density means that a substantial number of 'hidden infections' (E and I) are likely to enter Virginia daily. Specifically, an estimated 246 hidden infections (E+I) per day would arrive from Mississippi without intervention, compared to 20 from Arizona, 0 from New Mexico, and 2 from Texas. By implementing a 90percent screening policy on Mississippi, we anticipate converting approximately 221 of these hidden infections into confirmed (Q) cases upon arrival, effectively preventing them from circulating and spreading disease within Virginia. This targeted approach focuses on the most potent source of hidden viral load relative to its population, aiming to preemptively neutralize a significant threat and thereby minimize future confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia. This strategy prioritizes the state with the highest internal infectious pressure, ensuring that resources are directed where they can have the most impact on reducing imported disease burden."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in arizona, we recommend implementing a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for mississippi for the next 14 days. Evaluating the Source Risk Profile, mississippi presents the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population = (38416+18610)/1092011 = 0.0522, significantly higher than new mexico (0.00038), texas (0.00027), and virginia (0.00397). While new mexico and texas have higher baseline inbound flows to arizona, their infectious densities are comparatively very low. The Detection Utility of screening mississippi travelers is substantial: with an average daily inflow of 1984, 90percent screening would capture an estimated 92.9 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) daily, converting them to Q-status upon arrival. This is calculated as 1984 * 0.90 * ((38416+18610)/(1092011 + 38416 + 18610 + 12883 + 63545 + 2162)) = 92.9. This number is significantly higher than what would be captured from new mexico (24321 * 0.90 * 0.00038 = 8.3) or texas (44848 * 0.90 * 0.00027 = 10.9). In terms of Coordination vs. Competition, while other states might target high-flow states like texas, arizona's strategy focuses on the highest *risk per traveler*, ensuring a more efficient reduction of imported hidden infections. This targeted approach aims to prevent a significant influx of potentially infectious individuals from a high-prevalence region, thereby mitigating disease spread within arizona."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for virginia is based on a comprehensive risk assessment prioritizing the minimization of cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in mississippi. 1. **Source Risk Profile:** virginia exhibits the highest infectious density (E+I)/Population at approximately 0.003851 among all potential origin states. This indicates a higher inherent risk of travelers from virginia being in exposed or infected states upon arrival. 2. **Detection Utility:** By screening inbound travelers from virginia, an estimated 16.94 "hidden" infections (E and I individuals) would be identified and converted to the Confirmed (Q) compartment daily. This represents the highest potential daily detection rate compared to screening any other single state, significantly reducing the influx of undetected infectious individuals into mississippi\'s population. For comparison, screening texas, despite its much larger inbound flow, would only yield approximately 12.45 daily detections due to its lower infectious density. 3. **Coordination vs. Competition:** While texas contributes the largest absolute number of inbound travelers, its lower infectious density makes it a less efficient target for screening, in terms of \'Q-conversion\' per traveler, than virginia. Focusing on virginia allows mississippi to target the most potent source of hidden infections, effectively mitigating a high-risk vector of disease importation. This strategic choice prioritizes impact over sheer volume, ensuring that the limited screening resources are applied where they can have the greatest effect on disease control within mississippi, preventing further spread from these identified individuals.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement targeted inbound screening on Mississippi is driven by a comprehensive risk assessment. Mississippi exhibits the highest 'Infectious Density' (E+I)/Population among all potential origin states, with a value of approximately 0.052, significantly higher than Texas (0.00027), Arizona (0.0029), or Virginia (0.0039). While Mississippi's absolute inbound flow to New Mexico is not the largest, its extremely high prevalence of exposed and infected individuals poses a disproportionate risk of disease importation. By targeting Mississippi, we estimate capturing the largest number of 'Hidden Infections' (E+I converted to Q) relative to its flow, thereby preventing a substantial influx of undetected cases that could seed new outbreaks in New Mexico. This strategy prioritizes mitigating the most concentrated source of infectious individuals, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by intercepting a high-risk population flow. This approach targets a distinct high-risk profile, complementing potential actions by other states that might focus on larger, but less infectious, inbound flows."

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis focuses on minimizing the importation of hidden infections (E and I) into Texas. We first calculated the 'Infectious Density' for each potential origin state. New Mexico, despite having the lowest raw average E+I, presents a significant risk when considering its population size, yielding a density of 0.000388. Mississippi had the highest density at 0.052, followed by Arizona at 0.0029, and Virginia at 0.0039. The next critical step was to estimate the number of 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) that would be captured by a 90percent screening mandate, based on the baseline inbound flow from each state. While Mississippi shows a very high infectious density, its baseline inbound flow to Texas is relatively low (31,542), leading to an estimated capture of 1,480 E+I individuals. Arizona, with a higher flow (44,249) but lower density, would capture 116 E+I. Virginia, with a moderate flow (25,141) and density, would capture 90 E+I. However, New Mexico, despite its low infectious density, has a very high baseline inbound flow to Texas (139,917). Implementing screening on New Mexico travelers is projected to capture approximately 471 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) (0.9 * 139917 * 0.000378 = 471). This strategy aims to target a state with a substantial travel volume where screening can still yield a meaningful reduction in undetected infectious individuals, complementing potential efforts by other states to restrict higher-density sources. Therefore, we recommend targeting New Mexico to convert these hidden infections to the Q compartment, thereby mitigating their spread within Texas."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement Targeted Inbound Screening for Mississippi is strategically aimed at minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia. Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density among all candidate states, with an (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.054 (56926 / 1092011). This significantly surpasses the infectious densities of Arizona (~0.0029), New Mexico (~0.00038), and Texas (~0.00027). Furthermore, Mississippi's baseline average daily inbound flow into Virginia is substantial at 3879 travelers. By screening travelers from Mississippi, we estimate that approximately 56926 * (3879 / 1092011) * 0.9 = 182 hidden infections (E and I) will be captured and converted to Q status over the 14-day period. This direct intervention on the highest-risk source is a critical measure to prevent a surge in local transmission within Virginia. While other states like Texas have higher absolute inflow, their significantly lower infectious densities make them less impactful targets for this specific type of screening. This choice represents targeting the most potent source of hidden infections, directly addressing the highest risk profile to bolster Virginia's defense against disease importation."

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis focuses on minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona. We evaluated the infectious density (E+I)/Population for all potential origin states. Mississippi presents the highest infectious density at 5.25percent, followed by Virginia at 0.49percent, New Mexico at 0.04percent, and Texas at 0.05percent. While Mississippi has the highest infectious density, its average daily inbound flow into Arizona is relatively low at 1831 travelers. New Mexico, despite having a lower infectious density (0.04percent), has a significantly higher average daily inbound flow of 26310 travelers. The estimated number of hidden infections (E+I) from New Mexico, if 90percent were screened and converted, would be approximately 10.74 (0.04percent of 26310), which is a substantial reduction for a high-volume corridor. Texas also has a high inbound flow (45155) but a slightly higher infectious density (0.05percent), leading to an estimated 24.16 hidden infections. However, New Mexico's overall population is smaller, and its proportion of (E+I) within its total population is lower compared to Mississippi, making the impact of screening its higher flow more targeted and efficient for Arizona. By targeting New Mexico, we are not necessarily picking the state with the highest *proportion* of infection, but rather the state that presents a significant *absolute number* of hidden infections due to its high inbound volume, which can be effectively mitigated by the 90percent screening. This strategy aims to capture a considerable number of hidden cases from a major entry point, thereby reducing the seeding of new infections in Arizona while balancing the impact of intervention with the volume of incoming traffic."

2025-12-24 20:45:39,014 - od_agent - INFO - Region mississippi policy response:
 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for Virginia is based on a comprehensive risk assessment aimed at minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in mississippi. The Source Risk Profile analysis reveals that Virginia has the highest infectious density among all potential origin states, with an (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.004742. This significantly surpasses Arizona (0.003745), Texas (0.000485), and New Mexico (0.000456), indicating a higher probability of infected or exposed individuals within its traveling population. The Detection Utility of this policy is substantial: Virginia contributes an estimated 26.52 hidden infections (E+I) daily to mississippi's inbound flow. Implementing a 90percent screening mandate on travelers from Virginia is projected to convert approximately 23.87 individuals from the Exposed (E) or Infected (I) compartments directly into the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival each day. This proactive interception is crucial for preventing these individuals from contributing to local transmission chains. Although Texas has a higher total inbound flow, its lower infectious density results in a slightly smaller number of hidden infections (23.16) compared to Virginia, making Virginia the marginally more impactful target for intervention. Regarding Coordination vs. Competition, this policy is a strategic, self-serving measure for mississippi, addressing its most significant single source of imported hidden infections. By isolating these cases at the border, mississippi directly reduces its internal disease burden, contributing to overall regional health stability by preventing further spread from a high-risk source."

 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to target Arizona for inbound screening is driven by a comprehensive risk assessment. Arizona presents the highest infectious density among all origin states, with a combined (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.0037. This elevated density indicates a higher probability of infected individuals entering New Mexico. Furthermore, Arizona also contributes the largest average daily inbound flow to New Mexico, meaning a greater absolute number of potentially infectious individuals are arriving from this state. By implementing a 90percent screening mandate, we estimate capturing a significant number of 'hidden infections' (E and I) from Arizona, converting them to the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival. This strategy aims to prevent these individuals from silently spreading the disease within New Mexico's susceptible population, thereby directly minimizing future confirmed cases and deaths. While other states like Mississippi have high infectious density, their inbound flow to New Mexico is significantly lower, making Arizona the primary source of imported risk to address. This targeted approach focuses resources on the most impactful origin, aligning with a strategy of mitigating the most significant external threat to New Mexico's public health."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The decision to implement Targeted Inbound Screening on travelers from Mississippi is primarily driven by its significantly high infectious density and the potential for substantial hidden infection importation. Mississippi presents the highest (E+I)/Population ratio at 0.062, indicating a widespread presence of hidden infections within its population. While other states like arizona and virginia also have notable E+I populations, their overall population sizes dilute their infectious density compared to Mississippi. New Mexico, conversely, has a very low infectious density. By targeting Mississippi, we estimate capturing approximately 5253 hidden infections (E+I) that would otherwise enter texas and contribute to community spread. This strategy aims to proactively convert these E and I individuals into Q status upon arrival, thereby preventing them from spreading the disease within texas. This is a strategic choice to target the most concentrated source of potential infection, rather than competing with other states for the most populous or highest absolute E+I states, ensuring a focused and impactful intervention to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in texas.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="After evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for all potential origin states, Mississippi presents the highest risk profile with an infectious density of approximately 0.0625, significantly higher than Arizona (0.0038), Texas (0.0004), and New Mexico (0.0004). This indicates a substantially larger proportion of hidden infections (Exposed and Infected individuals) within Mississippi's population. The baseline inbound flow from Mississippi to Virginia is 3963 individuals per day. Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy on Mississippi would allow for approximately 90percent of the 310 (E+I) individuals expected to arrive from this state to be detected and moved into the Confirmed (Q) compartment. This intervention directly addresses the most significant source of imported hidden infections, thereby reducing the potential for undetected community transmission within Virginia. While other states contribute more to total inbound flow, their infectious densities are considerably lower, making Mississippi the most impactful choice for screening to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia. This strategy focuses on the highest risk per traveler, rather than simply the highest volume of travelers, to maximize the utility of screening resources and mitigate the risk of disease importation."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for travelers from mississippi is based on a comprehensive risk assessment focusing on infectious density and potential Q-conversion. mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density among all candidate origin states, with an (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.0518. This significantly elevated prevalence indicates a higher likelihood of infected or exposed individuals traveling from this region. Despite having a moderate daily inbound flow into arizona (1898 travelers), the high infectious density translates to an estimated 98.33 hidden infections (E and I) entering arizona daily from mississippi. By implementing a 90percent screening mandate, we project to convert approximately 88.50 of these hidden infections into confirmed (Q) cases each day. This is the highest potential daily Q-conversion compared to other states: new mexico (12.59), texas (23.00), and virginia (30.93). This strategy prioritizes the origin state that, per traveler, poses the greatest risk of undetected disease importation, thereby maximizing the utility of our screening efforts. By proactively identifying and isolating these cases upon arrival, we aim to significantly reduce the introduction of new chains of transmission within arizona, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths over the next two weeks. This approach targets the most obvious high-risk source, addressing the most potent threat of disease importation effectively.'

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for Virginia is based on a comprehensive evaluation of source risk and detection utility. Virginia presents the highest Source Risk Profile, with an infectious density (E+I)/Population of approximately 0.005775, indicating a higher proportion of potentially infectious individuals within its population compared to other origin states. The Detection Utility of screening travelers from Virginia is also the highest, estimated to capture approximately 25.54 hidden infections (E and I) per day. This significant number stems from Virginia's elevated infectious density combined with a substantial daily inbound flow of 4911 travelers into Mississippi. While Texas has a much larger inbound flow, Virginia's higher infectious density makes it the most effective target for reducing the influx of 'hidden' cases. This strategy prioritizes directly mitigating the most potent source of disease importation to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi, focusing on the most impactful intervention rather than speculating on other states' policies."

2025-12-24 20:46:36,544 - od_agent - INFO - Region new mexico policy response:
 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The decision to target Arizona for inbound screening is driven by a comprehensive risk assessment. Arizona presents the highest inbound flow into New Mexico among all other states, making it a significant potential vector for disease importation. While its infectious density of 0.0047 is not the absolute highest, the sheer volume of travelers from Arizona means that even a moderate density translates to a substantial number of hidden infections. Specifically, with an average daily inflow of 33,023 and an E+I population of 42,872, approximately 170 hidden infections (E+I) are estimated to enter New Mexico daily from Arizona. Implementing a 90percent screening mandate will convert around 153 of these hidden infections directly into the Q compartment upon arrival, significantly reducing the circulating infectious population within New Mexico. This strategy prioritizes the state with the largest absolute contribution of potentially infectious individuals, aiming to maximize the utility of the Q-conversion mechanism. By addressing the primary source of inbound traffic, New Mexico seeks to proactively minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by preventing a large influx of undetected infections from establishing new transmission chains.'

2025-12-24 20:46:58,727 - od_agent - INFO - Region texas policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for travelers originating from mississippi for the next two weeks is based on a comprehensive risk assessment aimed at minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in texas. Mississippi presents the highest source risk profile, with an infectious density (E+I)/Population of approximately 0.0518, which is significantly elevated compared to other origin states and texas's own internal density. This indicates a substantial proportion of its population is currently exposed or actively infected, posing a considerable threat for disease importation. The detection utility of this policy is estimated to be substantial: with an average daily inbound flow of 31,493 individuals from mississippi, applying a ninety percent screening mandate is projected to identify and quarantine approximately 1,467 hidden infections (E and I) daily. Over the 14-day policy duration, this translates to over 20,500 individuals being moved from the Exposed or Infected compartments directly into the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival, effectively preventing these hidden carriers from circulating within texas and initiating new transmission chains. This intervention directly addresses the most potent source of potential disease importation. The choice to target mississippi, rather than other states, reflects a strategy of focusing resources on the most critical and 'obvious' high-risk origin. While other states contribute to inbound traffic, mississippi's unique combination of high infectious density makes it the most impactful target for intervention, maximizing the reduction of imported disease burden for texas."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement Targeted Inbound Screening on mississippi for the next two weeks is based on a comprehensive risk assessment. Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density among all candidate origin states, with (E+I)/Population = (28868+14279)/679133 = 0.0635. This significantly surpasses other states like arizona (0.0048), new mexico (0.0005), and texas (0.0005). Although mississippi's baseline inbound flow to virginia (3517) is not the highest, the high proportion of hidden infections (E and I) within this flow presents a substantial risk of disease importation. By targeting mississippi, we estimate that approximately 0.90 * (28868 + 14279) / 679133 * 3517 = 197 hidden infections (E and I) would be detected and moved into the Q compartment upon arrival in virginia. This proactive detection prevents these individuals from silently spreading the disease within virginia's susceptible population, thereby reducing potential new confirmed cases and deaths. This strategy prioritizes capturing the highest concentration of hidden infections at our border, effectively mitigating the most potent source of disease importation. This is a clear case of targeting the most obvious high-risk state, as the infectious density of mississippi is an order of magnitude higher than any other potential origin."

2025-12-24 20:47:21,726 - od_agent - INFO - Region arizona policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for travelers from mississippi is based on a comprehensive risk assessment. mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density among all potential origin states, with an (E+I)/Population ratio of 0.051416, which is substantially higher than other states like virginia (0.006975), texas (0.000515), and new mexico (0.000502). This elevated density signifies a greater per-traveler risk of disease transmission. Furthermore, despite a moderate average daily inflow of 1731 travelers to arizona, mississippi is projected to contribute the highest number of hidden infections (E and I) daily. With a 90percent screening mandate, approximately 80.18 exposed or infected individuals from mississippi would be converted to confirmed (Q) cases daily upon arrival in arizona. This significantly outweighs the potential captures from virginia (35.26), texas (20.42), or new mexico (12.65). By targeting mississippi, arizona focuses its limited resources on the most impactful source of imported hidden infections, thereby maximizing the utility of the screening policy. This strategic intervention directly addresses the primary external threat, helping to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths within arizona by preventing a substantial number of undetected infections from entering the community and contributing to local transmission.'

2025-12-24 20:47:37,017 - od_agent - INFO - Region mississippi policy response:
 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="For the upcoming two-week horizon, mississippi will implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy on travelers originating from Virginia. This decision is primarily driven by Virginia's high infectious density, calculated at approximately 0.00697 (E+I/Population), which is the highest among all potential origin states. This elevated density indicates a greater prevalence of hidden infections within Virginia's population. Furthermore, despite not having the highest raw inbound flow, the combination of Virginia's infectious density and its average daily inbound flow of 3822 travelers means it contributes the highest estimated number of hidden infections (E and I) entering mississippi daily, approximately 26.65 individuals. The mandated ninety percent screening for Virginia travelers is projected to effectively identify and convert around 24 of these hidden infections into confirmed (Q) cases daily upon arrival, thus significantly mitigating the risk of undetected disease spread within mississippi. This targeted approach focuses on the most impactful source of imported hidden infections, representing a strategic choice to maximize the reduction of disease importation and minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in mississippi, even if other states might also be considering similar high-risk origins."

2025-12-24 20:47:46,445 - od_agent - INFO - Region new mexico policy response:
 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="New Mexico's policy decision targets arizona for inbound screening due to its high infectious density and significant inbound flow. While texas has a larger absolute inbound flow, its infectious density is considerably lower than arizona's. arizona presents the highest 'hidden infection' risk, with an estimated 48,429 E+I individuals. A 90percent screening mandate will convert approximately 43,586 of these hidden infections into confirmed cases upon arrival, significantly reducing the circulating infectious population within new mexico. This strategy focuses on detecting and isolating a substantial portion of the most infectious inbound travelers, minimizing the introduction of new chains of transmission. By selecting arizona, we prioritize a state with a high potential for disease importation relative to its population, aiming to mitigate the immediate risk to new mexico's population. This decision balances the need to reduce imported cases with the constraint of selecting only one origin state, addressing the most potent threat to our local epidemic control efforts. This is a targeted approach, aiming to capture a large number of potentially infectious individuals from the state posing the highest per-capita risk among those with significant inbound traffic."

2025-12-24 20:47:53,184 - od_agent - INFO - Region texas policy response:
 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The primary objective is to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas by strategically intercepting hidden infections. We evaluate the 'Infectious Density' (E+I)/Population for each potential origin state. Arizona presents (50774+3237)/8975210 = 0.0060, Mississippi (27436+12142)/607211 = 0.0651, New Mexico (2883+641)/6970186 = 0.0005, and Virginia (50222+11769)/8345782 = 0.0074. While Mississippi has the highest infectious density, its average daily inbound flow to Texas is only 29,713. New Mexico, despite a very low infectious density, has a significantly higher average daily inbound flow of 146,639. The estimated 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) that would be captured by screening 90percent of the inbound flow are: Arizona: 45081 * 0.0060 * 0.9 = 243, Mississippi: 29713 * 0.0651 * 0.9 = 1740, New Mexico: 146639 * 0.0005 * 0.9 = 66, Virginia: 23716 * 0.0074 * 0.9 = 158. Based on these calculations, targeting Mississippi would yield the highest number of intercepted hidden infections relative to its population, but New Mexico contributes a very large absolute number of travelers daily. Given the current low E+I values in Texas, preventing any significant influx of E and I is critical. Mississippi, with its high infectious density and moderate inbound flow, presents a substantial risk of importing a high concentration of infections. Therefore, to maximize the detection utility and convert the most 'hidden' infections to 'confirmed' status, Mississippi is the optimal choice for a targeted inbound screening. This approach aims to reduce the hidden infectious population entering our community, thereby mitigating future spread."

2025-12-24 20:48:09,243 - od_agent - INFO - Region virginia policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement targeted inbound screening for travelers from mississippi is based on a comprehensive risk assessment focusing on minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in virginia. First, evaluating the Source Risk Profile, mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density (E+I)/Population ratio among all potential origin states, standing at approximately 5.14percent. This is significantly higher than arizona (0.59percent), texas (0.05percent), and new mexico (0.05percent), indicating a greater proportion of hidden infectious individuals within its population. Second, the Detection Utility of screening mississippi travelers is projected to be the most impactful. With a 90percent screening effectiveness, an estimated 162.8 hidden (E+I) infections per day can be identified and moved into virginia's Confirmed (Q) compartment. This is substantially higher than the next highest, arizona, which would yield approximately 27.9 detected infections per day. This proactive conversion prevents these individuals from contributing to undetected community transmission within virginia. Third, regarding Coordination vs. Competition, while texas has the highest average daily inbound flow to virginia, its extremely low infectious density means screening it would yield fewer detected hidden infections compared to mississippi. Therefore, targeting mississippi is a strategic decision to address the most potent source of hidden infection importation, rather than simply the state with the highest traffic volume. This approach maximizes the reduction of potential spreaders entering virginia, aligning directly with the objective of minimizing overall disease burden."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The primary objective is to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in arizona. To achieve this, we evaluate potential origin states based on their 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population) and their average daily inbound flow into arizona. Texas presents the highest risk due to its substantial average daily inbound flow (47229) combined with a significant number of hidden infections (E=6889, I=11149). While mississippi has a higher infectious density (0.054) compared to texas (0.0008), its inbound flow is significantly lower (1989), making its overall contribution to imported hidden infections less impactful than texas. New mexico has a very low infectious density (0.0005) and a moderate inflow (30633), making it a lower priority. Virginia, despite a high infectious density (0.0089), also has a relatively lower inbound flow (5800). Targeting texas allows us to capture approximately 90percent of the (6889 + 11149) * (47229 / 22584974) * 0.9 = 33.7 E/I individuals daily, converting them to Q status upon arrival. This strategy focuses on the largest single source of potential hidden infections based on absolute numbers entering arizona, providing the most substantial reduction in imported disease burden. This decision prioritizes the largest absolute inflow of potentially infectious individuals, rather than solely the highest infectious density, to maximize the utility of the screening intervention in reducing disease spread within arizona."

2025-12-24 20:48:25,705 - od_agent - INFO - Region mississippi policy response:
 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for Virginia is based on a comprehensive risk assessment. Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density among all potential origin states, with an (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.008303. This high density, combined with a significant average daily inbound flow of 4112 travelers into Mississippi, results in the highest estimated daily importation of 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) at approximately 34.14 individuals. By applying a 90percent screening mandate to travelers from Virginia, an estimated 30.73 E and I individuals would be identified and moved into the Confirmed (Q) compartment daily. This action directly addresses the most potent source of undetected disease importation, significantly reducing the influx of individuals who could silently contribute to community transmission within Mississippi. While Texas has a higher overall inbound flow, its much lower infectious density translates to fewer hidden infections imported daily compared to Virginia. Therefore, targeting Virginia offers the greatest utility in mitigating disease spread by converting a substantial number of hidden infections into confirmed cases upon arrival, thereby minimizing future cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi."

2025-12-24 20:48:31,554 - od_agent - INFO - Region new mexico policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to target Mississippi for inbound screening is driven by a comprehensive risk assessment focusing on maximizing the capture of hidden infections while considering overall inflow. Mississippi presents the highest 'Infectious Density' (E+I)/Population among all origin states, indicating a significant per capita risk. Although its total inbound flow into New Mexico is not the largest, its extremely high E+I prevalence means that a targeted screening policy will be highly effective in converting a substantial number of 'hidden' Exposed and Infected individuals to the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival. Specifically, with an (E+I) count of 54,995 and a population of 670,470, Mississippi's infectious density is approximately 8.2percent, far exceeding other states. While Texas has the largest inbound flow, its infectious density is significantly lower (0.06percent), making the per-traveler risk from Mississippi much higher. Implementing a 90percent screening on Mississippi's inbound travelers, despite their lower absolute numbers, is projected to capture a disproportionately high number of previously undetected infectious individuals, thereby preventing further community transmission within New Mexico and minimizing cumulative cases and deaths. This strategy prioritizes the source with the highest inherent risk per traveler, rather than solely focusing on the largest volume, ensuring a targeted and efficient use of screening resources."

2025-12-24 20:48:37,965 - od_agent - INFO - Region texas policy response:
 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement Targeted Inbound Screening on new mexico is based on a strategic assessment of risk and detection utility. While new mexico has the lowest raw 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population) among the candidate states, its significant daily inbound flow into texas (151,282) means it contributes a substantial number of 'hidden' infections. The estimated 14-day cumulative hidden infections from new mexico are 7,833, of which 90percent (7,050) would be immediately converted to Q status upon arrival due to screening. This immediate detection and isolation of a large number of potentially infectious individuals will prevent their uncontrolled spread within texas, thereby mitigating future confirmed cases and deaths. Other states like mississippi have a higher infectious density but a much lower inbound flow, making the absolute number of hidden infections imported significantly less. By targeting new mexico, we aim to capture a large volume of potential importations, effectively reducing the hidden infectious population entering our community and minimizing the overall burden on texas's healthcare system. This approach prioritizes the absolute number of infections prevented from circulating over the relative density of the source population, ensuring a direct and impactful reduction in disease spread."

2025-12-24 20:48:56,649 - od_agent - INFO - Region virginia policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement Targeted Inbound Screening for travelers arriving from mississippi for the next 14-day horizon is driven by a comprehensive assessment of each origin state's epidemic profile and potential impact on Virginia. Firstly, regarding the Source Risk Profile, mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, with an (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.0749. This is significantly higher than arizona (0.0073), texas (0.0008), and new mexico (0.0005), indicating a disproportionately high prevalence of undetected exposed and infected individuals within its population. Secondly, the Detection Utility of this policy is substantial; screening travelers from mississippi is estimated to capture approximately 252 hidden infections (E and I individuals) daily, converting them to confirmed (Q) status upon arrival. This represents the largest number of preventable hidden infections compared to other states, directly reducing the influx of unmonitored carriers into Virginia and mitigating potential community spread. Lastly, concerning Coordination vs. Competition, targeting mississippi is a strategic choice focused on addressing the most pronounced and concentrated source of hidden infection importation. This is not about filling a regional defense gap but directly neutralizing the most impactful source of potential new infections based on its high internal prevalence, thereby prioritizing Virginia's own epidemic control and minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths effectively."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis focuses on identifying the origin state posing the highest risk of disease importation, considering both infectious density and the volume of inbound travelers to arizona. After calculating the total population for each state (S+E+I+Q+R+D), we determined the infectious density (E+I)/Population. Texas has a moderate infectious density of approximately 0.00096, which is lower than mississippi (0.011) and virginia (0.009), but higher than new mexico (0.0007). However, Texas contributes by far the largest average daily inbound flow into arizona at 49,267 travelers. This significant volume means that even with a moderate infectious density, the absolute number of potentially hidden infected individuals (E+I) entering arizona from Texas is substantially higher than from other states. For instance, an estimated 47 hidden infections per day from Texas, compared to 20 from mississippi, 3 from new mexico, and 76 from virginia. While virginia has a higher infectious density and number of hidden infections, its inbound flow is significantly lower (6,174 vs 49,267). By targeting Texas, we aim to capture approximately 90percent of the estimated 47 hidden infections daily, converting them to Q-status. This strategy prioritizes intercepting the largest absolute number of potential imported cases, thereby mitigating the most significant source of systemic risk to arizona's population and minimizing future confirmed cases and deaths. This decision targets the largest inflow source despite not having the highest infectious density, as the sheer volume makes it the most impactful intervention."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement targeted inbound screening for travelers from Texas is based on a comprehensive risk assessment prioritizing the minimization of cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi. While Virginia (0.971percent) and Arizona (0.898percent) exhibit higher infectious densities (E+I)/Population compared to Texas (0.128percent), the critical factor is the absolute number of hidden infections (E+I) likely to enter Mississippi. Texas has a significantly larger average daily inbound flow to Mississippi, with 38,445 travelers, far exceeding Virginia's 4,465 and Arizona's 2,109. This high volume means that even with a lower individual infectious density, Texas contributes the largest absolute number of potential undetected infections. By screening travelers from Texas, an estimated 44.37 hidden infections (E+I) would be captured and converted to Q-status daily (0.9 * 0.0012829 * 38445). This is a greater detection utility than screening Virginia (approximately 39.03 E+I captured daily) or Arizona (approximately 17.05 E+I captured daily). Therefore, targeting Texas ensures the greatest reduction in imported undetected cases, directly addressing the largest source of potential disease importation risk, and is a strategic choice focused on overall impact rather than simply the highest per-capita risk."

 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Our analysis for the next two-week horizon recommends implementing a Targeted Inbound Screening policy on travelers from arizona. This decision is driven by a comprehensive assessment of origin state risk profiles and the potential utility of our screening intervention. While Mississippi exhibits the highest "Infectious Density" at approximately 10.23percent ((E+I)/Population), indicating a significant prevalence of infection within its borders, its average daily inbound flow into New Mexico is comparatively low at 1459 travelers. In contrast, arizona, with an infectious density of approximately 0.90percent, presents a substantial daily inbound flow of 34666 travelers. This high volume of movement, combined with its notable infectious density, results in the highest estimated number of hidden infections (E and I individuals) entering New Mexico. Specifically, implementing a 90percent screening mandate on arizona\'s inbound travelers is projected to detect and convert approximately 3925 hidden cases to confirmed status over the next 14 days, significantly more than any other origin state. This strategy prioritizes capturing the largest absolute number of potential community transmissions, effectively reducing the hidden infectious population entering New Mexico. This is a direct, data-driven approach to mitigate the most impactful source of imported cases, rather than focusing on states with high internal prevalence but low cross-border transmission risk to New Mexico. By targeting arizona, we maximize the reduction in potential new confirmed cases and deaths within our state, optimizing our limited screening resources to address the most significant systemic risk.'

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis focuses on minimizing the influx of 'hidden infections' (Exposed and Infected individuals) into Texas. We first calculated the infectious density for each potential origin state. New Mexico presented the highest infectious density at 0.000717, indicating a higher proportion of infectious individuals within its population. While Arizona and Virginia have higher total E+I counts, their larger populations dilute this risk. Mississippi, despite a lower total E+I, has a significantly higher infectious density than Arizona or Virginia, but still less than New Mexico. The next step was to estimate the number of hidden infections that would be captured by a 90percent screening mandate. New Mexico, with its high infectious density and a significant baseline inbound flow of 146,052 travelers, yields the highest number of potential hidden infections captured, at approximately 94. This targeted intervention on New Mexico is projected to be the most effective in preventing the spread of undetected disease within Texas. By converting these E and I individuals to Q status upon arrival, we significantly reduce the hidden infectious population entering our community, thereby mitigating the risk of new outbreaks and minimizing future confirmed cases and deaths in Texas."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis focuses on identifying the origin state posing the highest risk of undetected infections entering Virginia. We evaluated each state's infectious density, defined as (E+I)/Population, and the potential number of hidden infections that would be captured by our 90percent screening policy, considering their baseline inbound flow. Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density among the origin states at approximately 0.147, significantly higher than Arizona (0.017), New Mexico (0.0007), and Texas (0.0012). While Mississippi's raw inbound flow is not the largest, its extremely high infectious density means that a significant number of 'hidden' E and I cases would be imported relative to its population size if unchecked. By targeting Mississippi, we estimate that approximately 66,324 'hidden' infections (E+I) would be identified and moved to the Q compartment over the 14-day period (0.9 * (53736+19986) * (3551/6606055) * 14). This intervention prioritizes addressing the most concentrated source of potential undetected spread, directly mitigating a high-risk importation pathway and minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia. This strategy aims to capture a substantial number of infections that would otherwise contribute to community spread, thereby filling a critical gap in regional defense against high-density infectious populations."

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement targeted inbound screening on New Mexico is based on a multi-faceted risk assessment. While Texas exhibits the highest absolute number of infected individuals, New Mexico presents the highest 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population) among all potential origin states, indicating a more pervasive and less controlled spread within its population. This higher density suggests a greater likelihood of hidden, infectious individuals per capita traveling from New Mexico. Furthermore, New Mexico has a substantial average daily inbound flow into Arizona (37,298), making it a significant vector for disease importation. By screening travelers from New Mexico, we estimate capturing approximately 325 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) per day (90percent of (6363+1462) * (37298 / Total New Mexico population)), which would be immediately moved to the Confirmed (Q) compartment. This proactive detection prevents these individuals from silently spreading the disease within Arizona's susceptible population, thereby significantly reducing future confirmed cases and deaths. While Texas also has a high inbound flow and a large absolute number of E+I, its lower infectious density suggests that a smaller proportion of its travelers would be carrying hidden infections relative to its total population, making New Mexico the more impactful target for this specific intervention, focusing on the efficiency of detection per traveler. This strategy aims to address a critical, high-density source of potential spread without necessarily competing with other states that might target the largest absolute numbers."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The primary objective is to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths within mississippi by intercepting imported infections. We evaluated each potential origin state by two key metrics: its "Infectious Density" ((E+I)/Population) and the absolute number of "Hidden Infections" (E and I) expected to arrive in mississippi, considering inbound flow. Arizona (0.01125) and Virginia (0.01112) exhibit the highest infectious densities among the potential origin states, indicating a higher per-capita risk. New Mexico (0.000872) and Texas (0.001761) have comparatively lower densities. However, when considering the average daily inbound flow into mississippi, Texas presents the most significant source of imported hidden infections, with an estimated 63.35 E+I travelers per day. This is substantially higher than Virginia (47.23 E+I/day), Arizona (23.46 E+I/day), and New Mexico (1.01 E+I/day). Implementing a ninety percent screening mandate on travelers from Texas is projected to convert approximately 57.02 E and I individuals to Q status daily, significantly more than any other state. This strategy prioritizes intercepting the largest absolute volume of hidden infections rather than solely focusing on the highest per-capita risk, ensuring the maximum immediate impact on reducing disease spread within mississippi. While other states might target the highest density origins, our approach is to address the source contributing the most actual infectious individuals to our state.'

 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement targeted inbound screening for travelers from Arizona is based on a comprehensive risk assessment prioritizing the minimization of cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico. Arizona presents a significant source risk due to its substantial daily inbound flow into New Mexico, averaging 31,372 travelers. While its infectious density of approximately 0.01125 (E+I per capita) is not the highest among all potential origin states (Mississippi, for example, has a higher density of 0.1287), Arizona's high travel volume means it contributes the largest absolute number of hidden infections. The detection utility of this policy is estimated to capture approximately 317.61 hidden infections (Exposed and Infected individuals) daily, directly converting them into the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival. This is the highest potential capture rate compared to other states; for instance, screening Mississippi would capture about 131.67 infections, and Texas about 126.72, despite their varying infectious densities and mobility patterns. This strategy demonstrates a focus on maximizing the number of actual infections detected and contained, rather than solely targeting the highest per-capita infection rate. This approach is not necessarily about competition but about optimizing resource allocation to address the most impactful source of disease importation for New Mexico, effectively reducing the hidden infectious population and mitigating the risk of community transmission."

2025-12-24 20:50:53,371 - od_agent - INFO - Region texas policy response:
 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="After careful evaluation of potential origin states, the policy recommends implementing a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for travelers arriving from arizona. The primary consideration for this decision is arizona's significantly high infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population. With an (E+I) count of 104535 and a population of 9363060, arizona presents the highest risk of disease importation into texas. Furthermore, arizona contributes a substantial average daily inbound flow of 45426 travelers to texas. The screening mandate, converting 90percent of exposed and infected individuals to confirmed (Q) status upon arrival, is estimated to capture a significant number of hidden infections. Specifically, from arizona's daily inbound flow, approximately 45426 * (104535 / 9363060) = 507.7 (E+I) individuals are expected to enter texas daily. With a 90percent screening effectiveness, this policy could prevent around 457 'hidden' infected or exposed individuals from circulating within texas daily, thereby reducing community transmission risks. While other states like mississippi also show a high infectious density, their inbound flow to texas is considerably lower, making the impact of screening less pronounced. Targeting arizona addresses the largest flow of high-risk individuals, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in texas by proactively identifying and isolating potential vectors."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The decision to implement Targeted Inbound Screening on mississippi for the next two weeks is based on a comprehensive risk assessment. mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density among all potential origin states, with a combined (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 19.4percent ((67736+26111)/462620). This significantly surpasses other states like arizona (1.1percent), new mexico (0.09percent), and texas (0.18percent). While the average daily inbound flow from mississippi (3545) is not the highest, the extremely high prevalence of hidden infections (E and I) within its population presents a substantial risk of disease importation. By targeting mississippi, we estimate that approximately 8443 (90percent of (67736+26111) * (3545/462620)) hidden infections will be detected and converted to Q-status upon arrival in virginia over the 14-day period. This proactive screening will effectively reduce the number of infectious individuals circulating undetected within virginia, thereby mitigating the risk of new transmission chains and contributing to the minimization of cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. This strategy represents a targeted intervention against the most potent source of hidden infection, even if other states contribute larger raw numbers of total travelers, prioritizing the reduction of undetected community spread.'

2025-12-24 20:51:02,803 - od_agent - INFO - Region arizona policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis focuses on minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in arizona by strategically targeting inbound traffic. We first calculated the 'Infectious Density' (E+I)/Population for each potential origin state. Mississippi presented the highest infectious density at approximately 15.65percent, significantly greater than new mexico (0.10percent), texas (0.23percent), and virginia (1.30percent). While mississippi's baseline inbound flow to arizona is the lowest at 1900, the high infectious density translates to a substantial number of 'hidden infections' (E+I) per traveler. Specifically, with 90percent screening, we estimate converting approximately 224 (0.9 * (82835+33357)/425333 * 1900) hidden infections from mississippi into the Q compartment upon arrival over the 14-day period. This 'Detection Utility' is crucial as it prevents these individuals from silently spreading the disease within arizona. Although other states like texas and new mexico have higher absolute inbound flows, their lower infectious densities mean that screening them would yield fewer converted hidden infections relative to their population size and overall risk profile. Furthermore, by targeting mississippi, we are addressing a high-risk source that might be overlooked by other states focusing on larger mobility corridors, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive regional defense strategy. This intervention aims to significantly reduce the hidden infectious population entering arizona, thereby mitigating future disease spread and its associated health and economic burdens."

2025-12-24 20:51:07,864 - od_agent - INFO - Region mississippi policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement Targeted Inbound Screening for travelers from Texas is based on a comprehensive risk assessment. Texas presents the highest 'Infectious Density' among all potential origin states, with a significant (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.0023. This indicates a relatively higher proportion of hidden infections within its population. More critically, Texas contributes the largest average daily inbound flow into Mississippi, estimated at 35,622 individuals. This substantial flow, combined with its high infectious density, makes it the primary source of potential disease importation. By targeting Texas, the screening policy is estimated to capture and convert approximately 159 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) into 'Confirmed (Q)' status daily. This intervention aims to proactively identify and isolate infected individuals upon arrival, thereby preventing their unmonitored integration into the Mississippi community and significantly reducing the risk of local transmission. While other states like Virginia and Arizona have notable infectious densities, their inbound flows are considerably lower, leading to fewer projected 'Hidden Infections' intercepted. This focused approach on Texas is a strategic choice to mitigate the most significant external epidemiological threat to Mississippi, aligning with the objective of minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths."

2025-12-24 20:51:13,016 - od_agent - INFO - Region new mexico policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico, we recommend implementing a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for travelers originating from Texas. While Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, its inbound flow to New Mexico is significantly lower than Texas. Texas, despite having a lower infectious density than Mississippi, contributes the largest number of inbound travelers to New Mexico by a substantial margin. The estimated hidden infections (E+I) from Texas, at 46,055, are considerably higher than those from Arizona (14,463), Mississippi (10,500), or Virginia (4,400) when considering the actual daily inbound flow. By targeting Texas, approximately 41,449 hidden infections (90percent of 46,055) will be converted to the Q compartment, significantly reducing the influx of undetected infectious individuals into New Mexico. This strategy focuses on the largest source of potential importation risk, leveraging the screening's detection utility where it can have the greatest impact on New Mexico's epidemic trajectory. This approach prioritizes reducing the overall volume of hidden infections entering the state, rather than solely focusing on the highest per-capita risk, which aligns with minimizing cumulative cases and deaths."

2025-12-24 20:51:19,636 - od_agent - INFO - Region texas policy response:
 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement Targeted Inbound Screening on travelers from arizona is driven by a comprehensive assessment of source risk, detection utility, and strategic coordination. Arizona presents the highest Infectious Density among the candidate states, with an (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 1.51percent, significantly higher than mississippi's 1.48percent, virginia's 1.41percent, and new mexico's 0.10percent. This indicates a greater likelihood of infectious individuals traveling from arizona into texas. Furthermore, arizona has the highest average daily inbound flow into texas at 42,590 travelers. By applying a 90percent screening mandate to arizona, we estimate capturing approximately 5,745 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) per day over the 14-day period (0.9 * (120863 E + 7770 I) / 8490723 Pop * 42590 Inflow). This substantial conversion of E and I to Q upon arrival will significantly reduce the hidden infectious load entering texas, thereby mitigating potential community spread and minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. While mississippi also has a high infectious density, its inbound flow to texas is considerably lower (28,405), making the impact of screening less pronounced. Targeting arizona addresses the most significant source of potential importation risk, aligning with a strategy to tackle the largest and most infectious inbound pathway first, even if it might be an 'obvious' high-risk choice, as its impact on texas's epidemiological trajectory is projected to be the most beneficial."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement Targeted Inbound Screening on Texas for the next two weeks is based on a comprehensive risk assessment. Texas presents the highest inbound flow into Virginia, contributing significantly to potential disease importation. While Mississippi has a higher infectious density, the sheer volume of travelers from Texas means that even with a slightly lower density, the absolute number of hidden infections entering Virginia is substantially greater. The estimated detection utility is therefore maximized by targeting Texas, as converting a large number of 'E' and 'I' cases from this major source into 'Q' status will have the most impactful reduction on Virginia's cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. This strategy prioritizes mitigating the largest incoming vector of disease, ensuring that our efforts are concentrated where they will yield the most significant public health benefit. This approach balances the need to address high-risk sources with the practicalities of managing high-volume traffic, and by focusing on Texas, we are targeting the most impactful source of potential new infections without necessarily competing with other states for the 'obvious' highest density, but rather addressing the highest absolute risk."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for mississippi for the next two weeks is based on a comprehensive analysis of source risk profiles, inbound traffic volumes, and the potential utility of screening. mississippi exhibits the highest 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population) among all candidate origin states, at approximately 0.15019. While its average daily inbound flow into arizona (2184) is not the highest in absolute terms, this exceptionally high infectious density translates into the largest estimated number of 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) entering arizona daily from any single origin state (approximately 328 individuals). The proposed 90percent screening mandate for travelers from mississippi is projected to convert approximately 295 of these hidden infections into confirmed (Q) cases upon arrival, effectively isolating them and preventing further community transmission within arizona. This intervention directly addresses the most potent source of disease importation risk, prioritizing the reduction of potential new infections and subsequent burden on arizona's healthcare system. This approach focuses on the most 'obvious' high-risk source, as its high infectious density makes it a disproportionately significant contributor to imported hidden cases, thereby maximizing the impact of the screening policy on minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in arizona."

2025-12-24 20:51:46,726 - od_agent - INFO - Region mississippi policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement targeted inbound screening on Texas is based on a comprehensive risk assessment. First, considering the 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population) for all potential origin states: Arizona's density is approximately 0.0019, New Mexico's is about 0.000013, Texas's is around 0.000030, and Virginia's is approximately 0.0016. While Arizona and Virginia show higher relative densities, Texas presents a unique challenge due to its significantly higher average daily inbound flow into Mississippi (47,560 compared to Arizona's 1891, New Mexico's 1937, and Virginia's 4629). This high volume means that even with a lower relative infectious density, the absolute number of potentially infected individuals arriving from Texas is substantially higher. The 'Detection Utility' of screening Texas travelers is estimated to capture a large number of 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) that would otherwise enter Mississippi undetected. With a 90percent screening mandate, we project to convert a significant portion of these hidden cases to Q-status upon arrival, thereby reducing the seeding of new infections within Mississippi. In terms of 'Coordination vs. Competition,' this strategy focuses on the highest volume contributor to potential importations. By targeting Texas, Mississippi addresses its most significant external vector of disease, aiming to mitigate the largest single source of imported cases. This approach prioritizes minimizing overall case importation by focusing on the largest flow, rather than solely on the highest prevalence state, which might have lower overall impact due to limited travel volumes."

 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our policy for the next two weeks will implement targeted inbound screening for travelers arriving from Arizona. This decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of source risk profiles and the potential utility of detection. We first assessed the 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population) for all potential origin states. Mississippi exhibited the highest infectious density (0.150), indicating a substantial proportion of its population is exposed or infected. Arizona and Virginia presented moderate densities (0.017 and 0.013 respectively), while Texas had a comparatively low density (0.002). Next, we considered the 'Detection Utility' by estimating how many 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) would be captured and converted to Q-status via a 90percent screening mandate for each state's inbound flow to New Mexico. Despite Mississippi's high infectious density, its low daily inbound flow to New Mexico (1008 travelers) meant that screening would capture approximately 136 hidden infections. Texas, while having the highest inbound flow (79862 travelers), had a very low infectious density, leading to an estimated 205 captured hidden infections. Arizona, however, with a significant daily inbound flow (27828 travelers) and a moderate infectious density, offered the highest potential for intervention, with an estimated 442 hidden infections captured through screening. Therefore, by targeting Arizona, we maximize the conversion of undetected infectious individuals into confirmed cases upon arrival, directly mitigating the risk of community transmission within New Mexico. This strategy prioritizes the state contributing the largest absolute number of hidden infections, ensuring the most effective reduction in imported disease burden for New Mexico, rather than solely focusing on the highest density or highest volume state in isolation."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for mississippi is driven by a comprehensive risk assessment. mississippi presents the highest 'Infectious Density' with an (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.1502, significantly exceeding that of other potential origin states like arizona (0.0177), virginia (0.0138), and new mexico (0.0013). This high density indicates a substantially elevated probability that any given traveler from mississippi is currently exposed or infected. Furthermore, considering the average daily inbound flow from mississippi into texas (38,606 individuals), this high infectious density translates to an estimated 5,798 hidden infections (E+I) entering texas daily from this single source. The proposed policy's 'Detection Utility' is estimated to capture and convert approximately 5,218 of these hidden infections into confirmed cases (Q-status) each day (90percent of 5,798). This substantial daily conversion will significantly reduce the number of undetected infectious individuals circulating within texas, thereby minimizing potential onward transmission and ultimately mitigating cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. While other states may have higher overall inbound flow (e.g., new mexico), their lower infectious densities result in fewer estimated hidden infections, making mississippi the most impactful target for this intervention. This strategy prioritizes addressing the most concentrated and potent source of disease importation to maximize public health benefit for texas."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis focuses on identifying the origin state posing the highest risk of undetected infections entering Virginia. We first calculated the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each potential origin state. Texas showed the highest infectious density at approximately 0.0030, followed by mississippi at 0.0028, arizona at 0.0019, and new mexico at 0.0001. More critically, we estimated the total number of 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) that would enter Virginia daily from each state based on their average daily inbound flow. Texas stands out significantly with an estimated 173 'Hidden Infections' per day, far exceeding mississippi (116), arizona (9), and new mexico (2). By implementing a Targeted Inbound Screening policy on Texas, we anticipate capturing and converting 90percent of these 173 'Hidden Infections' to Q-status, effectively preventing approximately 156 undetected infected or exposed individuals from circulating within Virginia daily. This strategy targets the most substantial source of potential disease importation, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by significantly reducing the hidden infectious population entering our community. This decision prioritizes the most impactful intervention given the constraint of selecting only one origin state, addressing the largest single source of potential spread into Virginia."
