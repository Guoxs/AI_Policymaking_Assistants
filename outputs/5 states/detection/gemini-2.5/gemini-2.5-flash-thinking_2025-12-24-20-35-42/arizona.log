While Mississippi has the highest infectious density, New Mexico presents a unique risk profile due to its significantly higher average daily inbound flow into Arizona (18,891 travelers) compared to other states. Despite a lower individual infectious density than Mississippi, the sheer volume of travelers from New Mexico means that a substantial number of hidden infections (E+I) are likely to enter Arizona daily. Specifically, New Mexico's (E+I) population is 841, and with an average flow of 18,891, approximately 6.6 hidden infectious individuals (841 / 2,396,032 * 18,891) could enter daily. Implementing a 90% screening on these individuals would convert an estimated 6 individuals per day to Q status, preventing them from spreading the disease undetected within Arizona. This strategy prioritizes the capture of a larger absolute number of hidden infections from a high-volume source, even if its individual infectious density is not the highest, thereby offering a more impactful reduction in potential disease spread for Arizona.

While Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density with an (E+I)/Pop ratio of approximately 0.0046, its average daily inbound flow into Arizona is relatively low at 2382. New Mexico has a low infectious density and a moderate inflow. Texas, on the other hand, presents a significant risk due to its substantial average daily inbound flow of 48951 travelers, which is by far the highest among all potential origin states. Although its infectious density is lower than Mississippi's at approximately 0.00019, the sheer volume of travelers means that a higher absolute number of hidden infections (E+I) are likely to be imported from Texas. Implementing a 90% screening mandate on this high-volume corridor is projected to capture a considerable number of otherwise undetected exposed and infected individuals, converting them to confirmed (Q) cases upon arrival. This proactive detection strategy minimizes the spread within Arizona by immediately isolating infected individuals who would otherwise contribute to community transmission.

  "global_guidance": "The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for travelers arriving from mississippi for the next two weeks is based on a comprehensive risk assessment focusing on minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths within arizona. Firstly, the Source Risk Profile was evaluated by calculating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for all potential origin states. Mississippi exhibited a significantly higher infectious density of approximately 0.0187, compared to virginia (0.0019), new mexico (0.00024), and texas (0.00022). This indicates that a substantially larger proportion of mississippi's population is currently exposed or actively infected. Secondly, we assessed the Detection Utility, estimating the number of 'Hidden Infections' (E and I individuals) that would be captured and converted to Q-status through the rigorous ninety percent screening. Despite mississippi not having the highest overall daily inbound flow to arizona, its high infectious density results in the highest estimated daily inflow of hidden infections, at approximately 48.5 individuals. Implementing the screening would lead to the immediate isolation of about 43.7 such individuals daily, significantly reducing the hidden infectious population entering arizona. This cumulative conversion of over 610 hidden infections over the 14-day period is substantially greater than the potential conversions from other states (e.g., texas ~10, virginia ~9.8, new mexico ~6.6 daily). This strategy directly addresses the primary source of high-risk importation. As there is no information on other agents' policies, targeting mississippi is the most direct and impactful approach to protect arizona by isolating the most significant source of incoming hidden infections, which aligns with the objective of minimizing disease spread."

Mississippi presents the highest infectious density at 5.25%, followed by Virginia at 0.49%, New Mexico at 0.04%, and Texas at 0.05%. While Mississippi has the highest infectious density, its average daily inbound flow into Arizona is relatively low at 1831 travelers. New Mexico, despite having a lower infectious density (0.04%), has a significantly higher average daily inbound flow of 26310 travelers. The estimated number of hidden infections (E+I) from New Mexico, if 90% were screened and converted, would be approximately 10.74 (0.04% of 26310), which is a substantial reduction for a high-volume corridor. Texas also has a high inbound flow (45155) but a slightly higher infectious density (0.05%), leading to an estimated 24.16 hidden infections. However, New Mexico's overall population is smaller, and its proportion of (E+I) within its total population is lower compared to Mississippi, making the impact of screening its higher flow more targeted and efficient for Arizona. By targeting New Mexico, we are not necessarily picking the state with the highest *proportion* of infection, but rather the state that presents a significant *absolute number* of hidden infections due to its high inbound volume, which can be effectively mitigated by the 90% screening. This strategy aims to capture a considerable number of hidden cases from a major entry point, thereby reducing the seeding of new infections in Arizona while balancing the impact of intervention with the volume of incoming traffic."

This significantly elevated prevalence indicates a higher likelihood of infected or exposed individuals traveling from this region.

  "global_guidance": "The decision to implement targeted inbound screening on New Mexico is based on a multi-faceted risk assessment. While Texas exhibits the highest absolute number of infected individuals, New Mexico presents the highest 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population) among all potential origin states, indicating a more pervasive and less controlled spread within its population. This higher density suggests a greater likelihood of hidden, infectious individuals per capita traveling from New Mexico. Furthermore, New Mexico has a substantial average daily inbound flow into Arizona (37,298), making it a significant vector for disease importation. By screening travelers from New Mexico, we estimate capturing approximately 325 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) per day (90% of (6363+1462) * (37298 / Total New Mexico population)), which would be immediately moved to the Confirmed (Q) compartment. This proactive detection prevents these individuals from silently spreading the disease within Arizona's susceptible population, thereby significantly reducing future confirmed cases and deaths. While Texas also has a high inbound flow and a large absolute number of E+I, its lower infectious density suggests that a smaller proportion of its travelers would be carrying hidden infections relative to its total population, making New Mexico the more impactful target for this specific intervention, focusing on the efficiency of detection per traveler. This strategy aims to address a critical, high-density source of potential spread without necessarily competing with other states that might target the largest absolute numbers."

  "global_guidance": "Our analysis focuses on minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in arizona by strategically targeting inbound traffic. We first calculated the 'Infectious Density' (E+I)/Population for each potential origin state. Mississippi presented the highest infectious density at approximately 15.65%, significantly greater than new mexico (0.10%), texas (0.23%), and virginia (1.30%). While mississippi's baseline inbound flow to arizona is the lowest at 1900, the high infectious density translates to a substantial number of 'hidden infections' (E+I) per traveler. Specifically, with 90% screening, we estimate converting approximately 224 (0.9 * (82835+33357)/425333 * 1900) hidden infections from mississippi into the Q compartment upon arrival over the 14-day period. This 'Detection Utility' is crucial as it prevents these individuals from silently spreading the disease within arizona. Although other states like texas and new mexico have higher absolute inbound flows, their lower infectious densities mean that screening them would yield fewer converted hidden infections relative to their population size and overall risk profile. Furthermore, by targeting mississippi, we are addressing a high-risk source that might be overlooked by other states focusing on larger mobility corridors, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive regional defense strategy. This intervention aims to significantly reduce the hidden infectious population entering arizona, thereby mitigating future disease spread and its associated health and economic burdens."

The proposed 90% screening mandate for travelers from mississippi is projected to convert approximately 295 of these hidden infections into confirmed (Q) cases upon arrival, effectively isolating them and preventing further community transmission within arizona. This intervention directly addresses the most potent source of disease importation risk, prioritizing the reduction of potential new infections and subsequent burden on arizona's healthcare system.
