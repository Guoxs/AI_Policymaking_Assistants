Arizona presents the highest infectious density among all candidate states, with a significant (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.00040. This indicates a higher probability of infected or exposed individuals entering New Mexico from Arizona compared to other states. Furthermore, Arizona contributes the largest number of hidden infections (E+I) into New Mexico daily, with an estimated 19.1 individuals, which is substantially higher than Texas (0.9), Mississippi (0.9), and Virginia (0.5).

Screening Texas would therefore capture an estimated 4.25 hidden infections (E+I) daily (0.000068 * 69252 * 0.9), preventing them from spreading within New Mexico, whereas screening Arizona would only capture about 9.1 hidden infections (0.000393 * 25816 * 0.9).

By implementing a 90percent screening mandate, we estimate capturing a significant number of 'hidden infections' (E and I) from Arizona, converting them to the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival. This strategy aims to prevent these individuals from silently spreading the disease within New Mexico's susceptible population, thereby directly minimizing future confirmed cases and deaths. While other states like Mississippi have high infectious density, their inbound flow to New Mexico is significantly lower, making Arizona the primary source of imported risk to address. This targeted approach focuses resources on the most impactful origin, aligning with a strategy of mitigating the most significant external threat to New Mexico's public health."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico, we recommend implementing a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for travelers originating from Texas. While Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, its inbound flow to New Mexico is significantly lower than Texas. Texas, despite having a lower infectious density than Mississippi, contributes the largest number of inbound travelers to New Mexico by a substantial margin. The estimated hidden infections (E+I) from Texas, at 46,055, are considerably higher than those from Arizona (14,463), Mississippi (10,500), or Virginia (4,400) when considering the actual daily inbound flow. By targeting Texas, approximately 41,449 hidden infections (90% of 46,055) will be converted to the Q compartment, significantly reducing the influx of undetected infectious individuals into New Mexico. This strategy focuses on the largest source of potential importation risk, leveraging the screening's detection utility where it can have the greatest impact on New Mexico's epidemic trajectory. This approach prioritizes reducing the overall volume of hidden infections entering the state, rather than solely focusing on the highest per-capita risk, which aligns with minimizing cumulative cases and deaths."

  "global_guidance": "Our policy for the next two weeks will implement targeted inbound screening for travelers arriving from Arizona. This decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of source risk profiles and the potential utility of detection. We first assessed the 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population) for all potential origin states. Mississippi exhibited the highest infectious density (0.150), indicating a substantial proportion of its population is exposed or infected. Arizona and Virginia presented moderate densities (0.017 and 0.013 respectively), while Texas had a comparatively low density (0.002). Next, we considered the 'Detection Utility' by estimating how many 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) would be captured and converted to Q-status via a 90% screening mandate for each state's inbound flow to New Mexico. Despite Mississippi's high infectious density, its low daily inbound flow to New Mexico (1008 travelers) meant that screening would capture approximately 136 hidden infections. Texas, while having the highest inbound flow (79862 travelers), had a very low infectious density, leading to an estimated 205 captured hidden infections. Arizona, however, with a significant daily inbound flow (27828 travelers) and a moderate infectious density, offered the highest potential for intervention, with an estimated 442 hidden infections captured through screening. Therefore, by targeting Arizona, we maximize the conversion of undetected infectious individuals into confirmed cases upon arrival, directly mitigating the risk of community transmission within New Mexico. This strategy prioritizes the state contributing the largest absolute number of hidden infections, ensuring the most effective reduction in imported disease burden for New Mexico, rather than solely focusing on the highest density or highest volume state in isolation."
