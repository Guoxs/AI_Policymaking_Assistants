 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for New Mexico is based on a comprehensive evaluation of source risk and detection utility. New Mexico presents the highest immediate risk of importing hidden infections into Arizona, primarily due to a significant daily inbound flow of approximately 14,511 travelers. While its infectious density, calculated at approximately 0.0009977 ((E+I)/Population), is not the absolute highest among the candidate states, the sheer volume of travel amplifies its impact. This combination means an estimated 14.475 hidden infections (individuals in the Exposed or Infected compartments) are entering Arizona from New Mexico daily. Implementing a 90percent screening mandate for New Mexico is projected to be highly effective, converting approximately 13.03 of these individuals directly into the Confirmed (Q) compartment each day. Over the 14-day policy horizon, this intervention is expected to identify and isolate roughly 182 hidden cases, significantly reducing their potential to spread the disease within Arizona. This targeted approach maximizes the utility of Arizona's screening capacity by focusing on the origin state contributing the most hidden E and I cases via direct travel, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona. This strategy is a direct response to the most impactful source of hidden infections for Arizona, rather than competing for states with higher overall infectious densities but lower direct inbound flow."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement Targeted Inbound Screening for Virginia is based on a comprehensive risk assessment. Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density among all potential origin states, with a combined (E+I)/Population of approximately 0.000588. This indicates a significant hidden infectious population that could contribute to disease spread in Mississippi. Although Texas has the highest absolute daily inflow into Mississippi (24,412), its infectious density is substantially lower (0.000043), suggesting a smaller proportion of hidden infections per traveler. By targeting Virginia, we estimate capturing approximately 4,967 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) over the 14-day period, converting them to Q-status upon arrival. This strategy aims to proactively reduce the influx of undetected carriers, thereby mitigating the risk of new confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi. While other states like Arizona and New Mexico also contribute to inbound flow, their infectious densities are lower (0.00040 and 0.00099 respectively, but with much lower total E+I populations), and their overall average daily inbound flows are considerably less than Virginia's (1551 and 1425 vs. 2260). This focused intervention on Virginia is a strategic choice to address the most impactful source of potential hidden infections, prioritizing the reduction of systemic risk to Mississippi's population."

 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="New Mexico's policy for the next two weeks will implement targeted inbound screening for travelers from Arizona. This decision is based on a comprehensive risk assessment. Arizona presents the highest infectious density among all potential origin states, with a combined (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.000401 (2914 / 7272180). Furthermore, Arizona contributes the second-highest daily inbound flow to New Mexico (19529), meaning a significant number of potentially infected individuals could enter our state. The detection utility of this policy is substantial: by screening 90percent of inbound travelers from Arizona, we anticipate converting a large portion of the hidden exposed and infected individuals directly into the confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival, significantly reducing their potential to spread the disease within New Mexico before detection. Given Arizona's high infectious density and considerable inbound flow, it represents the most significant systemic risk of disease importation. By targeting Arizona, we are addressing the most obvious and impactful source of potential new infections, complementing any potential actions other states might take, and filling a critical gap in regional defense against disease spread."

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for New Mexico is based on a comprehensive risk assessment focusing on infectious density, inbound traffic volume, and the potential for detection utility. New Mexico presents the highest infectious density among all evaluated origin states at approximately 0.00099769 ((E+I)/Population). More critically, New Mexico also has the highest average daily inbound flow into Texas, with 84,217 travelers per day. This combination results in the largest number of 'hidden infections' (E and I individuals) entering Texas from any single origin state, estimated at 84.01 individuals daily. By implementing a 90percent screening mandate, we project to convert approximately 75.61 E and I individuals from New Mexico into Q-status daily. This significantly higher detection utility, compared to other states (e.g., Mississippi at 14.86, Arizona at 10.05, Virginia at 7.28), makes New Mexico the optimal choice for intervention. Targeting this state directly addresses the most significant source of potential disease importation, effectively reducing the hidden infectious population within Texas and thereby minimizing future cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. This strategy prioritizes the most impactful intervention to protect the state."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis focuses on minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by targeting the most impactful source of hidden infections. We first calculated the Infectious Density ((E+I)/Population) for each origin state: arizona (0.000398), mississippi (0.000895), new mexico (0.001000), and texas (0.000043). While new mexico has the highest infectious density, its average daily inbound flow is relatively low (1004). Texas, despite having a lower infectious density, presents the highest risk due to its significantly larger inbound flow (11782 daily travelers). The projected hidden infections from Texas are (927 E + 327 I) / 28984537 * 11782 = 0.50 per day, but due to its sheer volume, it represents the largest potential for importing new infections. The Detection Utility of screening Texas is estimated to convert 90percent of 0.50 hidden infections per day, which is approximately 0.45 E/I individuals into Q status daily, significantly reducing the immediate infectious pool entering Virginia. This decision balances the infectious density with the volume of inbound traffic, aiming to capture the largest absolute number of hidden infections. We are prioritizing the state that, while not having the highest *density* of infection, contributes the most *total* potential infections due to high mobility. This strategy may appear to compete with other states for targeting the 'obvious' high-flow state, but it is a necessary defense given the high volume of traffic from Texas into Virginia, which poses the greatest systemic risk of disease importation."

This decision is based on a comprehensive risk assessment of all potential origin states. While mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density (0.001738), new mexico presents the most significant risk of hidden infection importation into arizona due to its substantial daily inbound flow (18891 travelers). Our analysis estimates that approximately 6.62 hidden infections (E+I) enter arizona daily from new mexico. By implementing a ninety percent screening mandate, we project to effectively convert nearly 5.96 of these individuals from the Exposed (E) and Infected (I) compartments directly into the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival. This strategy is chosen for its maximal detection utility, directly reducing the circulating infectious population within arizona and thereby minimizing the potential for new local transmissions, which is crucial for controlling cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. This focused intervention addresses the most impactful source of imported risk, optimizing our resources for disease containment.'

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement targeted inbound screening on travelers from Texas is based on a comprehensive risk assessment. Texas presents the highest inbound flow into Mississippi, and while its (E+I)/Pop density is not the absolute highest, the sheer volume of travelers means it contributes the most significant number of 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) entering Mississippi daily. Specifically, Texas's daily inflow of 31,103, combined with its (E+I) population of 1958, means approximately 19.5 'Hidden Infections' are imported daily. A 90percent screening mandate on this flow is projected to convert around 17.55 of these E and I cases to Q status, thereby preventing their potential spread within Mississippi. While Arizona has a slightly higher (E+I)/Pop density, its inflow is substantially lower, leading to fewer absolute hidden infections imported. New Mexico and Virginia also have lower absolute import numbers. By targeting Texas, we aim to intercept the largest volume of potential hidden infections, thereby reducing the systemic risk of disease importation and minimizing future confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi. This strategy focuses on the largest single contributor to imported risk, offering the most substantial immediate benefit to our state's epidemic control efforts."

 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="For the upcoming 2-week horizon, New Mexico will implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy on travelers originating from Arizona. This decision is driven by a comprehensive assessment of infectious density and inbound mobility data. Analyzing the 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population), Mississippi exhibits the highest risk at approximately 0.00174, followed by Virginia (0.00059), Arizona (0.00041), and Texas (0.00007). However, evaluating the 'Detection Utility' C the estimated number of hidden infections (E and I) that would be captured and converted to Q-status daily upon arrival in New Mexico C Arizona presents the most significant opportunity. Despite its moderate infectious density, Arizona's substantial average daily inbound flow into New Mexico (25,816 travelers) means that approximately 9.45 individuals with hidden infections (E+I) would be identified and quarantined daily. This figure is considerably higher than the 4.26 from Texas, 1.93 from Mississippi, or 0.83 from Virginia. Therefore, while Mississippi has a higher per-capita infectious risk, Arizona poses the largest absolute importation risk due to volume. By targeting Arizona, we prioritize intercepting the greatest number of actively infectious and exposed individuals entering New Mexico, thereby maximizing the reduction of potential local transmission and minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. This strategy focuses on maximizing the effectiveness of our screening resources by addressing the largest source of imported hidden infections, rather than merely the state with the highest per-capita infection rate, thus filling a critical gap in regional defense against disease importation."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for mississippi for the next two-week horizon is based on a comprehensive risk assessment of potential disease importation. First, evaluating the "Infectious Density" ((E+I)/Population) for all potential origin states revealed mississippi as the highest-risk source, with an infectious density of approximately 0.001738. This is significantly higher than other states, indicating a greater likelihood of an individual traveler from mississippi being in an exposed or infected state. Second, considering the "Detection Utility" of such a policy, screening travelers from mississippi is estimated to capture and convert approximately 39 hidden infections (E and I) into confirmed (Q) cases daily. This represents the most substantial daily capture of potentially infectious individuals among all origin states, directly mitigating the risk of community transmission within texas. Although New Mexico contributes a large volume of inbound traffic, its lower infectious density results in a slightly smaller number of projected E+I conversions compared to mississippi. By targeting mississippi, texas prioritizes the state presenting the most concentrated infectious threat, ensuring that resources are optimally deployed to minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. This focused intervention directly addresses the most significant source of hidden infections, acting as a critical barrier against disease spread. This strategic choice is an independent optimization for texas\'s health security, focusing on the most impactful intervention given the current epidemiological data.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis focuses on identifying the origin state posing the highest systemic risk to Virginia. We first evaluated the 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population) for each potential origin state. Mississippi presents the highest infectious density at approximately 0.00174 (3320 E + 1783 I / 2925418 Population), significantly higher than Texas (0.000068), Arizona (0.00039), and New Mexico (0.00035). While Texas has the largest baseline inbound flow, its infectious density is remarkably low. The critical factor is 'Detection Utility,' which estimates the number of 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) that would be captured and converted to Q-status through a 90percent screening mandate. For Mississippi, with an average daily inbound flow of 3440, approximately 5.99 E and I individuals would be captured and isolated daily (3440 * 0.00174 * 0.90). This is the highest potential capture among all states, as other states, despite potentially higher absolute E+I populations, contribute fewer E+I individuals per inbound flow due to their lower infectious density or smaller inbound numbers. For example, Texas's much larger flow of 15325, combined with its low infectious density, would only yield about 0.94 E and I captures daily. This strategy prioritizes the state with the highest concentration of hidden infections per traveler, ensuring the most effective reduction of infectious individuals entering Virginia. This is a targeted intervention, focusing on a high-risk source to prevent further spread, rather than a broad, less efficient measure."

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy on travelers from new mexico for the next two weeks is based on a comprehensive analysis of potential disease importation risks. Although mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density at approximately 0.0029 (E+I)/Population, its average daily inbound flow to arizona is relatively low (1474 travelers). In contrast, new mexico, despite having a lower infectious density of approximately 0.00027, contributes the highest estimated number of daily hidden infections (E and I) to arizona due to its significantly larger average daily inbound flow of 19789 travelers. Specifically, an estimated 5.32 hidden infections (E+I) are projected to arrive daily from new mexico, compared to 4.30 from mississippi, 2.67 from virginia, and 2.59 from texas. Therefore, by targeting new mexico, the ninety percent screening mandate is estimated to convert approximately 4.79 hidden infections (E and I) into confirmed (Q) cases daily upon arrival, which represents the highest detection utility among all potential origin states. This strategy directly addresses the most significant source of imported hidden infections, thereby minimizing the potential for onward transmission within arizona and reducing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. This choice prioritizes the absolute reduction of incoming infectious individuals, rather than solely focusing on the highest prevalence state with lower travel volume, to maximize the protective effect for arizona's population."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The policy decision for mississippi focuses on minimizing the influx of hidden infections (Exposed and Infected individuals) to mitigate future confirmed cases and deaths. An analysis of potential origin states reveals that while Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density (0.0007516), followed by Arizona (0.0005543), the sheer volume of daily inbound travelers from Texas significantly outweighs the lower infectious densities of other states. Specifically, Texas, despite having the lowest infectious density (0.0000895), contributes the highest absolute number of estimated hidden infections into mississippi due to its substantial daily inbound flow (32701 travelers). Implementing a 90percent screening mandate on travelers from Texas is projected to capture approximately 37 hidden infections over the 14-day period, which is a greater number than any other state (e.g., Virginia would yield approximately 27 captures). This strategic choice prioritizes the interception of the largest absolute number of potential disease vectors, rather than solely focusing on the highest-density source, thus maximizing the immediate impact of the screening policy on reducing community spread within mississippi. This approach ensures that the limited intervention capacity is applied where it will have the greatest numerical effect on preventing disease importation and subsequent local transmission.'

2025-12-24 20:02:04,048 - od_agent - INFO - Region new mexico policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to target Texas for inbound screening is based on a comprehensive risk assessment. Texas exhibits the highest average daily inbound flow into New Mexico (75,115 individuals), making it the most significant source of potential disease importation. While its infectious density (0.00009) is not the absolute highest, the sheer volume of travelers from Texas means that even a moderate density translates to a substantial number of 'hidden infections' (E+I) entering New Mexico. Specifically, approximately 237 (E+I) individuals are estimated to enter daily from Texas. Implementing a 90percent screening mandate for these travelers would effectively convert around 213 of these hidden infections into the 'Q' compartment, significantly reducing the circulating infectious population. This strategy prioritizes the state with the largest overall contribution to inbound infection risk, aiming to capture a substantial number of otherwise undetected cases and prevent their spread within New Mexico. While other states like Mississippi have a higher infectious density, their inbound flow is considerably lower, leading to fewer absolute hidden infections to intercept."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis focuses on minimizing the importation of hidden infections into Texas to control the spread of disease. We first calculated the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each potential origin state. Mississippi exhibited the highest infectious density at 0.00309, significantly higher than arizona (0.00055), new mexico (0.00027), and virginia (0.00075). This indicates a greater proportion of exposed and infected individuals within Mississippi's population. Next, we estimated the number of 'hidden infections' (E+I) that would be captured and converted to Q-status for Texas. Mississippi contributes a daily average of 26,190 travelers to Texas. Applying its infectious density, approximately 81 hidden infections (26190 * 0.00309) would enter Texas daily. With a 90percent screening mandate, this policy would effectively convert roughly 73 of these hidden infections into confirmed (Q) cases daily, thereby preventing them from unknowingly spreading the disease within Texas. While other states like new mexico have higher total inbound flow, their lower infectious densities mean fewer hidden infections would be intercepted. Targeting Mississippi, despite its moderate inbound flow, addresses the most concentrated source of potential disease importation. This strategy aims to proactively reduce the 'hidden' infectious burden, preventing future confirmed cases and deaths in Texas, rather than competing for the most obvious high-volume state with potentially lower infectious density."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement Targeted Inbound Screening on Texas is based on a comprehensive risk assessment. Texas presents the highest combined risk due to its significant average daily inbound flow into Virginia (15,964 travelers) and a moderate infectious density of 0.000090 (E+I=2517, Population=28094866). While Mississippi has a higher infectious density, its inbound flow to Virginia is considerably lower (3,303). Arizona also has a moderate infectious density but a lower inbound flow (3,673). New Mexico, despite its closer proximity, has both a low infectious density and the lowest inbound flow (1,199). By targeting Texas, we estimate capturing approximately 2.04 'hidden infections' (0.9 * (2517 / 28094866) * 15964) per day, converting them to Q status and preventing further spread within Virginia. This strategy prioritizes the origin state that contributes the largest number of potentially infectious individuals, balancing the infectious density with the volume of inbound traffic. This approach aims to reduce the systemic risk of disease importation by focusing on the most impactful source, even if it's not the highest density, as other agents might target the highest density states, leaving high-volume traffic from states like Texas as a significant vulnerability if left unchecked."

2025-12-24 20:02:24,858 - od_agent - INFO - Region arizona policy response:
 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="After careful evaluation of potential origin states for inbound screening, new mexico has been selected for a targeted intervention. While mississippi initially presented with the highest infectious density, its inbound flow to arizona is relatively low. texas, despite a high total E+I count, has a lower infectious density and its significant inbound flow means that a 90percent screening would still leave a substantial number of unscreened individuals. new mexico, however, strikes a critical balance: it has the highest inbound flow to arizona among all states, and while its infectious density is not the absolute highest, the sheer volume of travelers means that even a moderate density translates to a significant number of potentially exposed or infected individuals entering arizona. The screening policy will effectively convert 90percent of these 'hidden' E and I cases into Q status upon arrival, thereby preventing their unmonitored spread within arizona and significantly reducing the risk of new local transmissions. This strategic choice aims to maximize the detection utility by focusing on the largest inbound corridor, thus having the most substantial impact on minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in arizona, rather than targeting a state with high infectious density but low mobility impact."

This higher density indicates a greater likelihood of infected individuals entering mississippi from Texas. Furthermore, Texas has the largest average daily inbound flow into mississippi at 38,622 individuals. This substantial flow, combined with its high infectious density, means a significant number of 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) are likely to enter mississippi from Texas daily. By applying the 90percent screening mandate, we estimate that approximately 19.8 hidden infections (0.9 * (1246+1932)/27331770 * 38622) would be detected and moved to the Confirmed (Q) compartment over the 14-day period. This detection utility is critical for reducing the hidden infectious population and slowing disease spread within mississippi. While other states like arizona and new mexico also contribute to inbound flow, their lower infectious densities or smaller flow volumes make them less impactful targets for this specific intervention. This strategy prioritizes targeting the largest source of potential hidden infections, ensuring the most effective use of our screening resources for the next two weeks."

 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='For the upcoming two-week horizon, New Mexico will implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy on travelers arriving from Arizona. This decision is based on a comprehensive risk assessment that considers both the infectious density of origin states and their specific inbound traffic volume to New Mexico. While Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density among the evaluated states at approximately 0.00499, its average daily inbound flow to New Mexico is relatively low at 1241, leading to an estimated 6.19 hidden infections per day. Texas, despite having the largest inbound flow of 84392 travelers daily, possesses a very low infectious density of about 0.000116, resulting in an estimated 9.79 hidden infections daily. Arizona, however, presents a significant combination of a moderate infectious density (approximately 0.000763) and a substantial average daily inbound flow of 30253 individuals into New Mexico. This combination translates to the highest estimated number of hidden infections (E+I) entering New Mexico from any single origin state, at approximately 23.08 per day. By implementing a 90percent screening mandate for Arizona, New Mexico expects to detect and move approximately 20.77 previously undetected Exposed or Infected individuals into the Confirmed (Q) compartment daily. This targeted intervention maximizes the detection utility, effectively reducing the hidden infectious population entering the community and mitigating the systemic risk of disease importation from the most impactful source. This strategy prioritizes addressing the most significant direct importation risk to New Mexico.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for mississippi is driven by a comprehensive risk assessment focused on minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in texas. Firstly, mississippi presents the highest 'Infectious Density' among all evaluated origin states, with an (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.00501. This significantly elevated proportion of exposed and infected individuals within its population makes it a high-risk source for disease importation. Secondly, the 'Detection Utility' of screening travelers from mississippi is projected to be the most impactful. Based on its average daily inbound flow to texas (30,835 travelers) and its high infectious density, approximately 154 hidden (E+I) individuals are estimated to enter texas daily from mississippi. With a 90percent screening effectiveness, this policy would convert an estimated 139 hidden infections daily into the 'Confirmed (Q)' compartment. This is a substantially higher number of captured infections compared to any other single origin state, ensuring a maximum reduction in the 'hidden' infectious population that could contribute to silent spread within texas. Lastly, regarding 'Coordination vs. Competition', this choice prioritizes addressing the most concentrated source of hidden infections rather than solely focusing on states with the largest overall inbound traffic. This strategic targeting of the highest-risk origin state allows for the most efficient use of the screening intervention, effectively mitigating a significant systemic risk of disease importation and complementing any broader regional defense efforts by focusing on the most potent threat."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The policy decision for the next two weeks focuses on mitigating inbound disease importation by implementing Targeted Inbound Screening on travelers from Texas. This choice is primarily driven by Texas's significant contribution to Virginia's inbound flow, presenting the largest potential for disease introduction. While Mississippi exhibits a higher infectious density ((E+I)/Pop), its inbound flow into Virginia is considerably lower, making the absolute number of hidden infections from Texas potentially greater due to its high volume. Specifically, Texas has an infectious density of approximately 0.000115, but its daily inbound flow of 17393 individuals means a substantial number of E and I individuals could be entering undetected. By screening Texas, we estimate capturing and converting approximately 90percent of these hidden infections to Q-status, thereby preventing their community spread within Virginia. This strategy aims to proactively manage the highest volume source of potential infection, balancing the infectious density of origin states with their actual mobility impact on Virginia. This is a coordinated approach, addressing the most prominent source of inbound traffic, which is a common strategy for states to manage their borders. This will help minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by reducing the 'hidden' infectious population entering Virginia."

2025-12-24 20:03:16,838 - od_agent - INFO - Region arizona policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to target Texas for inbound screening is based on a comprehensive risk assessment. First, we evaluated the 'Infectious Density' (E+I)/Population for all potential origin states. Texas, despite having a lower density than Mississippi, presents a significant risk due to its exceptionally high baseline average daily inbound flow into Arizona (42,323 travelers). Mississippi has a higher infectious density (0.64percent) compared to Texas (0.014percent) and New Mexico (0.021percent), but its inbound flow to Arizona is much lower (1,899). Virginia has a moderate density (0.12percent) and moderate flow (5,988). Second, the 'Detection Utility' of screening Texas travelers is substantial. With a 90percent screening mandate, we estimate capturing approximately 38.4 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) daily from Texas, converting them to Q-status upon arrival. This is significantly higher than the estimated 12.0 hidden infections from Mississippi, 1.4 from New Mexico, or 10.8 from Virginia, despite their varying infectious densities. This conversion directly reduces the 'hidden' infectious population circulating in Arizona. Finally, regarding 'Coordination vs. Competition,' targeting Texas addresses the largest single source of potential infection importation by raw numbers, which is a primary concern for Arizona given its shared border and high traffic volume. While Mississippi has a higher per-capita infection rate, the sheer volume from Texas makes it the most impactful target for minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona by reducing the largest influx of potentially infected individuals."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The decision to implement Targeted Inbound Screening for Texas is based on a comprehensive risk assessment focusing on infectious density, detection utility, and strategic coordination. Texas presents the highest infectious density among all potential origin states, with a combined (E+I) population of 3765 individuals. More critically, its average daily inbound flow into Mississippi is substantial at 47,996 travelers. This combination of high infectious density and significant mobility volume makes Texas the primary source of potential imported infections. By implementing a 90percent screening mandate, we estimate capturing approximately 34 (3765 * 0.0000782 * 0.90 * 47996) hidden infections (E and I) daily, directly converting them to Q-status. This proactive detection significantly reduces the hidden infectious population entering Mississippi, thereby mitigating local transmission risk. While other states like Arizona have a higher (E+I) count, their inbound flow is considerably lower, reducing their overall impact. This targeted approach focuses on the most impactful vector, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi by addressing the largest source of hidden infections without over-extending resources on less impactful origins. This strategy leverages targeted intervention to achieve maximum public health benefit.'

 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The policy decision for new mexico prioritizes minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by targeting the origin state with the highest potential for importing hidden infections (Exposed and Infected individuals) in absolute terms. An evaluation of source risk profiles revealed that mississippi has the highest infectious density ((E+I)/Population) at approximately 0.00804. However, its average daily inbound flow to new mexico is relatively low (1324 individuals). In contrast, arizona, while having a moderate infectious density of approximately 0.00099, contributes a significantly higher daily inbound flow to new mexico (36541 individuals). Texas has the highest inbound flow (101339) but the lowest infectious density (~0.00014). Calculating the estimated number of 'hidden infections' (E+I) entering new mexico daily from each state, arizona stands out with approximately 36.38 such individuals. Applying the 90percent screening mandate to travelers from arizona would convert an estimated 32.74 E and I cases to Q (Confirmed) status daily. This is substantially higher than the 12.95 conversions from texas, 9.59 from mississippi, or 2.26 from virginia. Therefore, by selecting arizona, new mexico is strategically intercepting the largest absolute number of potential hidden infections, effectively preventing them from circulating within the state. This approach maximizes the utility of the screening policy by focusing on the origin state that presents the greatest systemic risk of disease importation, rather than just the highest prevalence, ensuring the most impactful reduction in potential disease spread."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis focuses on minimizing the importation of hidden infections (E and I) into Texas. We first calculated the 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population) for all potential origin states. Mississippi presents the highest infectious density at approximately 0.0076, significantly higher than Arizona (0.0009), New Mexico (0.0002), and Virginia (0.0012). This high density indicates a greater proportion of the population in Mississippi is either exposed or actively infected but not yet confirmed, posing a substantial risk of disease importation. Furthermore, we estimated the 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) that would be captured by a 90percent screening mandate. Mississippi, despite having a lower absolute inbound flow compared to New Mexico, contributes the highest number of potential hidden infections (1821) when considering its high infectious density and average inflow. Implementing a targeted screening policy on Mississippi is projected to convert approximately 1639 (90percent of 1821) hidden infections into the 'Confirmed (Q)' compartment upon arrival in Texas. This strategy prioritizes the state with the highest concentration of unconfirmed cases, effectively reducing the 'hidden' infectious population entering our community and mitigating the risk of undetected spread within Texas. This is a targeted intervention aimed at the most potent source of hidden infections, preventing a potential surge in local transmissions."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis focuses on minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia by strategically targeting inbound traffic. We first assessed the 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population) for all potential origin states: Arizona (0.00099percent), Mississippi (0.0081percent), New Mexico (0.00021percent), and Texas (0.00014percent). While Mississippi shows the highest infectious density, its baseline inbound flow to Virginia is relatively low (4177). Texas, despite having a lower infectious density than Mississippi, presents a significantly larger baseline inbound flow (21124), making it the largest source of potential E and I cases entering Virginia. By targeting Texas, we estimate capturing approximately 90percent of its 1468 Exposed and 2297 Infected individuals, translating to a substantial number of 'Hidden Infections' (3388 * 0.9 = 3049) being immediately converted to Q-status upon arrival. This strategy prioritizes the absolute number of hidden infections that can be intercepted, given Texas's high inbound flow, rather than solely focusing on the highest per-capita infectiousness of a smaller flow. This decision aims to address the most impactful source of disease importation, effectively reducing the overall burden on Virginia's healthcare system and minimizing local spread, thereby reducing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths, without necessarily competing with other states that might target Mississippi based on density alone."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis focuses on minimizing the importation of hidden infections (E and I) into arizona, which are not currently isolated. We calculated the 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population) for all potential origin states. Mississippi presents the highest infectious density at 1.27percent, significantly higher than new mexico (0.02percent), texas (0.01percent), and virginia (0.15percent). This indicates a higher proportion of potentially infectious individuals within its general population. Furthermore, despite having a lower absolute inbound flow compared to texas or new mexico, the high infectious density of mississippi means that a targeted screening policy will yield a substantial detection utility. By implementing a 90percent screening mandate, we estimate that approximately 289 hidden infections (E+I) from mississippi will be identified and converted to Q-status upon arrival in arizona over the next 14 days, preventing their unmonitored spread within our community. This strategy prioritizes the state with the highest per-capita risk, effectively intercepting a significant number of infectious individuals who would otherwise contribute to local transmission chains. While other states have higher absolute inbound flows, their much lower infectious densities make them less impactful targets for this specific type of screening intervention. This decision acts as a proactive measure to control disease importation and mitigate future case surges in arizona."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement targeted inbound screening on Texas stems from a comprehensive risk assessment. Texas exhibits the highest infectious density among the potential origin states, with (E+I)/Population = 0.000164, indicating a notable proportion of hidden infections. While Arizona has a slightly higher E+I count, its population is smaller, leading to a lower overall density. More critically, Texas has by far the largest baseline average daily inbound flow into Mississippi, at 52,561 individuals. This significant volume, combined with its infectious density, presents the highest systemic risk for importing new cases. Screening Texas travelers is projected to capture approximately 3.9 new 'hidden' infections (E+I) daily, converting them to Q-status upon arrival. This action effectively prevents these individuals from silently spreading the disease within Mississippi, thereby minimizing the potential for new local transmissions. This strategy prioritizes targeting the largest inbound vector with a significant infectious population, aiming for maximum impact on reducing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi. While other states like Arizona also pose a risk, their lower inbound flow makes Texas the more impactful target for a single screening intervention."

2025-12-24 20:04:11,860 - od_agent - INFO - Region new mexico policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement targeted inbound screening for travelers from Mississippi is driven by a comprehensive risk assessment. Mississippi presents the highest infectious density among all potential origin states, with a combined (E+I)/Population ratio of 0.0127. This indicates a significantly larger proportion of hidden infections compared to other states like Arizona (0.0012), Texas (0.0001), or Virginia (0.0015). While Texas contributes the highest baseline inbound flow, its infectious density is remarkably low, suggesting that screening its travelers would yield fewer captured infections despite the volume. Conversely, Mississippi's high infectious density means that the 90percent screening mandate will convert a substantial number of 'E' and 'I' individuals directly into the 'Q' compartment upon arrival. This strategy prioritizes the detection and isolation of hidden infections from the most concentrated source, effectively reducing the introduction of undetected carriers into New Mexico's susceptible population. This targeted approach focuses on the most impactful source of potential disease importation, aiming to minimize future confirmed cases and deaths by preventing onward transmission from these high-risk, initially asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carriers. This choice allows New Mexico to address a critical importation risk without over-resourcing for states with lower infectious densities, ensuring efficient resource allocation and maximizing the utility of the screening intervention."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for Mississippi stems from a comprehensive assessment of infectious density and potential disease importation risk. Mississippi presents the highest Source Risk Profile, with an infectious density (E+I)/Population of approximately 1.24percent, significantly exceeding that of Arizona (0.13percent), Virginia (0.15percent), and New Mexico (0.02percent). This high density, combined with its average daily inbound flow into Texas, translates to an estimated 494 hidden infections (E and I) arriving daily from Mississippi. The Detection Utility of this intervention is substantial: a 90percent screening mandate for travelers from Mississippi would effectively capture and move approximately 444 infectious individuals into the Confirmed (Q) compartment each day. This is a far greater number than what could be captured from any other single origin state, making it the most impactful intervention to prevent undetected disease spread within Texas. This strategy prioritizes the most significant and quantifiable risk, ensuring that Texas's resources are directed towards mitigating the largest source of potential disease importation. This approach is not about competition with other states' policies, but rather a direct and data-driven response to protect Texas by addressing the most critical inbound epidemiological threat."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement Targeted Inbound Screening on Mississippi is based on a comprehensive risk assessment. Mississippi presents the highest 'Infectious Density' (0.0126) among all potential origin states, indicating a significantly larger proportion of hidden infections (E+I) within its population. While its absolute inbound flow to Virginia (4198 daily) is not the highest, the high infectious density means that a substantial number of individuals in the Exposed (E) and Infected (I) compartments are likely entering Virginia from this state. By implementing a 90percent screening mandate for travelers from Mississippi, an estimated 47 E and I individuals per day will be identified and moved into the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival. This proactive measure directly addresses the primary source of high-risk hidden infections, preventing their undetected spread within Virginia's susceptible population. Although Texas has a higher inbound flow, its infectious density is significantly lower (0.00016), meaning fewer hidden infections per traveler. This strategy focuses on minimizing the systemic risk of disease importation by targeting the most infectious source, rather than just the largest volume, thereby optimizing the reduction of cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia. This approach aims to fill a critical gap in regional defense by focusing on the most potent source of hidden infections."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The primary objective is to minimize the importation of hidden infections (Exposed and Infected individuals) into Arizona to curb the spread of disease and reduce cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. To achieve this, a Targeted Inbound Screening policy will be implemented for travelers originating from Mississippi for the next 14 days. This decision is based on a comprehensive assessment of each origin state\'s epidemiological profile and its associated risk of disease importation. Mississippi presents the highest "Infectious Density" among all potential origin states, with an (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.0187. This is significantly higher than Arizona\'s internal density (0.0018) and other states like Virginia (0.0019), New Mexico (0.0002), and Texas (0.0002). Despite Texas having the highest inbound flow to Arizona, its extremely low infectious density means fewer hidden infections are likely to be imported. Conversely, while Mississippi\'s average daily inbound flow is lower than Texas or New Mexico, its exceptionally high infectious density results in a substantial number of potential hidden infections. By targeting Mississippi, the rigorous ninety percent screening mandate is estimated to detect and move approximately 43.72 Exposed and Infected individuals into the Confirmed (Q) compartment daily. This constitutes a significantly higher number of hidden infections captured compared to screening any other single state; for instance, Virginia would yield about 10.11, Texas 8.33, and New Mexico 6.10 daily. This focused intervention maximizes the "Detection Utility" by converting a greater proportion of the "hidden" infectious population entering Arizona directly into the confirmed and isolated compartment, thereby preventing secondary transmissions within the community. This strategy represents the most impactful single-state intervention to mitigate importation risk, effectively addressing the most potent source of hidden infections.'

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The policy decision for the next two-week horizon focuses on minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi by strategically targeting inbound traffic. To identify the most impactful intervention, we first assessed the 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population) for each potential origin state. Virginia presented the highest infectious density at approximately 0.00195, followed by Arizona at 0.00158, Texas at 0.00019, and New Mexico at 0.00022. While Virginia exhibits the highest concentration of hidden infections, the overall risk also depends on the volume of travelers. Texas, despite having a lower infectious density compared to Virginia and Arizona, contributes the largest average daily inbound flow into Mississippi (60,331 travelers). This high volume, when combined with its infectious density, results in the highest estimated number of daily 'hidden' infections (E and I) entering Mississippi from any single state, approximately 11.2 individuals. Consequently, implementing a 90percent screening mandate for travelers from Texas is projected to capture and convert approximately 10.08 'hidden' infections (E and I) into confirmed (Q) cases daily. Over the 14-day policy period, this amounts to over 141 individuals, significantly reducing the potential for community transmission from imported cases. This targeted approach prioritizes the highest absolute number of potentially infectious individuals entering Mississippi, rather than solely focusing on the state with the highest infection rate, thereby maximizing the utility of the screening intervention to safeguard our population. This strategy addresses a high-volume source that, if left unchecked, would significantly contribute to the local epidemic curve."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="New Mexico's policy decision targets Mississippi for enhanced screening due to its significantly higher infectious density and substantial potential for hidden infections. Mississippi's (E+I)/Population ratio is 0.0192, which is orders of magnitude higher than Arizona (0.0016), Texas (0.00018), and Virginia (0.0019). While Mississippi's inbound flow to New Mexico (1605) is not the largest, its extreme infectious density means that even a smaller flow poses a disproportionately high risk for importing new cases. Implementing a 90percent screening mandate for travelers from Mississippi would effectively convert an estimated 28,000 hidden infections (E+I) into the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival, preventing them from silently spreading the disease within New Mexico's susceptible population. This strategy prioritizes mitigating the highest per-capita risk, rather than solely focusing on the largest traffic volume. By targeting Mississippi, we are addressing a critical source of potential disease importation that might be overlooked by other states focusing on their primary high-volume borders, thus filling a crucial gap in regional defense against silent spread and minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy on travelers from Mississippi is driven by a comprehensive risk assessment. Mississippi exhibits the highest "Infectious Density" among all potential origin states, with approximately 0.0187 of its population being in the Exposed (E) or Infected (I) compartments. This significantly surpasses the infectious densities of Arizona (~0.0016), New Mexico (~0.0002), and Virginia (~0.0020). Implementing a rigorous 90percent screening mandate for inbound traffic from Mississippi is projected to capture approximately 637 "Hidden Infections" (E and I individuals) daily, converting them to the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival in Texas. This figure is substantially higher than the estimated captures from other states (Arizona ~81, New Mexico ~33, Virginia ~50), indicating the greatest detection utility for minimizing disease importation. This targeted approach focuses on the source presenting the highest epidemiological risk per traveler, rather than solely on states with the largest overall inbound volume, thereby strategically mitigating the most impactful vector for new infections into Texas and complementing any broader regional defense efforts.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy on travelers from Mississippi for the next two weeks is driven by a comprehensive assessment of origin state risk profiles and the potential for disease importation into Virginia. Mississippi exhibits an alarmingly high infectious density of approximately 0.018663, calculated as (E+I)/Population, which is significantly greater than any other potential origin state, including Arizona (0.001582), New Mexico (0.000224), and Texas (0.000186), and even Virginia's own density (0.002271). This high density translates directly into a substantial number of 'hidden infections' (E+I) entering Virginia daily from Mississippi. Specifically, an estimated 83.19 E and I individuals are projected to enter Virginia from Mississippi each day. Implementing a 90percent screening mandate for these travelers is projected to capture and convert approximately 74.87 individuals from the Exposed and Infected compartments directly into the Confirmed (Q) compartment daily upon arrival. This represents a significant detection utility, as it prevents a large number of potentially infectious individuals from freely circulating within Virginia. While Mississippi may be an 'obvious' high-risk state, targeting it is justified by the overwhelming epidemiological data showing it as the most critical source of imported infections. This focused intervention aims to maximize the reduction of cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia by addressing the most impactful source of disease importation, effectively filling a critical gap in regional defense against undetected spread."

2025-12-24 20:06:06,895 - od_agent - INFO - Region arizona policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Arizona's policy for the next two weeks will implement targeted inbound screening for travelers arriving from mississippi. This decision is based on a comprehensive risk assessment of all potential origin states. Mississippi exhibits the highest 'Infectious Density' with approximately 2.7percent of its population currently in the Exposed (E) or Infected (I) compartments, significantly higher than other states such as virginia (~0.24percent), new mexico (~0.026percent), and texas (~0.021percent). While mississippi's total daily inbound flow to arizona (2337 travelers) is not the highest, its elevated infectious density translates into the largest number of 'hidden infections' (E and I individuals) entering arizona daily. Specifically, an estimated 63.04 E/I individuals would enter from mississippi each day without intervention. By implementing a rigorous ninety percent screening mandate, we project to capture and convert approximately 56.74 of these hidden infections directly into the Confirmed (Q) compartment daily. This strategic intervention maximizes the utility of the screening policy by targeting the source contributing the most significant number of undetected infectious individuals, thereby substantially reducing the risk of further disease spread within arizona and contributing directly to minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. This approach prioritizes impact over simply targeting the highest total traffic volume, focusing on the quality of risk rather than just quantity."

2025-12-24 20:06:12,136 - od_agent - INFO - Region mississippi policy response:
 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement targeted inbound screening on arizona is based on a multi-faceted risk assessment. Firstly, evaluating the source risk profile, arizona exhibits the highest infectious density among all potential origin states, with a combined (E+I)/Population of approximately 0.0020. This indicates a significant proportion of its population is either exposed or actively infected, posing a substantial risk of disease importation to mississippi. While virginia also has a high infectious density (0.0025), arizona's higher average daily inbound flow of 2819 travelers into mississippi makes it a more impactful source of potential hidden infections. Secondly, the detection utility of screening arizona travelers is estimated to be considerable. With an average of 16743 (E+I) individuals, and a 90percent screening effectiveness, we anticipate converting approximately 15069 hidden infections to Q-status upon arrival over the 14-day period. This proactive measure significantly reduces the influx of unconfirmed infectious individuals into mississippi, thereby mitigating local transmission risk. Lastly, concerning coordination versus competition, while other states might also target high-risk origins, our focus on arizona is justified by its high infectious density coupled with its substantial inbound flow to mississippi. This strategic selection aims to intercept a critical pathway for disease introduction, complementing broader regional efforts by addressing a specific, high-impact vector for our state. This policy is designed to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in mississippi by effectively isolating a significant source of imported infections."

2025-12-24 20:06:17,569 - od_agent - INFO - Region new mexico policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to target Mississippi for inbound screening is driven by a comprehensive assessment of infection risk and detection utility. Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density (E+I)/Population among all potential origin states, with a value of approximately 0.028 (33533 E + 15996 I / 1,740,867 total population). This significantly surpasses other states like Arizona (0.0019), Texas (0.0002), and Virginia (0.0024). While Mississippi's average daily inbound flow into New Mexico is not the highest (1,565), the extremely high proportion of hidden infections (E+I) within its population presents a substantial risk of disease importation. Implementing a 90percent screening mandate for travelers from Mississippi will effectively capture a large number of these hidden infections, converting them to Q-status upon arrival. This strategy aims to prevent a significant influx of undetected infectious individuals, thereby minimizing future cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico. By targeting Mississippi, we are addressing a critical source risk that might otherwise be overlooked if focusing solely on states with higher raw inbound numbers but lower infectious densities. This approach prioritizes mitigating the systemic risk of high-prevalence importation over merely reducing total traffic from lower-prevalence origins."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for mississippi for the next two weeks is driven by a comprehensive risk assessment. Mississippi presents the highest infectious density among all potential origin states, with approximately 2.7percent of its population currently in the Exposed (E) or Infected (I) compartments. This significantly elevated proportion indicates a heightened per-capita risk of disease importation. Coupled with a substantial average daily inbound flow of 36,298 individuals from mississippi into Texas, this high infectious density translates into an estimated 979 hidden infections (E and I) potentially entering Texas every day. The proposed 90percent screening mandate for travelers from mississippi is projected to effectively detect and move approximately 881 of these hidden infectious individuals daily into the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival. This intervention offers the most substantial reduction in the influx of undetected infectious individuals compared to targeting any other state, which would yield significantly fewer Q-conversions. By focusing on mississippi, Texas directly addresses the most potent source of disease importation, proactively minimizing the introduction of new infections into the local population and thereby working to reduce cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement targeted inbound screening for travelers from mississippi is based on a comprehensive risk assessment. mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density (E+I)/Population at approximately 0.026978, significantly exceeding all other potential origin states. This indicates a substantially higher proportion of exposed and infected individuals within its population, posing a greater per-traveler risk. The detection utility of this policy is also maximized by targeting mississippi; a 90percent screening mandate is estimated to capture approximately 117.71 'hidden infections' (E and I cases) daily, converting them to Q-status upon arrival. This number is vastly superior to the estimated captures from other states, such as arizona (11.84) or texas (5.36), despite texas having a larger overall inbound flow. Our strategy prioritizes the source with the highest concentration of hidden infections, ensuring that the intervention effectively mitigates the most potent source of disease importation into virginia. This is a direct measure to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by preventing the undetected spread of the virus from a high-prevalence area."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona over the next two weeks, a Targeted Inbound Screening policy is recommended for travelers arriving from Mississippi. Evaluating the source risk profile, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population at approximately 0.0368. This is significantly higher compared to New Mexico (0.000305), Texas (0.000227), and Virginia (0.003039). Despite a relatively moderate daily inbound flow to Arizona (2348 travelers), the high infectious density translates into a substantial number of potential 'hidden infections' (E and I) entering Arizona. Our analysis estimates that screening Mississippi travelers would detect approximately 77.84 hidden infections daily, converting them to Q-status. This detection utility far surpasses that of other states: Virginia (16.48), Texas (9.42), and New Mexico (6.89). By targeting Mississippi, we address the most significant single source of potential disease importation, effectively reducing the hidden infectious population entering our community and minimizing the risk of local transmission. This strategy focuses on the most impactful intervention, ensuring that the highest concentration of infectious individuals is intercepted, thereby optimizing resource allocation for epidemic control."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement targeted inbound screening for Texas is driven by a comprehensive risk assessment. First, in terms of Source Risk Profile, Texas exhibits a significant 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population) of approximately 0.000227, which is a moderate risk compared to other states like Arizona (0.000024) or Virginia (0.000309) but higher than New Mexico (0.00000002). However, the critical factor is the sheer volume of inbound flow from Texas, averaging 57,006 individuals daily, which is substantially higher than any other origin state. This high volume means even a moderate infectious density translates to a large absolute number of potentially infected individuals entering Mississippi. Second, regarding Detection Utility, by targeting Texas, we estimate that approximately 11.6 hidden infections (90percent of E+I) will be captured and converted to Q-status daily. While Virginia has a higher individual infectious density, its lower inbound flow results in fewer total hidden infections captured (around 4.7 daily). The objective is to prevent the largest absolute number of hidden infections from entering and spreading within Mississippi. Third, concerning Coordination vs. Competition, targeting Texas is a strategic choice. While other states might also target high-volume origins, Mississippi's immediate priority is to mitigate the largest single source of potential importation. This action addresses the most impactful inflow, filling a critical gap in regional defense by proactively managing the dominant inbound vector, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths within Mississippi."

 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="For the upcoming 2-week horizon, New Mexico will implement a targeted inbound screening policy on travelers from Arizona. Our analysis prioritized states based on their infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, and the volume of inbound travelers to New Mexico, aiming to maximize the detection of hidden infections (E and I) and convert them to confirmed (Q) cases upon arrival. Mississippi exhibited the highest infectious density at approximately 3.68percent, indicating a significant internal spread. However, its average daily inbound flow to New Mexico is relatively low (1,638 travelers). Arizona, while having a lower infectious density of about 0.24percent, contributes a much higher daily inbound flow of 34,721 travelers. Texas has the largest inbound flow (119,576), but its infectious density is very low at 0.023percent. Virginia has a moderate infectious density of 0.30percent with a low inbound flow (2,367). Calculating the potential hidden infections entering New Mexico daily, Arizona stands out with an estimated 82.72 E/I cases, followed by Mississippi with 60.32, Texas with 27.12, and Virginia with 7.19. Applying a 90percent screening mandate, targeting Arizona is projected to convert approximately 74.45 hidden infections into confirmed cases daily, which is the highest detection utility among all options. This strategic focus on Arizona, despite Mississippi's higher individual infectious density, ensures that New Mexico intercepts the most significant volume of potentially infectious individuals, directly minimizing the risk of local transmission from imported cases. This approach is a pragmatic choice to fortify New Mexico's defenses against disease importation by addressing the most impactful source."

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement Targeted Inbound Screening for travelers from New Mexico is based on a strategic evaluation of source risk and detection utility. New Mexico presents the highest 'Infectious Density' (E+I)/Population at 0.000305, indicating a relatively high proportion of hidden infections within its population compared to other states. While its total inbound flow into Texas (142,786) is substantial, it is not the highest. However, the estimated 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) that could be captured and converted to Q-status from New Mexico travelers is 43.5, which is significant when considering the 90percent screening effectiveness. This policy aims to proactively intercept a considerable number of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carriers before they can spread the disease within Texas. By targeting New Mexico, we are addressing a notable source of potential importation without necessarily competing for resources with other states that might focus on the absolute highest inflow or highest E+I count. This approach allows for a focused intervention that directly contributes to minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by reducing the hidden infectious population entering our community."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="An analysis of the source risk profiles indicates that mississippi presents the highest infectious density, calculated as the proportion of (Exposed + Infected) individuals within its total population. Mississippi's infectious density stands at approximately 0.0368, which is considerably higher than arizona (0.0024), new mexico (0.0003), and texas (0.0002). This elevated density implies a greater likelihood of undetected infections among travelers originating from mississippi. Consequently, the detection utility of a targeted screening policy on mississippi is maximized. By implementing a ninety percent screening mandate for inbound travelers from mississippi, virginia is projected to capture and move approximately 146 hidden infections (E and I) into the Confirmed (Q) compartment daily. This significantly surpasses the potential capture from any other state; for instance, screening arizona would yield only about 14 such cases daily, despite its comparable inflow. This focused intervention directly targets the most potent source of disease importation, effectively reducing the hidden infectious burden on virginia's community. While mississippi is the most apparent high-risk state, this decision prioritizes maximizing the reduction of imported cases and deaths within virginia, optimizing our local public health outcomes without needing to consider broader, hypothetical coordination strategies with other states."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for Mississippi is based on a multi-faceted assessment of risk and potential utility. Firstly, evaluating the Source Risk Profile, Mississippi presents the highest infectious density with an (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.052 (5.2percent), significantly higher than other potential origin states like New Mexico (0.0003), Texas (0.0004), and Virginia (0.0039). While its inbound flow to Arizona (1984 individuals/day) is not the highest, the extremely high prevalence of infected and exposed individuals within this population poses a substantial risk of disease importation. Secondly, the Detection Utility of screening Mississippi travelers is estimated to be high. With an E+I count of 57,138 in Mississippi's average population, a 90percent screening mandate would effectively capture and convert a significant number of 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) into the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival in Arizona. This direct conversion prevents these individuals from silently spreading the disease within Arizona's susceptible population, thereby mitigating potential outbreaks and reducing the burden on our healthcare system. Finally, regarding Coordination vs. Competition, targeting Mississippi, despite its lower absolute inbound flow compared to Texas, is a strategic choice. Its exceptionally high infectious density makes it a critical vector for disease importation. While other states might focus on larger traffic volumes, addressing this highly concentrated source of infection is crucial for minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Arizona. This approach addresses a unique and potent risk, complementing broader regional defense efforts."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for Texas is based on a multi-faceted risk assessment. Texas presents the highest 'Infectious Density' among all potential origin states, with a significant number of both Exposed (E) and Infected (I) individuals relative to its population. Specifically, its (E+I)/Population is approximately 0.00042, which is higher than arizona (0.000004), new mexico (0.0000003), and virginia (0.000003). While other states might have higher E or I counts, Texas combines a substantial infectious population with an exceptionally high average daily inbound flow into Mississippi (51,070 individuals), dwarfing flows from all other states. This high inbound flow from a high-density infectious source poses the greatest systemic risk for disease importation. The 'Detection Utility' of screening Texas travelers is estimated to be the most impactful. With a 90percent screening efficacy, we anticipate converting a significant number of 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) into 'Confirmed (Q)' cases upon arrival, thereby preventing their unmonitored spread within Mississippi. Given the sheer volume of travelers, even a slightly lower E or I density from a state with much higher inflow can represent a greater absolute number of hidden infections. Our strategy prioritizes states that contribute the most to the absolute number of E and I individuals entering Mississippi. This approach addresses the most prominent threat to our state, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by intercepting a large proportion of imported infections at the border. This choice represents a coordination strategy, targeting the most obvious high-risk source, as other states would likely also identify Texas as a significant contributor to regional spread."

 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="For the upcoming 14-day horizon, New Mexico's inbound traffic control strategy focuses on minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by intercepting hidden infections at the border. Our analysis prioritizes states based on their infectious density, defined as (Exposed + Infected) / Total Population, and the absolute number of potentially infectious individuals traveling into New Mexico daily. While Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density (0.046), its relatively low average daily inbound flow of 1,219 individuals to New Mexico limits the overall impact of a targeted screening policy. Conversely, Texas has the highest inbound flow (113,536) but a very low infectious density (0.0004), meaning fewer infectious individuals per traveler. Arizona, however, presents the optimal balance for intervention. With an infectious density of 0.003 and a substantial average daily inbound flow of 30,995 into New Mexico, screening travelers from Arizona is projected to convert approximately 83 Exposed or Infected individuals to Confirmed (Q) status daily. This represents the highest potential daily capture of hidden infections among all candidate states. By rigorously screening 90percent of these travelers, we effectively identify and isolate a significant number of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carriers, preventing them from contributing to community transmission within New Mexico. This targeted approach maximizes the utility of our screening resources by focusing on the origin state where the intervention will yield the greatest reduction in imported disease risk, directly supporting our goal of mitigating disease spread and protecting public health."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for travelers from Mississippi is driven by a comprehensive assessment of systemic risks and potential mitigation effectiveness. Mississippi exhibits the highest Infectious Density among all candidate origin states, with approximately 4.65percent of its population being either Exposed (E) or Infected (I). This significantly elevated proportion means that, per traveler, the likelihood of importing a hidden infection into Texas is substantially higher from Mississippi than from any other state. While New Mexico has a higher inbound flow, its extremely low infectious density means fewer actual hidden infections would be intercepted. Targeting Mississippi, despite its moderate inbound flow of 31,542 individuals, is projected to result in the highest number of 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) being identified and converted to Q-status, estimated at approximately 1319 individuals over the two-week horizon. This robust detection utility directly addresses our objective of minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by preventing a substantial number of potentially infectious individuals from contributing to community transmission within Texas. This intervention focuses on the most concentrated source of risk, providing the most impactful reduction in disease importation for Texas."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="For the upcoming 2-week horizon, virginia will implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for travelers originating from mississippi. Our analysis indicates mississippi presents the highest Source Risk Profile with an Infectious Density (E+I)/Population of approximately 0.046489, significantly higher than other potential origin states. This high density suggests a greater likelihood of exposed or infected individuals traveling from mississippi. The Detection Utility of this intervention is substantial: by screening mississippi travelers, an estimated 162 hidden infections (E and I cases) per day will be captured and converted to Q-status upon arrival in virginia. This is by far the highest number among all evaluated states, indicating a strong potential to prevent onward transmission within virginia. In terms of Coordination vs. Competition, mississippi is the clear and obvious high-risk state impacting virginia's inbound health security. Prioritizing screening for this state directly addresses the most significant immediate threat, aligning with our objective to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in virginia by effectively reducing imported hidden infections."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Arizona's policy for the next two weeks will focus on targeted inbound screening from Mississippi. This decision is based on a multi-faceted risk assessment. Firstly, Mississippi presents the highest infectious density among all potential origin states, with a combined (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 6.2percent (35374 E + 17309 I / 840090 S + ...). This significantly surpasses other states like Virginia (0.48percent), Texas (0.05percent), and New Mexico (0.04percent). This high density suggests a greater probability of infected or exposed individuals entering Arizona from Mississippi. Secondly, the detection utility of screening Mississippi travelers is substantial. With an average daily inbound flow of 1831 individuals, and a 90percent screening mandate, we estimate capturing approximately 87 'hidden infections' (E+I) per day (1831 * 0.062 * 0.90). This conversion of E and I to Q upon arrival prevents these individuals from silently spreading the disease within Arizona's susceptible population. While Texas has a higher absolute inflow, its significantly lower infectious density makes screening less impactful in terms of hidden infection capture per traveler. Lastly, regarding coordination vs. competition, Mississippi's high infectious density makes it an obvious high-risk target. By screening, Arizona proactively mitigates a significant external threat, potentially complementing broader regional efforts without necessarily overlapping with other states that might target larger, but less densely infected, origins. This focused intervention aims to minimize disease importation and subsequent local transmission, thereby reducing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy on travelers from Virginia is based on a comprehensive risk assessment focusing on minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi. First, evaluating the 'Source Risk Profile' by calculating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for all potential origin states revealed Virginia as the highest-risk state with an infectious density of approximately 0.00468, followed by Arizona (0.00372), Texas (0.00054), and New Mexico (0.00041). This indicates a more active and widespread hidden infection within Virginia's population. Second, assessing the 'Detection Utility,' we estimated the number of 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) that would be captured and converted to Q-status daily through a 90percent screening mandate. Despite its moderate inbound flow of 5593 travelers, Virginia contributes an estimated 26.19 E+I individuals daily, leading to approximately 23.57 captures. This figure is marginally higher than Texas, which, despite its significantly larger inbound flow of 47740, contributes about 25.62 E+I individuals daily, resulting in 23.06 captures due to its much lower infectious density. Therefore, targeting Virginia offers the highest immediate impact in preventing the introduction of hidden infections into Mississippi. Finally, regarding 'Coordination vs. Competition,' while Virginia might be considered an 'obvious' high-risk choice due to its high infectious density, this policy directly addresses the most potent source of imported infections for Mississippi. Prioritizing the state that presents both a high per-capita risk and the largest absolute number of capturable hidden infections ensures the most effective use of screening resources for our state's protection, directly supporting the objective of minimizing local disease burden."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico, we recommend implementing a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for travelers originating from Mississippi for the next two weeks. Our analysis of source risk profiles reveals that Mississippi currently has the highest infectious density at 5.25percent ((35374 E + 17309 I) / 1000000 population-scaled), significantly higher than Texas (0.05percent), Arizona (0.37percent), and Virginia (0.49percent). While Mississippi's average daily inbound flow into New Mexico (1134) is not the highest, its extremely high infectious density means that a substantial number of hidden infections (E and I) would be captured and converted to Q-status upon arrival. Specifically, screening 90percent of these 1134 travelers would effectively detect and isolate approximately 53 (0.9 * 1134 * 0.0525) infected individuals who might otherwise contribute to local spread. This intervention focuses on a clear, high-risk source, preventing significant disease importation, and complementing potential actions by other states which might target larger, but less dense, traffic corridors. This targeted approach prioritizes impact over volume, reducing systemic risk effectively."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The decision to implement Targeted Inbound Screening on travelers from Mississippi is primarily driven by its significantly high infectious density and substantial inbound flow into Texas. Mississippi presents the highest (E+I)/Population ratio at approximately 5.8percent, indicating a concentrated hidden infectious population. While New Mexico has a lower infectious density, its inbound flow is also considerably lower. Arizona and Virginia have lower infectious densities than Mississippi, making them less critical targets for immediate intervention. By focusing on Mississippi, we estimate capturing approximately 388 hidden infections (E+I) per day that would otherwise enter Texas undetected. This strategic interception aims to convert these individuals to the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival, thereby preventing further community transmission within Texas. This approach targets the most potent source of potential disease importation, optimizing the utility of our screening efforts to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths, even if it means not targeting a state with the absolute highest raw number of E+I, but rather the highest risk per capita from a significant inbound source.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis focuses on minimizing imported disease burden by identifying the origin state with the highest 'Infectious Density' and significant inbound flow into Virginia. Mississippi stands out with an infectious density of approximately 0.061 (E+I)/Population, significantly higher than Arizona (0.0037), New Mexico (0.0004), and Texas (0.0005). Although Texas has a much larger absolute inbound flow, its infectious density is very low. By targeting Mississippi, we estimate that the 90percent screening mandate will convert approximately 31,214 (E+I) individuals from E and I to Q status (0.90 * (35374 E + 17309 I)) per 14-day period, effectively neutralizing a substantial hidden infectious population from the state with the highest per-capita infection risk. This strategy prioritizes the origin with the most concentrated infectious population, aiming to capture a large proportion of potentially undetected cases that would otherwise seed new infections within Virginia. This decision reflects a coordinated approach to regional defense, addressing a clear high-risk vector without necessarily competing for the same 'obvious' high-volume states that other agents might target, as Mississippi represents a high-density, moderate-flow risk."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for mississippi is based on a comprehensive evaluation of source risk, detection utility, and strategic impact. mississippi exhibits an exceptionally high infectious density of approximately 0.0519 (43,321 E+I individuals out of a total population of 834,379). This is significantly higher than any other potential origin state. Despite its relatively lower average daily inbound flow to arizona (1,898 travelers) compared to states like texas or new mexico, the high infectious density translates to an estimated 98.54 hidden infections (E+I) entering arizona daily from mississippi. Implementing a 90percent screening mandate would effectively convert approximately 88.69 of these hidden infections to confirmed (Q) cases daily, thereby isolating them and preventing further community transmission within arizona. This proactive measure targets the most concentrated source of potential disease importation, directly reducing the hidden infectious population and consequently minimizing future confirmed cases and deaths in arizona. This approach prioritizes addressing the most impactful source of hidden infections, making mississippi the clear choice for intervention.'

2025-12-24 20:10:22,915 - od_agent - INFO - Region mississippi policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement targeted inbound screening on Texas is based on a comprehensive risk assessment. Texas exhibits the highest 'Infectious Density' among the origin states, with a significant number of both Exposed (4415) and Infected (7153) individuals within its large population. This high density, coupled with the substantial baseline daily inbound flow from Texas to Mississippi (42933 travelers), presents the greatest systemic risk of disease importation. By screening Texas, we estimate that approximately 107 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) will be detected and converted to Q-status daily (0.9 * (4415+7153) / 24042531 * 42933). This intervention directly targets the largest source of potential hidden infections, effectively reducing the 'hidden' infectious population entering Mississippi. While other states like Arizona and Virginia also have notable E and I populations, their inbound flows to Mississippi are significantly lower, making Texas the most impactful target for minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. This strategy focuses on the most prominent threat, aligning with a coordinated regional defense by addressing the largest single contributor to potential disease spread into Mississippi."

 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico, we recommend implementing targeted inbound screening for travelers from Arizona. Our analysis reveals Arizona presents the highest infectious density with a significant number of 'hidden' infections (E+I) contributing to potential importation risk. While Texas has a higher baseline inflow, Arizona's (E+I)/Population ratio is substantially greater (0.0047 vs. 0.0004 for Texas). By targeting Arizona, we estimate capturing approximately 38,063 hidden infections (90percent of 42,292) and converting them to Q-status upon arrival, thereby preventing their unmonitored spread within New Mexico. This strategy focuses on the most concentrated source of potential infection, aiming to significantly reduce the undetected infectious population entering our state. This is a coordinated approach, targeting the most obvious high-risk state to maximize the impact of our limited screening capacity and proactively address a critical vector of disease importation."

2025-12-24 20:10:33,113 - od_agent - INFO - Region texas policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement targeted inbound screening on mississippi is based on a comprehensive risk assessment. Mississippi presents the highest infectious density among all potential origin states, with a significant (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 4.31percent. This indicates a substantial hidden infectious population that could easily seed new outbreaks in texas. By targeting mississippi, we estimate capturing around 39,000 hidden infections (E+I) over the two-week period, converting them to confirmed (Q) status upon arrival due to the 90percent screening mandate. This proactive measure significantly reduces the influx of silently spreading carriers into texas, thereby mitigating potential community transmission and minimizing future confirmed cases and deaths. While other states like arizona and virginia also show notable E+I populations, their infectious densities are considerably lower. New mexico's risk profile is the lowest. Therefore, focusing on mississippi allows us to address the most immediate and concentrated source of disease importation, maximizing the impact of our limited intervention capacity. This strategy aims to prevent a surge in local cases by intercepting a large number of infectious individuals at the point of entry, rather than waiting for them to manifest symptoms within the community."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement Targeted Inbound Screening on Texas is based on a multi-faceted assessment aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia. Firstly, evaluating the Source Risk Profile, Texas presents the highest number of 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) among all origin states, with approximately 11,568 individuals. While its Infectious Density (0.00048) is not the absolute highest, the sheer volume of its population means a larger absolute number of potential carriers. Secondly, the Detection Utility for Texas is paramount due to its substantial average daily inbound flow into Virginia, which is 26,283. Applying a 90percent screening mandate to this flow would effectively capture and convert a significant number of E and I individuals to Q-status, thereby preventing a large potential influx of undetected infections. This intervention is estimated to convert approximately 2.9 (E+I) individuals daily from Texas's inflow into Q, substantially reducing the hidden infectious load entering Virginia. Lastly, regarding Coordination vs. Competition, targeting Texas is a strategic choice. Its high absolute number of E+I individuals combined with its significant inbound traffic makes it the most impactful origin to screen, addressing a primary source of potential importation. While other states might have higher 'Infectious Density' ratios, their lower absolute E+I numbers and significantly smaller inbound flows mean that screening them would yield a much lower number of 'Q-conversions' compared to the impact gained by focusing on Texas. This policy prioritizes intercepting the largest volume of hidden infections from the most significant inbound pathway."

2025-12-24 20:10:56,800 - od_agent - INFO - Region arizona policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for mississippi is driven by a comprehensive assessment of each origin state's risk profile and the potential utility of screening. mississippi presents the highest infectious density (E+I)/Population at approximately 5.16percent, significantly surpassing other states such as virginia (~0.7percent), new mexico (~0.05percent), and texas (~0.046percent). Despite having the lowest average daily inbound flow to arizona (1731 travelers), this exceptionally high infectious density means that each traveler from mississippi carries a proportionally higher risk of being exposed or infected. Implementing a 90percent screening mandate for mississippi is projected to convert approximately 1125 hidden infections (E and I) into confirmed (Q) cases over the 14-day policy period. This is the highest estimated number of Q-conversions among all potential origin states, far exceeding the 495 from virginia, 256 from texas, or 180 from new mexico. By targeting mississippi, arizona aims to capture the largest number of hidden infectious individuals entering the state, thereby substantially reducing the seeding of new infections and minimizing future cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. This strategy prioritizes the source with the highest per-capita risk, ensuring the most impactful intervention to protect arizona's population from imported disease."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for travelers from Virginia is based on a comprehensive analysis of source risk, detection utility, and strategic impact. Virginia exhibits the highest calculated daily influx of 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) into Mississippi, estimated at approximately 26.56 individuals, despite having a moderate inbound flow compared to Texas. Its infectious density (E+I)/Population is 0.006950, which is among the highest, indicating a substantial proportion of undetected cases within its population. By screening travelers from Virginia, we anticipate converting approximately 23.91 hidden infections to confirmed (Q) status daily, significantly reducing the undetected infectious load entering Mississippi. This intervention targets the most potent source of disease importation for our state, directly aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. While Texas has a much larger inbound flow, its lower infectious density results in fewer hidden infections per day (18.17) compared to Virginia. Arizona, with a similar infectious density, has a much lower inbound flow, leading to fewer hidden infections (9.91). New Mexico poses the least risk in terms of hidden infections. Therefore, focusing on Virginia provides the maximum utility in preventing disease spread within Mississippi, addressing the most critical inbound vector for our specific context."

2025-12-24 20:11:10,498 - od_agent - INFO - Region new mexico policy response:
 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to target Arizona for inbound screening is driven by a comprehensive assessment of source risk, detection utility, and strategic coordination. Arizona presents the highest infectious density among all candidate states, with an estimated (E+I)/Population of 0.0058 compared to Mississippi's 0.021, Texas's 0.0004, and Virginia's 0.0073. While Mississippi has a higher infectious density, Arizona's significantly larger baseline daily inflow into New Mexico (12,775,936 vs. 1,731 for Mississippi) means that targeting Arizona will result in a much larger absolute number of hidden infections being screened. Specifically, an estimated 59,576 hidden infections (E+I) from Arizona would be captured and converted to Q-status, compared to 3,090 from Mississippi, 4,773 from Texas, and 1,280 from Virginia. This substantial capture of infections directly entering New Mexico from Arizona provides the greatest utility in mitigating disease importation and reducing the burden on New Mexico's healthcare system. By selecting Arizona, we are addressing the most significant source of potential imported cases, aligning our intervention with the primary risk factor. This strategy aims to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico by intercepting a large volume of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers at the border, thereby reducing community transmission driven by external sources."

 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for Arizona is based on a comprehensive evaluation of source risk profiles and detection utility. While Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density at approximately 0.0516 ((E+I)/Population), its daily inbound flow to Texas is 29,713, leading to an estimated 1,533 daily hidden infections (E+I). In contrast, Arizona, with an infectious density of 0.00577, has a significantly higher average daily inbound flow of 45,081. This combination means that Arizona contributes the largest absolute number of hidden infections into Texas daily, estimated at 2,600. A 90percent screening mandate for Arizona would thus capture approximately 2,340 hidden infections per day, totaling over 32,760 individuals moved to the Confirmed (Q) compartment over the 14-day period. This represents the highest potential reduction in the infectious population among all origin states. This strategy prioritizes capturing the largest volume of incoming infections to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas, rather than solely focusing on the state with the highest infection rate but lower overall traffic. This approach aims to maximize the immediate impact of border screening on the overall disease trajectory within Texas.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy on Mississippi is driven by a comprehensive risk assessment. Mississippi exhibits the highest 'Infectious Density' among all potential origin states, with a combined (E+I) population of approximately 39,784 within a total population of 765,000, leading to a density of 5.2percent. This significantly surpasses Arizona (0.59percent), Texas (0.02percent), and New Mexico (0.05percent). Targeting Mississippi will lead to the capture of an estimated 3,240 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) over the two-week period. This substantial conversion of E and I individuals to Q status upon arrival will prevent them from circulating within Virginia's susceptible population, thereby directly reducing potential disease spread and minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. This strategy prioritizes addressing the most potent external source of infection, ensuring that Virginia's resources are focused on mitigating the highest risk of importation, rather than diffusing efforts across lower-risk origins. While other states also contribute to inbound flow, their lower infectious densities mean that screening them would yield fewer 'Q-conversions' and thus have a less significant impact on Virginia's epidemic trajectory."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Our analysis for the upcoming two-week horizon focuses on minimizing disease importation into arizona by identifying the origin state with the highest potential for undetected infections entering our community. We assessed the "Infectious Density" (E+I)/Population for all potential origin states and the absolute number of hidden infections (E and I) expected from their average daily inbound flow. Mississippi emerged as the most critical source, exhibiting an infectious density of approximately 0.075, significantly higher than other states. This high density, even with a moderate inbound flow of 1989 individuals, translates to an estimated 149.79 hidden infections (E+I) entering arizona daily. Implementing a 90percent screening mandate on travelers from mississippi is projected to convert approximately 135 of these hidden infections directly into the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival. This intervention is crucial for preventing the silent spread of the disease within arizona, as these individuals would otherwise contribute to the unconfirmed infectious pool. While states like texas and new mexico have higher inbound flows, their infectious densities are considerably lower (0.000715 and 0.000539, respectively), resulting in fewer hidden infections (33.77 and 16.51) that would be detected. Therefore, targeting mississippi represents the most impactful strategy for intercepting a significant number of infectious individuals, directly reducing the risk of further community transmission and ultimately minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in arizona. This decision prioritizes the most potent source of hidden infections, leveraging the screening policy to maximize public health benefit.'

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="For the next two-week horizon, mississippi will implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy on travelers arriving from virginia. This decision is based on a comprehensive risk assessment of all potential origin states. Virginia currently exhibits the highest infectious density, with approximately 0.008355 of its population being in the Exposed (E) or Infected (I) compartments. While its total inbound flow to mississippi is not the highest, the combination of this high infectious density and its average daily inbound flow results in the greatest number of 'hidden' infections entering our state. Specifically, screening inbound travelers from virginia is estimated to convert approximately 30.92 Exposed or Infected individuals directly into the Confirmed (Q) compartment daily. This significantly reduces the potential for undetected community spread within mississippi. This strategic focus on virginia represents a direct and impactful intervention against the most potent source of imported disease, prioritizing the minimization of cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in mississippi by proactively identifying and isolating infectious individuals at our border."

2025-12-24 20:12:30,190 - od_agent - INFO - Region new mexico policy response:
 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The primary objective is to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico by mitigating the risk of disease importation. To achieve this, we evaluated potential origin states based on their infectious density, the volume of inbound travelers to New Mexico, and the potential number of hidden infections (E and I) that could be detected and isolated. For the source risk profile, we calculated the infectious density ((E+I)/Population) for all potential origin states. Mississippi exhibited the highest infectious density at approximately 0.075, followed by Virginia (0.0084), Arizona (0.0071), and Texas (0.0007). While Mississippi has the highest density, its average daily inbound flow to New Mexico is comparatively low (1,497 travelers). Conversely, Texas has the lowest infectious density but the highest inbound flow (99,222 travelers). Arizona presents a moderate infectious density but a substantial inbound flow (32,596 travelers). For detection utility, to maximize the impact of a targeted screening policy, we focused on identifying the state that would yield the highest number of detected hidden infections (E and I) converted to the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival. By multiplying each state's infectious density by its average daily inbound flow to New Mexico, we estimated the daily average of E and I travelers entering New Mexico. Arizona was projected to contribute approximately 233 E and I individuals daily, Mississippi 113, Texas 71, and Virginia 17. Implementing a 90percent screening mandate would therefore convert roughly 210 E/I individuals from Arizona to Q status daily, significantly more than any other state. This direct conversion prevents these individuals from silently spreading the disease within New Mexico's community. Regarding coordination versus competition, our strategy prioritizes the direct reduction of imported cases into New Mexico. While Mississippi has the highest *density* of infection, Arizona represents the largest *absolute number* of hidden infections entering New Mexico. By targeting Arizona, New Mexico maximizes its local benefit by intercepting the most significant source of undiagnosed carriers specific to its inbound traffic. This decision is based on New Mexico's specific exposure patterns, rather than solely focusing on the highest overall risk state, ensuring a tailored and effective defense against imported cases. Therefore, targeting Arizona is the most impactful policy for New Mexico in the upcoming two-week horizon."

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The decision to implement targeted inbound screening from New Mexico is based on a comprehensive risk assessment. While Arizona presents the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Pop of 0.0073, its baseline inbound flow to Texas is relatively low at 51,399. Mississippi also shows a high infectious density of 0.091, but its inbound flow is moderate at 29,421. New Mexico, despite having a lower infectious density of 0.00054 compared to Arizona and Mississippi, has the highest average daily inbound flow into Texas at 151,282. This significant volume of travelers, combined with a non-negligible infectious density, makes New Mexico a critical source for potential disease importation. By targeting New Mexico, we estimate capturing approximately 81 E and I individuals over the 14-day period (151,282 * 0.00054 * 0.90 * 14 days). This screening utility, though numerically smaller than what might be captured from Arizona or Mississippi if they had similar flow, is applied to the largest volume of incoming traffic, thereby mitigating the highest systemic risk of broad importation. This strategy focuses on containing the most impactful vector rather than just the most concentrated source, balancing detection utility with the scale of potential spread. This approach is a strategic choice to address the largest single source of inbound traffic, aiming to fill a potential gap in regional defense by focusing on a high-volume, moderate-risk state, rather than competing with other states that might target the highest-density but lower-volume sources like Arizona.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="After careful evaluation of potential origin states, Mississippi has been identified as the primary target for the Targeted Inbound Screening policy. While Texas presents the largest absolute inbound flow, its infectious density is relatively low. Conversely, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density with a significant proportion of its population being Exposed (E) or Infected (I). Specifically, Mississippi's infectious density is approximately 10.1percent, translating to an estimated 55,376 hidden infections (E+I). Implementing screening for Mississippi, with a 90percent detection rate, is projected to convert approximately 50,000 hidden infections from this origin into Confirmed (Q) status, thereby significantly reducing the number of undetected infectious individuals entering Virginia. This approach focuses on mitigating the highest-risk per-capita source, rather than solely the largest volume, ensuring a more effective reduction in the spread of the disease within Virginia. This decision balances the need to address high-risk populations with the practical constraint of targeting only one origin, aiming to maximize the utility of the screening intervention."

2025-12-24 20:12:59,587 - od_agent - INFO - Region arizona policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for travelers from mississippi is based on a comprehensive evaluation of source risk profiles and the potential utility of detection. mississippi exhibits an exceptionally high 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population) of approximately 10.28percent, which is significantly higher than any other origin state considered. This metric indicates a substantial proportion of hidden infections within its population. Despite its average daily inbound flow to arizona (2279 individuals) not being the highest, this elevated infectious density translates into the largest estimated number of 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) entering arizona daily, projected at approximately 234.20 individuals. The rigorous ninety percent screening mandate, or 'Q-Conversion,' for travelers from mississippi is estimated to effectively identify and isolate around 211 of these hidden infected individuals per day, moving them directly into the 'Confirmed (Q)' compartment upon arrival. This action is crucial as it prevents a significant number of actively infectious or soon-to-be infectious individuals from contributing to local transmission chains in arizona. This strategy represents a focused intervention on the most concentrated source of infectious risk, rather than solely targeting states with higher overall traffic volumes but lower infectious prevalence. By prioritizing mississippi, arizona aims to maximize the reduction of imported hidden infections, thereby directly minimizing future cumulative confirmed cases and deaths within the state."

2025-12-24 20:13:05,345 - od_agent - INFO - Region mississippi policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to target Texas for inbound screening is driven by a comprehensive assessment of source risk, detection utility, and strategic coordination. Texas presents the highest infectious density among all origin states, with a combined (E+I) population of 27219 and a total population of approximately 22.3 million, yielding an infectious density of 0.00122. More critically, Texas contributes the largest average daily inbound flow to Mississippi at 38,445 individuals, far exceeding other states. Implementing a 90percent screening policy on this flow is projected to convert a significant number of 'hidden infections' (E and I) into 'Q' status upon arrival. Given Texas's E+I count and its substantial inbound flow, approximately 27219 * (38445 / 22300000) = 47.0 E+I individuals are estimated to enter daily. A 90percent screening effectiveness would immediately identify and quarantine around 42 of these individuals per day, significantly mitigating the introduction of undetected infections into Mississippi. While Arizona also has a high E+I count, its inbound flow to Mississippi is comparatively low (2109), making the impact of screening less pronounced. This strategy prioritizes targeting the largest source of potential undetected infections directly linked to high mobility into Mississippi, thereby maximizing the reduction of imported cases and ultimately minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths, even if other states might also target Texas."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to target Texas for inbound screening is driven by a comprehensive assessment of risk and potential impact. While Arizona exhibits a high infectious density, Texas represents the most significant source of inbound traffic to New Mexico, with an average daily flow of 98,410 individuals. This large volume, combined with Texas's non-negligible infectious density of 0.0009, suggests a substantial importation risk. Implementing a 90percent screening mandate for Texas travelers is projected to convert approximately 152 hidden infections (E and I) into confirmed cases, thereby preventing their undetected spread within New Mexico. This strategy prioritizes targeting the largest inflow with a moderate risk profile, aiming to capture a significant absolute number of potential imported cases. By focusing on Texas, we address the primary conduit for disease importation, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths more effectively than targeting a state with a higher infectious density but significantly lower inbound flow, which might be targeted by other states. This approach fills a critical gap in regional defense by proactively managing the largest source of potential hidden infections."

 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="After careful evaluation, we recommend implementing a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for travelers arriving from New Mexico for the next two weeks. While New Mexico does not exhibit the highest raw number of Exposed (E) and Infected (I) individuals, its projected inbound flow to Texas is significantly higher than other states, making it a critical source of potential disease importation. The calculated Infectious Density (E+I)/Population for New Mexico is 0.000637. By screening New Mexico, we estimate capturing approximately 8,767 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) over the 14-day period, converting them to the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival. This strategy targets a high-volume corridor with a moderate risk profile, aiming to prevent a substantial number of undetected infectious individuals from integrating into the Texas population. This approach balances the need to mitigate risk from significant inbound traffic against the overall infectious density, providing a strategic intervention to reduce cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The decision to implement Targeted Inbound Screening on Texas is based on a comprehensive risk assessment. Texas presents the highest overall infectious density (0.00078) among all origin states, indicating a greater prevalence of hidden infections (E+I) within its population. More critically, Texas contributes the largest baseline inbound flow to Virginia (23381 daily travelers). By targeting Texas, we project to capture approximately 206 hidden infections (90percent of E+I) daily, which is significantly higher than any other state. For instance, while Mississippi has a higher infectious density, its inbound flow is much smaller (3551), leading to fewer projected captured infections (63). Arizona, despite its high population, has a lower infectious density and moderate flow, yielding only 61 captured infections. New Mexico poses the lowest risk due to its minimal infectious density and inbound flow. Therefore, prioritizing Texas allows Virginia to mitigate the largest potential source of imported cases, effectively reducing the influx of hidden infections and minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths, thereby strengthening our regional defense against disease spread.'

2025-12-24 20:13:44,084 - od_agent - INFO - Region arizona policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement targeted inbound screening for mississippi is based on a comprehensive risk assessment focusing on infectious density, potential hidden infections, and strategic impact. mississippi exhibits an exceptionally high infectious density, with approximately 12.95percent of its population being either Exposed (E) or Infected (I) (94762 E+I out of 731783 total population). This is significantly higher than other potential origin states, such as virginia (1.14percent), texas (0.17percent), and new mexico (0.08percent). Despite a relatively lower average daily inbound flow of 1918 travelers to arizona compared to states like texas or new mexico, mississippi's high infectious density means it contributes the highest number of hidden infections. Specifically, an estimated 248.33 individuals arriving daily from mississippi are likely to be E or I. Implementing a 90percent screening mandate for these travelers would effectively convert approximately 223.5 of these hidden infections into confirmed (Q) cases daily, thereby isolating them and preventing further community transmission within arizona. This intervention directly addresses the most potent source of hidden disease importation, prioritizing the state that poses the greatest per-traveler risk. By targeting this 'obvious' high-risk source, arizona maximizes the utility of its screening resources, minimizing the introduction of new infection chains and ultimately contributing most effectively to the reduction of cumulative confirmed cases and deaths within the state."

2025-12-24 20:13:50,037 - od_agent - INFO - Region mississippi policy response:
 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement targeted inbound screening on arizona is based on a multi-faceted risk assessment. Firstly, evaluating the 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population) for all potential origin states reveals that arizona presents the highest risk profile among the candidates. While its total population is large, the combined E and I counts are substantial. Secondly, the 'Detection Utility' calculation estimates the potential number of 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) that would be captured and converted to Q-status via a 90percent screening mandate. Arizona's average daily inbound flow, combined with its high E+I count, suggests that screening this state would yield the most significant reduction in unconfirmed infections entering mississippi, effectively preventing a substantial number of potentially infectious individuals from circulating. Specifically, arizona's inbound flow is 2086, and with an (E+I) count of 101241, 90percent screening would convert approximately 1800 E+I cases to Q per day for every 100,000 travelers. This is considerably higher than other states when considering both their infectious density and their inbound flow volume. Lastly, regarding 'Coordination vs. Competition,' by targeting arizona, we are addressing a clear high-risk source that, due to its geographic proximity and mobility patterns, is likely to be a significant contributor to imported cases. This proactive measure aims to bolster mississippi's internal disease control efforts by reducing the external infectious load, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths within the state."

2025-12-24 20:13:55,904 - od_agent - INFO - Region new mexico policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The decision to target Texas for inbound screening is driven by a comprehensive assessment of risk and potential impact. Firstly, Texas exhibits the highest absolute daily inbound flow into New Mexico by a significant margin (79,863 travelers), making it the largest conduit for potential disease importation. While its infectious density of 0.0017 is not the absolute highest among the options, the sheer volume of travelers means that even a moderate density translates into a substantial number of hidden infections. Specifically, with 37,204 E+I individuals, a 90percent screening on 79,863 daily travelers could intercept approximately 114 E+I individuals daily (0.0017 * 79863 * 0.9), effectively converting them to Q. This detection utility is critical for preventing a large influx of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carriers. Secondly, by selecting Texas, we are targeting the most impactful source of inbound traffic, aligning with a strategy of mitigating the largest systemic risk. This choice acknowledges that while other states like Mississippi have higher infectious densities, their much smaller inbound flows (1,137 daily) would yield a proportionally lower number of intercepted cases, making the intervention less impactful in terms of total burden reduction. This policy aims to pre-emptively identify and isolate a significant number of infected individuals, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Our analysis focuses on minimizing the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas by targeting the most impactful source of hidden infections. We first calculated the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each potential origin state. Mississippi presented the highest infectious density at approximately 19.3percent, significantly higher than Arizona (1.2percent), Virginia (1.2percent), and New Mexico (0.08percent). While New Mexico contributes the highest baseline inflow to Texas, its infectious density is very low, meaning fewer hidden infections would be captured. Conversely, Mississippi, despite having a lower absolute inflow compared to New Mexico, has a much higher proportion of exposed and infected individuals. Implementing a 90percent screening mandate on travelers from Mississippi is projected to capture approximately 87,000 hidden infections (E and I) over the 14-day period (90percent of (68388 E + 26374 I) * 28922 daily inflow / total population). This conversion of E and I to Q upon arrival prevents these individuals from spreading the disease undetected within Texas, thereby significantly reducing the potential for new infections and subsequent confirmed cases and deaths. This strategy prioritizes the capture of a high concentration of hidden infections, which poses a greater systemic risk to Texas than merely targeting the highest volume of travelers with a low infection rate. This targeted approach aims to fill a critical gap in regional defense by focusing on a source with a high internal disease burden.'

2025-12-24 20:14:22,079 - od_agent - INFO - Region virginia policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Virginia's policy for the next two weeks will focus on targeted inbound screening from mississippi. This decision is primarily driven by mississippi's significantly high infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, which stands at approximately 0.129. This is substantially higher than Virginia's own infectious density (0.0126) and that of other potential origin states, indicating a greater hidden prevalence of the disease within mississippi's population. Implementing a 90percent screening mandate for travelers from mississippi is estimated to capture approximately 413 hidden infections (E+I) daily, converting them to confirmed (Q) status upon arrival. This number far surpasses the estimated captures from any other state; for instance, arizona, with a higher total population, would yield only about 44 daily captures due to its lower infectious density, and texas, despite having the largest inbound flow, would only capture around 34. This strategy targets the most potent source of hidden infection importation, effectively mitigating the systemic risk of disease spread within Virginia. This approach is not about competing with other states for a 'shared' high-risk origin, but rather identifying and proactively addressing the most significant individual threat to Virginia's public health based on epidemiological data."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy on travelers from mississippi for the next two weeks is based on a comprehensive risk assessment focusing on infectious density and detection utility. Mississippi exhibits an exceptionally high 'Infectious Density' of approximately 0.1579 ((E+I)/Population), significantly higher than all other potential origin states. While its average daily inbound flow into Arizona is 1900, this high infectious density means a substantial proportion of these travelers are likely to be exposed or infected. By applying a 90percent screening mandate to inbound travelers from mississippi, an estimated 270 'Hidden Infections' (E and I individuals) per day will be effectively identified and moved into the 'Confirmed (Q)' compartment. This intervention is projected to convert approximately 3780 hidden infectious individuals to Q-status over the 14-day policy period, preventing them from contributing to undetected community transmission within Arizona. This strategy prioritizes the source with the highest inherent infection risk per traveler, even if the total inbound volume is not the highest, to maximize the reduction of imported disease burden and minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona. This choice targets a critical source of hidden infections, complementing any potential strategies other states might adopt based solely on high traffic volume."

2025-12-24 20:14:47,027 - od_agent - INFO - Region mississippi policy response:
 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The primary objective is to minimize the importation of hidden infections (E and I) into mississippi. We first calculate the infectious density ((E+I)/Population) for each potential origin state. Texas presents the highest infectious density at approximately 0.0018, followed by arizona at 0.0014, virginia at 0.0015, and new mexico at 0.000001. While arizona and virginia have higher E+I counts, texas has a significantly larger average daily inbound flow into mississippi (35622 travelers), dwarfing the inflows from other states. Therefore, a targeted screening policy on texas is expected to capture the most hidden infections. With a 90percent screening effectiveness, this policy could prevent approximately 107 E and I individuals from entering mississippi undetected daily, thereby reducing the seeding of new infections and subsequent confirmed cases and deaths. This strategy targets the most significant source of potential importation based on both prevalence and mobility, providing the greatest utility in reducing the hidden infectious population entering mississippi.'

2025-12-24 20:15:04,286 - od_agent - INFO - Region new mexico policy response:
 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis focuses on minimizing new mexico's cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by intercepting hidden infections (Exposed and Infected individuals) at the border. We evaluated the infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, for all potential origin states. Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density at approximately 0.1579, indicating a significant proportion of its population is currently infectious. However, its average daily inbound flow into new mexico is minimal, at only 1129 travelers, translating to an estimated 178 hidden infections daily. In contrast, while Arizona's infectious density is lower at 0.0136, its substantial average daily inbound flow of 28775 travelers means it contributes an estimated 392 hidden infections to new mexico daily. Texas, despite having the highest inbound flow of 73550, has a very low infectious density of 0.0018, resulting in only about 129 hidden infections daily. Virginia presents both a moderate density (0.0129) and a very low inflow (1710), contributing only 22 hidden infections. To maximize the detection utility and convert the largest number of hidden infections to Q-status upon arrival, we recommend implementing a targeted inbound screening policy on Arizona. This policy is projected to convert approximately 353 E and I individuals from Arizona into the Confirmed (Q) compartment daily, preventing their potential spread within new mexico. This strategy prioritizes the absolute volume of intercepted hidden infections directly impacting new mexico, making it the most effective immediate measure to safeguard our state's public health, rather than targeting a state with high density but low direct contribution to new mexico's infectious burden."

2025-12-24 20:15:09,314 - od_agent - INFO - Region texas policy response:
 policy={'new mexico': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="After careful evaluation of potential origin states, 'new mexico' has been selected for targeted inbound screening. The primary rationale is based on its high Infectious Density, despite a lower absolute number of E+I individuals compared to some other states. Specifically, new mexico has an (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.00115 (11121 / 9701650), which is higher than arizona (0.00014) and virginia (0.00004). While mississippi has a much higher density, its baseline inflow into texas is significantly lower. Focusing on new mexico allows for a substantial capture of 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) due to its high daily inbound flow of 129,254 travelers into texas. With a 90percent screening effectiveness, this policy is estimated to convert approximately 129 new E+I cases into Q-status daily (129254 * 0.00115 * 0.9), preventing these individuals from spreading the disease undetected within texas. This strategy balances the risk of importation with the volume of incoming traffic, aiming to proactively mitigate disease spread by converting a significant number of potentially infectious individuals into the confirmed and isolated compartment (Q). This is a strategic choice to target a high-volume, high-density source that might be overlooked if only absolute E+I numbers were considered, thus complementing potential interventions by other states."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The recommendation is to implement targeted inbound screening for travelers arriving from mississippi for the next 14 days. This decision is driven by a comprehensive risk assessment focusing on infectious density, detection utility, and the overall impact on Virginia's epidemic trajectory. Mississippi exhibits an exceptionally high infectious density of approximately 0.158 ((E+I)/Population), significantly surpassing all other potential origin states. This high density implies a substantially greater proportion of exposed and infected individuals within their general population, posing a significant risk of importation. While Texas has a higher total inbound flow to Virginia, the critical factor is the very high infectious density of mississippi, which translates to an estimated 502 hidden infections (E+I) entering Virginia daily from mississippi. Implementing a 90percent screening mandate for mississippi would effectively identify and convert approximately 452 of these hidden infections into confirmed (Q) cases upon arrival each day. This proactive measure drastically reduces the influx of undetected carriers, thereby limiting potential community transmission within Virginia. This strategy targets the most obvious and impactful high-risk source, ensuring that Virginia's resources are focused on intercepting the largest volume of hidden infections. While other states like Arizona also present a notable risk, the sheer scale of potential hidden infections from mississippi makes it the paramount target for intervention, thus minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to target Mississippi for enhanced inbound screening is based on a multi-faceted risk assessment. Firstly, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density among all origin states, with an (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 1.84percent (82559+33906 / 417491), significantly higher than New Mexico (0.13percent), Texas (0.25percent), or Virginia (1.65percent). This high density indicates a greater likelihood of infected individuals traveling from Mississippi. Secondly, despite having a lower absolute inflow compared to Texas or New Mexico, the detection utility is substantial due to this high infectious density. With an average daily inflow of 2184, and a 90percent screening effectiveness, we estimate to capture approximately 226 hidden infections (0.9 * (82559+33906)/417491 * 2184) daily, converting them to Q status and preventing further community spread within Arizona. While Texas has a much larger inflow, its infectious density is considerably lower, meaning the absolute number of hidden infections captured per unit of inflow would be less impactful relative to the overall risk from Mississippi. New Mexico also has a high inflow but very low infectious density. This strategy prioritizes targeting a state with a concentrated burden of infection, even if its overall traffic volume is not the highest, to maximize the impact of the screening intervention on reducing hidden disease importation. This approach avoids simply targeting the largest inflow and instead focuses on the most 'infectious' inflow, thereby optimizing resource allocation for disease control."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="New Mexico's policy for the next two weeks will implement targeted inbound screening on travelers from Texas. This decision is driven by a comprehensive assessment of source risk profiles and detection utility. Texas, with an infectious density of approximately 0.0024 ((17677 E + 29340 I) / 18862606 Total Population), presents a moderate risk, but its significantly high inbound flow into New Mexico (79862 daily) makes it a critical vector for disease importation. While Mississippi has a higher infectious density (0.136), its inbound flow to New Mexico is comparatively negligible (1008 daily). Arizona also has a lower infectious density (0.018) and a much lower inbound flow (12798 daily). By targeting Texas, we estimate a substantial number of hidden infections (E and I) will be captured and converted to Q-status. With a 90percent screening mandate, approximately 38 (E+I) individuals from Texas's daily flow (79862 * 0.0024 * 0.9) would be identified and isolated, significantly reducing the hidden infectious population entering New Mexico. This strategy balances the need to mitigate high-volume importation risks with the objective of minimizing cumulative cases and deaths. This choice reflects a coordination strategy to address the most impactful inbound vector, even if other states have higher individual infectious densities, because the sheer volume from Texas presents the greatest aggregate risk. This intervention is designed to effectively reduce the overall disease burden by intercepting a significant number of potentially infectious individuals before they can spread the virus within our community."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis focuses on minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths within texas by strategically targeting inbound traffic. The 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population) for each potential origin state was calculated to assess the source risk profile: arizona (1.81percent), mississippi (27.27percent), new mexico (0.13percent), and virginia (1.52percent). Mississippi clearly stands out with a significantly higher infectious density. Targeting mississippi for screening offers the highest detection utility, as an estimated 116,465 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) could be identified and converted to Q-status for every 100,000 travelers from mississippi, based on its high E+I population proportion. This intervention is crucial for reducing the hidden infectious population entering texas, thereby mitigating the risk of widespread community transmission. While other states like arizona and virginia also have notable infectious populations, their densities are considerably lower, and the inbound flow from mississippi, though not the highest in absolute terms, carries a disproportionately high risk due to its internal epidemic situation. This strategy represents a targeted approach, focusing on the most potent source of potential disease importation rather than a diffuse effort across multiple, less critical origins. We are specifically addressing the most significant individual threat to texas, rather than attempting to compete for a more 'obvious' but less impactful target, thus optimizing our limited intervention capacity."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Our analysis for the upcoming 14-day horizon identifies mississippi as the most critical origin state for targeted inbound screening into virginia. Evaluating the Source Risk Profile, mississippi exhibits a significantly higher infectious density of approximately 0.1517 (E+I)/Population compared to other potential origin states. This high density directly translates to a substantial number of 'Hidden Infections' entering virginia. Specifically, with an average daily inbound flow of 4148 travelers from mississippi, an estimated 629 individuals per day are likely to be in the Exposed or Infected stages. Implementing a ninety percent screening mandate on travelers from mississippi provides substantial Detection Utility, projecting that approximately 566 hidden infections will be identified and moved directly into the Confirmed (Q) compartment daily. This proactive measure prevents these individuals from silently contributing to community spread within virginia. Regarding Coordination vs. Competition, mississippi stands out as the 'obvious' high-risk state based on quantitative metrics. Prioritizing screening for travelers from mississippi ensures that virginia is addressing the most impactful source of disease importation, effectively reducing the hidden infectious population and consequently minimizing future cumulative confirmed cases and deaths within our state. This focused intervention maximizes our public health resources by targeting the highest-yield source of potential new infections."
