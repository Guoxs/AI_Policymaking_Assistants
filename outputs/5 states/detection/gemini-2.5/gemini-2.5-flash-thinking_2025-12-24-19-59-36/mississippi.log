To identify the most impactful intervention, we first assessed the 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population) for each potential origin state. Virginia presented the highest infectious density at approximately 0.00195, followed by Arizona at 0.00158, Texas at 0.00019, and New Mexico at 0.00022. While Virginia exhibits the highest concentration of hidden infections, the overall risk also depends on the volume of travelers. Texas, despite having a lower infectious density compared to Virginia and Arizona, contributes the largest average daily inbound flow into Mississippi (60,331 travelers). This high volume, when combined with its infectious density, results in the highest estimated number of daily 'hidden' infections (E and I) entering Mississippi from any single state, approximately 11.2 individuals. Consequently, implementing a 90% screening mandate for travelers from Texas is projected to capture and convert approximately 10.08 'hidden' infections (E and I) into confirmed (Q) cases daily. Over the 14-day policy period, this amounts to over 141 individuals, significantly reducing the potential for community transmission from imported cases. This targeted approach prioritizes the highest absolute number of potentially infectious individuals entering Mississippi, rather than solely focusing on the state with the highest infection rate, thereby maximizing the utility of the screening intervention to safeguard our population. This strategy addresses a high-volume source that, if left unchecked, would significantly contribute to the local epidemic curve."

Firstly, evaluating the source risk profile, arizona exhibits the highest infectious density among all potential origin states, with a combined (E+I)/Population of approximately 0.0020. This indicates a significant proportion of its population is either exposed or actively infected, posing a substantial risk of disease importation to mississippi.

Secondly, the detection utility of screening arizona travelers is estimated to be considerable. With an average of 16743 (E+I) individuals, and a 90% screening effectiveness, we anticipate converting approximately 15069 hidden infections to Q-status upon arrival over the 14-day period. This proactive measure significantly reduces the influx of unconfirmed infectious individuals into mississippi, thereby mitigating local transmission risk. Lastly, concerning coordination versus competition, while other states might also target high-risk origins, our focus on arizona is justified by its high infectious density coupled with its substantial inbound flow to mississippi. This strategic selection aims to intercept a critical pathway for disease introduction, complementing broader regional efforts by addressing a specific, high-impact vector for our state.

While Virginia has a higher individual infectious density, its lower inbound flow results in fewer total hidden infections captured (around 4.7 daily). The objective is to prevent the largest absolute number of hidden infections from entering and spreading within Mississippi. Third, concerning Coordination vs. Competition, targeting Texas is a strategic choice. While other states might also target high-volume origins, Mississippi's immediate priority is to mitigate the largest single source of potential importation.

  "global_guidance": "The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy on travelers from Virginia is based on a comprehensive risk assessment focusing on minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi. First, evaluating the 'Source Risk Profile' by calculating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for all potential origin states revealed Virginia as the highest-risk state with an infectious density of approximately 0.00468, followed by Arizona (0.00372), Texas (0.00054), and New Mexico (0.00041). This indicates a more active and widespread hidden infection within Virginia's population. Second, assessing the 'Detection Utility,' we estimated the number of 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) that would be captured and converted to Q-status daily through a 90% screening mandate. Despite its moderate inbound flow of 5593 travelers, Virginia contributes an estimated 26.19 E+I individuals daily, leading to approximately 23.57 captures. This figure is marginally higher than Texas, which, despite its significantly larger inbound flow of 47740, contributes about 25.62 E+I individuals daily, resulting in 23.06 captures due to its much lower infectious density. Therefore, targeting Virginia offers the highest immediate impact in preventing the introduction of hidden infections into Mississippi. Finally, regarding 'Coordination vs. Competition,' while Virginia might be considered an 'obvious' high-risk choice due to its high infectious density, this policy directly addresses the most potent source of imported infections for Mississippi. Prioritizing the state that presents both a high per-capita risk and the largest absolute number of capturable hidden infections ensures the most effective use of screening resources for our state's protection, directly supporting the objective of minimizing local disease burden."

  "global_guidance": "The decision to implement targeted inbound screening on arizona is based on a multi-faceted risk assessment. Firstly, evaluating the 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population) for all potential origin states reveals that arizona presents the highest risk profile among the candidates. While its total population is large, the combined E and I counts are substantial. Secondly, the 'Detection Utility' calculation estimates the potential number of 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) that would be captured and converted to Q-status via a 90% screening mandate. Arizona's average daily inbound flow, combined with its high E+I count, suggests that screening this state would yield the most significant reduction in unconfirmed infections entering mississippi, effectively preventing a substantial number of potentially infectious individuals from circulating. Specifically, arizona's inbound flow is 2086, and with an (E+I) count of 101241, 90% screening would convert approximately 1800 E+I cases to Q per day for every 100,000 travelers. This is considerably higher than other states when considering both their infectious density and their inbound flow volume. Lastly, regarding 'Coordination vs. Competition,' by targeting arizona, we are addressing a clear high-risk source that, due to its geographic proximity and mobility patterns, is likely to be a significant contributor to imported cases. This proactive measure aims to bolster mississippi's internal disease control efforts by reducing the external infectious load, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths within the state."

  "global_guidance": "The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for travelers from Texas is based on a comprehensive evaluation of source risk profiles and the potential utility of detection. While Arizona exhibits the highest infectious density (0.01688) among the candidate states, Texas presents the most significant overall risk due to its exceptionally high average daily inbound flow into Mississippi (47,560 travelers). Despite Texas having a lower infectious density (0.00235) compared to Arizona and Virginia, the sheer volume of travelers means that approximately 111.76 individuals with hidden infections (E+I) are estimated to enter Mississippi daily from Texas. With a 90% screening mandate, this policy is projected to effectively detect and convert around 100.58 hidden infections into confirmed (Q) cases daily. This is substantially higher than the 28.75 detections from Arizona or 58.24 from Virginia, representing the greatest opportunity to reduce the "hidden" infectious population entering Mississippi. This strategy prioritizes the absolute reduction of imported infections, directly minimizing the potential for community transmission and subsequent confirmed cases and deaths within Mississippi, even if other states might also identify Texas as a high-flow, high-impact source."
