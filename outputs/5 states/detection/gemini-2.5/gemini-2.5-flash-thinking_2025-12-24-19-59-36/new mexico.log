Mississippi presents the highest infectious density among all potential origin states, with a combined (E+I)/Population ratio of 0.0127. This indicates a significantly larger proportion of hidden infections compared to other states like Arizona (0.0012), Texas (0.0001), or Virginia (0.0015). While Texas contributes the highest baseline inbound flow, its infectious density is remarkably low, suggesting that screening its travelers would yield fewer captured infections despite the volume. Conversely, Mississippi's high infectious density means that the 90% screening mandate will convert a substantial number of 'E' and 'I' individuals directly into the 'Q' compartment upon arrival. This strategy prioritizes the detection and isolation of hidden infections from the most concentrated source, effectively reducing the introduction of undetected carriers into New Mexico's susceptible population. This targeted approach focuses on the most impactful source of potential disease importation, aiming to minimize future confirmed cases and deaths by preventing onward transmission from these high-risk, initially asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carriers. This choice allows New Mexico to address a critical importation risk without over-resourcing for states with lower infectious densities, ensuring efficient resource allocation and maximizing the utility of the screening intervention."

Our analysis of source risk profiles reveals that Mississippi currently has the highest infectious density at 5.25% ((35374 E + 17309 I) / 1000000 population-scaled), significantly higher than Texas (0.05%), Arizona (0.37%), and Virginia (0.49%). While Mississippi's average daily inbound flow into New Mexico (1134) is not the highest, its extremely high infectious density means that a substantial number of hidden infections (E and I) would be captured and converted to Q-status upon arrival. Specifically, screening 90% of these 1134 travelers would effectively detect and isolate approximately 53 (0.9 * 1134 * 0.0525) infected individuals who might otherwise contribute to local spread. This intervention focuses on a clear, high-risk source, preventing significant disease importation, and complementing potential actions by other states which might target larger, but less dense, traffic corridors.

  "global_guidance": "The primary objective is to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico by mitigating the risk of disease importation. To achieve this, we evaluated potential origin states based on their infectious density, the volume of inbound travelers to New Mexico, and the potential number of hidden infections (E and I) that could be detected and isolated. For the source risk profile, we calculated the infectious density ((E+I)/Population) for all potential origin states. Mississippi exhibited the highest infectious density at approximately 0.075, followed by Virginia (0.0084), Arizona (0.0071), and Texas (0.0007). While Mississippi has the highest density, its average daily inbound flow to New Mexico is comparatively low (1,497 travelers). Conversely, Texas has the lowest infectious density but the highest inbound flow (99,222 travelers). Arizona presents a moderate infectious density but a substantial inbound flow (32,596 travelers). For detection utility, to maximize the impact of a targeted screening policy, we focused on identifying the state that would yield the highest number of detected hidden infections (E and I) converted to the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival. By multiplying each state's infectious density by its average daily inbound flow to New Mexico, we estimated the daily average of E and I travelers entering New Mexico. Arizona was projected to contribute approximately 233 E and I individuals daily, Mississippi 113, Texas 71, and Virginia 17. Implementing a 90% screening mandate would therefore convert roughly 210 E/I individuals from Arizona to Q status daily, significantly more than any other state. This direct conversion prevents these individuals from silently spreading the disease within New Mexico's community. Regarding coordination versus competition, our strategy prioritizes the direct reduction of imported cases into New Mexico. While Mississippi has the highest *density* of infection, Arizona represents the largest *absolute number* of hidden infections entering New Mexico. By targeting Arizona, New Mexico maximizes its local benefit by intercepting the most significant source of undiagnosed carriers specific to its inbound traffic. This decision is based on New Mexico's specific exposure patterns, rather than solely focusing on the highest overall risk state, ensuring a tailored and effective defense against imported cases. Therefore, targeting Arizona is the most impactful policy for New Mexico in the upcoming two-week horizon."

  "global_guidance": "The decision to target Texas for inbound screening is driven by a comprehensive assessment of risk and potential impact. Firstly, Texas exhibits the highest absolute daily inbound flow into New Mexico by a significant margin (79,863 travelers), making it the largest conduit for potential disease importation. While its infectious density of 0.0017 is not the absolute highest among the options, the sheer volume of travelers means that even a moderate density translates into a substantial number of hidden infections. Specifically, with 37,204 E+I individuals, a 90% screening on 79,863 daily travelers could intercept approximately 114 E+I individuals daily (0.0017 * 79863 * 0.9), effectively converting them to Q. This detection utility is critical for preventing a large influx of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carriers. Secondly, by selecting Texas, we are targeting the most impactful source of inbound traffic, aligning with a strategy of mitigating the largest systemic risk. This choice acknowledges that while other states like Mississippi have higher infectious densities, their much smaller inbound flows (1,137 daily) would yield a proportionally lower number of intercepted cases, making the intervention less impactful in terms of total burden reduction. This policy aims to pre-emptively identify and isolate a significant number of infected individuals, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico."

  "global_guidance": "Our analysis focuses on minimizing new mexico's cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by intercepting hidden infections (Exposed and Infected individuals) at the border. We evaluated the infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, for all potential origin states. Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density at approximately 0.1579, indicating a significant proportion of its population is currently infectious. However, its average daily inbound flow into new mexico is minimal, at only 1129 travelers, translating to an estimated 178 hidden infections daily. In contrast, while Arizona's infectious density is lower at 0.0136, its substantial average daily inbound flow of 28775 travelers means it contributes an estimated 392 hidden infections to new mexico daily. Texas, despite having the highest inbound flow of 73550, has a very low infectious density of 0.0018, resulting in only about 129 hidden infections daily. Virginia presents both a moderate density (0.0129) and a very low inflow (1710), contributing only 22 hidden infections. To maximize the detection utility and convert the largest number of hidden infections to Q-status upon arrival, we recommend implementing a targeted inbound screening policy on Arizona. This policy is projected to convert approximately 353 E and I individuals from Arizona into the Confirmed (Q) compartment daily, preventing their potential spread within new mexico. This strategy prioritizes the absolute volume of intercepted hidden infections directly impacting new mexico, making it the most effective immediate measure to safeguard our state's public health, rather than targeting a state with high density but low direct contribution to new mexico's infectious burden."

  "global_guidance": "New Mexico's policy for the next two weeks will implement targeted inbound screening on travelers from Texas. This decision is driven by a comprehensive assessment of source risk profiles and detection utility. Texas, with an infectious density of approximately 0.0024 ((17677 E + 29340 I) / 18862606 Total Population), presents a moderate risk, but its significantly high inbound flow into New Mexico (79862 daily) makes it a critical vector for disease importation. While Mississippi has a higher infectious density (0.136), its inbound flow to New Mexico is comparatively negligible (1008 daily). Arizona also has a lower infectious density (0.018) and a much lower inbound flow (12798 daily). By targeting Texas, we estimate a substantial number of hidden infections (E and I) will be captured and converted to Q-status. With a 90% screening mandate, approximately 38 (E+I) individuals from Texas's daily flow (79862 * 0.0024 * 0.9) would be identified and isolated, significantly reducing the hidden infectious population entering New Mexico. This strategy balances the need to mitigate high-volume importation risks with the objective of minimizing cumulative cases and deaths. This choice reflects a coordination strategy to address the most impactful inbound vector, even if other states have higher individual infectious densities, because the sheer volume from Texas presents the greatest aggregate risk. This intervention is designed to effectively reduce the overall disease burden by intercepting a significant number of potentially infectious individuals before they can spread the virus within our community."
