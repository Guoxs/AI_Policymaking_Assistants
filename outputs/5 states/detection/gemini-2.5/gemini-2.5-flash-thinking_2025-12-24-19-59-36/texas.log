New Mexico presents the highest infectious density among all evaluated origin states at approximately 0.00099769 ((E+I)/Population). More critically, New Mexico also has the highest average daily inbound flow into Texas, with 84,217 travelers per day. This combination results in the largest number of 'hidden infections' (E and I individuals) entering Texas from any single origin state, estimated at 84.01 individuals daily. By implementing a 90% screening mandate, we project to convert approximately 75.61 E and I individuals from New Mexico into Q-status daily. This significantly higher detection utility, compared to other states (e.g., Mississippi at 14.86, Arizona at 10.05, Virginia at 7.28), makes New Mexico the optimal choice for intervention. Targeting this state directly addresses the most significant source of potential disease importation, effectively reducing the hidden infectious population within Texas and thereby minimizing future cumulative confirmed cases and deaths.

Mississippi presents the highest Source Risk Profile, with an infectious density (E+I)/Population of approximately 1.24%, significantly exceeding that of Arizona (0.13%), Virginia (0.15%), and New Mexico (0.02%). This high density, combined with its average daily inbound flow into Texas, translates to an estimated 494 hidden infections (E and I) arriving daily from Mississippi. The Detection Utility of this intervention is substantial: a 90% screening mandate for travelers from Mississippi would effectively capture and move approximately 444 infectious individuals into the Confirmed (Q) compartment each day. This is a far greater number than what could be captured from any other single origin state, making it the most impactful intervention to prevent undetected disease spread within Texas. This strategy prioritizes the most significant and quantifiable risk, ensuring that Texas's resources are directed towards mitigating the largest source of potential disease importation.

While New Mexico has a lower infectious density, its inbound flow is also considerably lower. Arizona and Virginia have lower infectious densities than Mississippi, making them less critical targets for immediate intervention. By focusing on Mississippi, we estimate capturing approximately 388 hidden infections (E+I) per day that would otherwise enter Texas undetected. This strategic interception aims to convert these individuals to the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival, thereby preventing further community transmission within Texas. This approach targets the most potent source of potential disease importation, optimizing the utility of our screening efforts to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths, even if it means not targeting a state with the absolute highest raw number of E+I, but rather the highest risk per capita from a significant inbound source.'

  "global_guidance": "After careful evaluation of potential origin states, 'new mexico' has been selected for targeted inbound screening. The primary rationale is based on its high Infectious Density, despite a lower absolute number of E+I individuals compared to some other states. Specifically, new mexico has an (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 0.00115 (11121 / 9701650), which is higher than arizona (0.00014) and virginia (0.00004). While mississippi has a much higher density, its baseline inflow into texas is significantly lower. Focusing on new mexico allows for a substantial capture of 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) due to its high daily inbound flow of 129,254 travelers into texas. With a 90% screening effectiveness, this policy is estimated to convert approximately 129 new E+I cases into Q-status daily (129254 * 0.00115 * 0.9), preventing these individuals from spreading the disease undetected within texas. This strategy balances the risk of importation with the volume of incoming traffic, aiming to proactively mitigate disease spread by converting a significant number of potentially infectious individuals into the confirmed and isolated compartment (Q). This is a strategic choice to target a high-volume, high-density source that might be overlooked if only absolute E+I numbers were considered, thus complementing potential interventions by other states."

  "global_guidance": "Our analysis focuses on minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths within texas by strategically targeting inbound traffic. The 'Infectious Density' ((E+I)/Population) for each potential origin state was calculated to assess the source risk profile: arizona (1.81%), mississippi (27.27%), new mexico (0.13%), and virginia (1.52%). Mississippi clearly stands out with a significantly higher infectious density. Targeting mississippi for screening offers the highest detection utility, as an estimated 116,465 'Hidden Infections' (E+I) could be identified and converted to Q-status for every 100,000 travelers from mississippi, based on its high E+I population proportion. This intervention is crucial for reducing the hidden infectious population entering texas, thereby mitigating the risk of widespread community transmission. While other states like arizona and virginia also have notable infectious populations, their densities are considerably lower, and the inbound flow from mississippi, though not the highest in absolute terms, carries a disproportionately high risk due to its internal epidemic situation. This strategy represents a targeted approach, focusing on the most potent source of potential disease importation rather than a diffuse effort across multiple, less critical origins. We are specifically addressing the most significant individual threat to texas, rather than attempting to compete for a more 'obvious' but less impactful target, thus optimizing our limited intervention capacity."
