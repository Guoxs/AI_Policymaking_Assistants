  "global_guidance": "The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for New Mexico is based on a comprehensive evaluation of source risk and detection utility. New Mexico presents the highest immediate risk of importing hidden infections into Arizona, primarily due to a significant daily inbound flow of approximately 14,511 travelers. While its infectious density, calculated at approximately 0.0009977 ((E+I)/Population), is not the absolute highest among the candidate states, the sheer volume of travel amplifies its impact. This combination means an estimated 14.475 hidden infections (individuals in the Exposed or Infected compartments) are entering Arizona from New Mexico daily. Implementing a 90% screening mandate for New Mexico is projected to be highly effective, converting approximately 13.03 of these individuals directly into the Confirmed (Q) compartment each day. Over the 14-day policy horizon, this intervention is expected to identify and isolate roughly 182 hidden cases, significantly reducing their potential to spread the disease within Arizona. This targeted approach maximizes the utility of Arizona's screening capacity by focusing on the origin state contributing the most hidden E and I cases via direct travel, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona. This strategy is a direct response to the most impactful source of hidden infections for Arizona, rather than competing for states with higher overall infectious densities but lower direct inbound flow."

This indicates a higher proportion of potentially infectious individuals within its general population. Furthermore, despite having a lower absolute inbound flow compared to texas or new mexico, the high infectious density of mississippi means that a targeted screening policy will yield a substantial detection utility. By implementing a 90% screening mandate, we estimate that approximately 289 hidden infections (E+I) from mississippi will be identified and converted to Q-status upon arrival in arizona over the next 14 days, preventing their unmonitored spread within our community. This strategy prioritizes the state with the highest per-capita risk, effectively intercepting a significant number of infectious individuals who would otherwise contribute to local transmission chains. While other states have higher absolute inbound flows, their much lower infectious densities make them less impactful targets for this specific type of screening intervention.

  "global_guidance": "Arizona's policy for the next two weeks will focus on targeted inbound screening from Mississippi. This decision is based on a multi-faceted risk assessment. Firstly, Mississippi presents the highest infectious density among all potential origin states, with a combined (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 6.2% (35374 E + 17309 I / 840090 S + ...). This significantly surpasses other states like Virginia (0.48%), Texas (0.05%), and New Mexico (0.04%). This high density suggests a greater probability of infected or exposed individuals entering Arizona from Mississippi. Secondly, the detection utility of screening Mississippi travelers is substantial. With an average daily inbound flow of 1831 individuals, and a 90% screening mandate, we estimate capturing approximately 87 'hidden infections' (E+I) per day (1831 * 0.062 * 0.90). This conversion of E and I to Q upon arrival prevents these individuals from silently spreading the disease within Arizona's susceptible population. While Texas has a higher absolute inflow, its significantly lower infectious density makes screening less impactful in terms of hidden infection capture per traveler. Lastly, regarding coordination vs. competition, Mississippi's high infectious density makes it an obvious high-risk target. By screening, Arizona proactively mitigates a significant external threat, potentially complementing broader regional efforts without necessarily overlapping with other states that might target larger, but less densely infected, origins. This focused intervention aims to minimize disease importation and subsequent local transmission, thereby reducing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona."

  "global_guidance": "The decision to implement targeted inbound screening for mississippi is based on a comprehensive risk assessment focusing on infectious density, potential hidden infections, and strategic impact. mississippi exhibits an exceptionally high infectious density, with approximately 12.95% of its population being either Exposed (E) or Infected (I) (94762 E+I out of 731783 total population). This is significantly higher than other potential origin states, such as virginia (1.14%), texas (0.17%), and new mexico (0.08%). Despite a relatively lower average daily inbound flow of 1918 travelers to arizona compared to states like texas or new mexico, mississippi's high infectious density means it contributes the highest number of hidden infections. Specifically, an estimated 248.33 individuals arriving daily from mississippi are likely to be E or I. Implementing a 90% screening mandate for these travelers would effectively convert approximately 223.5 of these hidden infections into confirmed (Q) cases daily, thereby isolating them and preventing further community transmission within arizona. This intervention directly addresses the most potent source of hidden disease importation, prioritizing the state that poses the greatest per-traveler risk. By targeting this 'obvious' high-risk source, arizona maximizes the utility of its screening resources, minimizing the introduction of new infection chains and ultimately contributing most effectively to the reduction of cumulative confirmed cases and deaths within the state."

  "global_guidance": "The decision to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy on travelers from mississippi for the next two weeks is based on a comprehensive risk assessment focusing on infectious density and detection utility. Mississippi exhibits an exceptionally high 'Infectious Density' of approximately 0.1579 ((E+I)/Population), significantly higher than all other potential origin states. While its average daily inbound flow into Arizona is 1900, this high infectious density means a substantial proportion of these travelers are likely to be exposed or infected. By applying a 90% screening mandate to inbound travelers from mississippi, an estimated 270 'Hidden Infections' (E and I individuals) per day will be effectively identified and moved into the 'Confirmed (Q)' compartment. This intervention is projected to convert approximately 3780 hidden infectious individuals to Q-status over the 14-day policy period, preventing them from contributing to undetected community transmission within Arizona. This strategy prioritizes the source with the highest inherent infection risk per traveler, even if the total inbound volume is not the highest, to maximize the reduction of imported disease burden and minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona. This choice targets a critical source of hidden infections, complementing any potential strategies other states might adopt based solely on high traffic volume."

  "global_guidance": "The decision to target Mississippi for enhanced inbound screening is based on a multi-faceted risk assessment. Firstly, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density among all origin states, with an (E+I)/Population ratio of approximately 1.84% (82559+33906 / 417491), significantly higher than New Mexico (0.13%), Texas (0.25%), or Virginia (1.65%). This high density indicates a greater likelihood of infected individuals traveling from Mississippi. Secondly, despite having a lower absolute inflow compared to Texas or New Mexico, the detection utility is substantial due to this high infectious density. With an average daily inflow of 2184, and a 90% screening effectiveness, we estimate to capture approximately 226 hidden infections (0.9 * (82559+33906)/417491 * 2184) daily, converting them to Q status and preventing further community spread within Arizona. While Texas has a much larger inflow, its infectious density is considerably lower, meaning the absolute number of hidden infections captured per unit of inflow would be less impactful relative to the overall risk from Mississippi. New Mexico also has a high inflow but very low infectious density. This strategy prioritizes targeting a state with a concentrated burden of infection, even if its overall traffic volume is not the highest, to maximize the impact of the screening intervention on reducing hidden disease importation. This approach avoids simply targeting the largest inflow and instead focuses on the most 'infectious' inflow, thereby optimizing resource allocation for disease control."
