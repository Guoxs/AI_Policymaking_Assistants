By enforcing a rigorous ninety percent screening mandate on inbound travelers from Arizona, a significant number of hidden infections from the exposed and infected compartments can be detected and moved directly to the confirmed compartment. This proactive approach not only reduces the risk of disease spread within New Mexico but also contributes to overall regional defense by targeting a key hotspot. By focusing on Arizona, New Mexico can effectively coordinate with neighboring states to mitigate the importation of infections, ultimately minimizing the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in the state.'
