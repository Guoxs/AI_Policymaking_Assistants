Mississippi's infectious density is an order of magnitude greater than others, indicating a highly concentrated infectious risk despite its smaller population size. Although Mississippi's average inbound flow into New Mexico is low (1137 daily), the screening mandate's utility is maximized by capturing a large proportion of hidden infections (E and I) due to its high infectious density. Screening 90% of incoming travelers from Mississippi will significantly reduce the importation of hidden infections that would otherwise seed new cases in New Mexico. Targeting Mississippi is a strategic move that complements likely broader screening efforts focused on larger states like Arizona or Texas by other jurisdictions, thus filling a regional defense gap against a high-risk source that might otherwise be overlooked. This focused approach balances risk reduction with operational feasibility and avoids overextending screening resources on states with much lower infectious densities. Therefore, imposing targeted inbound screening on Mississippi optimally reduces cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks."

Despite its much smaller inbound flow into New Mexico (~1129 daily) compared to Texas (~73550) and Arizona (~28775), the high infectious density means that even a small number of incoming travelers can introduce a disproportionately high number of hidden infections. By targeting Mississippi for rigorous 90% screening, we can effectively convert a large portion of exposed and infected travelers into confirmed cases (Q), substantially reducing the hidden infectious pool entering New Mexico. This strategy focuses on a secondary source of risk rather than the obvious large-volume states, filling a critical gap in regional defense and complementing probable screening efforts by other states on major sources like Texas and Arizona. Texas, although having the highest inbound flow, has a very low infectious density, reducing the marginal benefit of screening there. Arizona and Virginia have moderate infectious densities but much higher volumes, yet their infection rates are less severe than Mississippi¡¯s per capita risk. Hence, prioritizing Mississippi balances detection utility and risk mitigation by capturing high-risk travelers from a smaller but more infectious source, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks."

This is substantially higher than the infectious densities of Arizona (~0.017%), Texas (~0.0017%), and Virginia (~0.0042%). Despite Mississippi's relatively low average daily inbound flow into New Mexico (about 1008), the high infectious density means that each traveler from Mississippi has a significantly higher probability of being exposed or infected.

This targeted approach balances risk and operational feasibility by focusing on a key secondary source of infection rather than the larger but less dense flows from Arizona or Texas, which may already be monitored or targeted by other jurisdictions.
