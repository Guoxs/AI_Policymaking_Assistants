 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='In assessing inbound traffic risks to Arizona, Virginia presents the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population approximately 0.00058, much greater than Mississippi (0.00088), New Mexico (0.001), and Texas (0.00004). Although New Mexico has a slightly higher infectious density (~0.001), Virginia¡¯s absolute numbers of exposed and infected individuals (1825 E and 3189 I) combined with a substantial inbound flow (3171 daily travelers) pose a significant threat of importing hidden infections. Targeting Virginia for the 90percent screening mandate will likely intercept a larger absolute number of hidden infectious travelers and reduce the seeding of new cases in Arizona. Screening would convert approximately 90percent of the exposed and infected travelers from Virginia into confirmed cases upon arrival, effectively diminishing the silent community spread potential. While Texas has the largest daily inflow (22661) and is an obvious high-volume source, its lower infectious density and smaller E+I counts reduce the per-traveler risk. New Mexico, despite higher flow and infection density, is smaller in absolute infectious counts. Coordinating with other states potentially focusing on Texas or New Mexico, prioritizing Virginia fills a niche in regional defense by addressing a moderate flow but high infection-load source, thereby optimizing risk reduction under the single-state screening policy constraint. No restrictions on other states preserve mobility while focusing resources on the highest-impact source, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona over the next 14 days.'

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Virginia has the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population = (1825+3189)/11423959 ¡Ö 0.000445, which is significantly higher than Arizona (~0.0000405), New Mexico (~0.0010 but with much lower inflow), and Texas (~0.000043). Despite Texas having the largest absolute inflow into Mississippi (24412 daily), its infectious density is relatively low due to its large population and comparatively lower E+I values. Virginia, with a moderate inflow of 2260 daily travelers, presents a disproportionately higher risk of importing hidden infections. The targeted inbound screening policy on Virginia travelers will identify and convert approximately 90percent of exposed and infected individuals arriving from Virginia into confirmed cases (Q), effectively reducing the hidden infectious load entering Mississippi. This focused intervention on Virginia is a strategic choice that complements other states' efforts, as Virginia's infectious risk is not as obviously addressed compared to larger states like Texas or Arizona, which might be targeted by other regions. Such coordination fills a critical gap in regional epidemic defense while minimizing disruption to larger traffic flows from lower-risk origins. Thus, implementing rigorous screening on inbound travelers from Virginia optimally balances epidemic control efficacy with mobility considerations over the next two-week horizon."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Virginia exhibits the highest Infectious Density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, with 5014 infectious individuals over a population around 8,524,995, resulting in approximately 0.000588, which is notably higher than Arizona (0.000395), Mississippi (0.000906), and Texas (0.000043). Virginia's daily inbound flow into New Mexico, though smaller than Texas and Arizona, is still significant at 1385 travelers per day. Targeting Virginia for the 90percent screening mandate will capture and convert a substantial portion of hidden infections (E and I) into confirmed cases (Q), effectively reducing undetected infectious arrivals and limiting local transmission risk. Although Texas has the largest inbound flow, its Infectious Density is comparatively low, reducing the marginal benefit of screening there. Arizona has a high volume but a lower Infectious Density than Virginia, and Mississippi has both lower Infectious Density and inbound flow. Prioritizing Virginia fills a critical regional defense gap by addressing a high-risk source with moderate flow, balancing resource allocation for maximum impact. This targeted approach minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico more effectively than no intervention or selecting other states, optimizing epidemic control within mobility constraints."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Virginia has the highest infectious density calculated as (E+I)/Population = (1825+3189)/8524995 ¡Ö 0.000593, which is notably higher than Arizona (0.000384), Mississippi (0.000881), and New Mexico (0.00103). Although New Mexico's density is slightly higher than Virginia's, Virginia's inbound flow to Texas is substantially large (13780 daily), making its total importation risk significant. Screening travelers from Virginia will therefore capture a meaningful number of hidden infections given the 90percent detection efficiency; specifically, approximately 90percent of the exposed and infected among the 13780 daily travelers will be identified and quarantined, dramatically lowering the risk of new community transmissions. Arizona, despite having a very large inbound flow (27907), has a lower infectious density, reducing the relative risk. Mississippi's inbound flow is smaller (18479) with moderate infectious density, and New Mexico, while having a smaller population and slightly higher density, has a much larger inflow (84217) but a lower absolute number of infected individuals proportionally. Prioritizing Virginia targets a source with high infection prevalence and notable mobility into Texas, filling a regional defense gap. This approach balances detection utility and importation risk, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Texas more effectively than screening from other states. Hence, the recommended policy is targeted inbound screening for Virginia travelers for the next 14 days."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density, Mississippi has a notably high ratio of (E+I) to population compared to other origins: (906+1753)/2970629 ¡Ö 0.00089, which is higher than Arizona (~0.00039), New Mexico (~0.00102), and Texas (~0.00004). Despite New Mexico's slightly higher infectious density (~0.00102), its inbound flow to Virginia is very low (1004 daily), limiting its importation risk. Mississippi's daily inbound flow to Virginia is 2401, which combined with its significant infectious density, makes it a substantial hidden infection risk. Enforcing targeted inbound screening on Mississippi can convert 90percent of E and I travelers into the Q compartment, sharply reducing the hidden infectious population entering Virginia and thus lowering secondary transmission. Arizona and Texas, although having larger populations, have lower infectious densities and/or higher inbound flows that dilute the risk per traveler, making Mississippi a more impactful focus. This targeted approach fills a gap in regional defense by addressing a secondary but significant importation source that may be overlooked by other states focusing on larger but less infectious origins. Hence, selecting Mississippi for the screening mandate optimally balances detection utility and systemic risk reduction to minimize cumulative cases and deaths over the next 14 days."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the four origin states (Mississippi, New Mexico, Texas, Virginia), Mississippi has the highest infectious density calculated as (E+I)/Population = (3320+1783)/5486976 ¡Ö 0.00093, which is notably higher than New Mexico (~0.00036), Texas (~0.00007), and Virginia (~0.00059). This elevated infectious density indicates a greater hidden infection risk per capita among travelers from Mississippi. Combined with a moderate daily inbound flow to Arizona of 1524 travelers, Mississippi represents a significant source of potential infectious importation into Arizona. By imposing a targeted inbound screening policy on Mississippi, 90percent of exposed and infected travelers can be detected and moved directly to the confirmed (Q) compartment, substantially reducing the number of hidden infections entering the community. Although Texas has the highest inbound volume (27201), its lower infectious density dilutes the overall risk per traveler. Virginia and New Mexico have lower combined risk profiles due to either lower infectious density or smaller flows. Targeting Mississippi fills a strategic gap in regional defense by addressing a high-risk but less obvious source, complementing potential interventions from other agents who might target larger volume states like Texas. This focused approach balances the systemic risk of disease importation and effectively minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona over the next two weeks.'

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Virginia shows the highest infectious density calculated as (E+I)/Population = (4043+983)/~13,300,000 ¡Ö 0.00038, higher than Arizona (~0.00004), New Mexico (~0.00036), and Texas (~0.00007). Although Texas has the largest inflow to Mississippi (~31,103 daily), its infectious density is much lower than Virginia's. Virginia's daily inflow to Mississippi is moderate (~3,005), but due to its relatively high infectious density, even this moderate flow introduces a significant number of hidden infections daily. Implementing a targeted inbound screening at Mississippi's border for travelers from Virginia will identify and quarantine 90percent of exposed and infected travelers, substantially reducing the hidden infectious pool entering Mississippi. This intervention captures more undetected infections proportionally than screening higher-volume but lower-risk states like Texas or Arizona. Choosing Virginia fills a regional defense gap as other states may focus on larger states with higher flow like Texas, thus avoiding competition. This targeted screening will effectively reduce new introductions of infection, thereby lowering cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next two weeks. Hence, restricting inbound traffic from Virginia with rigorous screening balances risk reduction and resource focus optimally."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density defined as (E+I)/Population for each origin state, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density. Specifically, Mississippi's infectious count (E=3320, I=1783) over a population of approximately 7,512,525 yields an infectious density of roughly 0.068percent. In contrast, Arizona's infectious density is about 0.041percent, Texas about 0.007percent, and Virginia roughly 0.058percent. Despite having a relatively low inbound flow to New Mexico (1230 daily), Mississippi's infection prevalence is significantly higher than the others, indicating a concentrated risk of introducing hidden infectious cases. Implementing a 90percent screening mandate targeting inbound travelers from Mississippi will efficiently identify and isolate a substantial portion of these hidden cases (E and I), thereby mitigating their impact on New Mexico's epidemic burden. This targeted approach addresses a secondary high-risk source state that might be overlooked by other agents focusing on higher volume but lower-risk states like Texas or Arizona, thereby enhancing regional defense against imported infections. Given the relatively low inbound volume from Mississippi, the screening intervention is operationally feasible and likely to yield a disproportionate reduction in imported infections, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals that Mississippi poses the highest risk. Mississippi has (E+I)=5103 and population approximately 2925416, resulting in an infectious density of about 0.001744, significantly higher than Arizona (~0.00042), New Mexico (~0.00036), and Virginia (~0.00058). The inbound flow from Mississippi to Texas is also substantial at 24,904 daily travelers, which means a high number of potential hidden infections could be introduced. Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy on Mississippi travelers would identify and quarantine approximately 90percent of these hidden infectious individuals (E and I), substantially reducing undetected importation and subsequent community spread. While Arizona and Virginia have large total populations and inbound flows, their infectious densities are lower, and New Mexico, despite a high flow (117,318), has a much lower infectious density. Targeting Mississippi fills a critical gap in regional defense by addressing a high-risk source that might be overlooked if only the highest volume states were considered. This approach balances coordination and competition by focusing on a high-risk but less obvious source, maximizing the impact of screening within the constraint of selecting only one origin state. Thus, restricting inbound travelers from Mississippi with rigorous screening is optimal to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Texas over the next 14 days.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density calculated as (E+I)/Population, with (3320+1783)/2925416 ¡Ö 0.00177, significantly exceeding that of Arizona (~0.00043), New Mexico (~0.00036), and Texas (~0.00007). Despite its smaller inbound flow into Virginia (3440 daily), Mississippi's elevated hidden infection prevalence (E+I=5103) represents a disproportionately high risk of introducing new infections. Implementing targeted screening at the Virginia border for travelers from Mississippi will convert 90percent of these hidden infections to confirmed cases upon arrival, effectively removing approximately 4593 potential new infectious individuals from community transmission chains. This intervention is expected to substantially reduce undetected seeding infections and subsequent local spread. Although Texas has the highest absolute inbound flow (15325 daily), its infectious density is much lower, making Mississippi the more critical source to target. Arizona and New Mexico have lower infectious densities and fewer inbound travelers. Prioritizing Mississippi fills a regional defense gap by addressing a high-risk secondary source rather than competing for the obvious high-volume but lower-risk Texas flow. This focused approach optimizes resource use and epidemic control impact, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density when considering the sum of exposed (E=5702) and infected (I=2647) relative to its total population (~8,106,417), yielding an infectious density of approximately 0.00105. Texas and Virginia have lower infectious densities (~0.00009 and ~0.00076 respectively), and New Mexico has the lowest (~0.00029). Mississippi's average daily inbound flow to Arizona is moderate (1474 travelers/day), which means that a significant number of potentially infectious individuals could enter Arizona from Mississippi daily. By implementing a Targeted Inbound Screening policy on Mississippi arrivals, we can capture and convert 90percent of these hidden infections (E and I) into confirmed (Q) cases upon entry, effectively reducing untracked infectious spread inside Arizona. This screening can significantly mitigate the importation risk from this high-risk source. Although Texas has a much larger flow into Arizona (28967/day), its infectious density is much lower, so the absolute number of infected travelers might be less impactful per capita. Targeting Mississippi fills a critical gap by addressing a smaller but substantially riskier source, complementing other regional efforts and potentially avoiding redundancy in screening already targeted high-volume but lower-infectious-density states. Therefore, restricting and rigorously screening travelers from Mississippi optimizes resources to reduce cumulative infections and deaths in Arizona over the upcoming two weeks."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement inbound screening targeting Virginia is based on a comprehensive assessment of infection risk and mobility patterns. Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density among the origin states, calculated as (E+I)/Population, approximately 0.000747, reflecting a relatively elevated hidden infectious population capable of seeding cases in Mississippi. Despite Texas having a substantial inbound flow (32,701 daily) compared to Virginia's 2,877, the infectious density in Texas is significantly lower (~0.000096), diminishing the relative risk per traveler. By targeting Virginia, the policy captures a more concentrated source of hidden infections given the 90percent screening efficacy converting exposed and infected travelers into confirmed cases (Q), thereby reducing the silent importation of infections into Mississippi. This focused approach prioritizes a high-risk source that might be under-addressed by other states due to Virginia's medium-sized travel volume but higher infection prevalence, enhancing regional epidemic control through complementary rather than redundant screening. Arizona¡¯s and New Mexico¡¯s infectious densities and inbound flows are considerably lower, making them less critical targets. Overall, selecting Virginia aligns with minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi by maximizing detection utility relative to traveler volume while strategically filling a gap in coordinated regional defense against imported infections."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, with (5702+2647)/approx 11.2 million total population (sum of compartments), significantly higher than Arizona, Texas, and Virginia. Mississippi's infectious density is about 0.0076, whereas others are lower (Arizona ~0.00044, Texas ~0.00009, Virginia ~0.00076). Despite having a lower inbound flow into New Mexico (1233 daily), the high proportion of hidden infections (E+I) means that even a small number of arrivals can disproportionately contribute to new cases. Implementing a 90percent screening policy on inbound travelers from Mississippi would effectively convert the majority of these hidden infections to confirmed cases upon arrival, significantly reducing the undetected infectious individuals entering New Mexico, thus minimizing secondary transmission and cumulative cases. While Texas supplies the largest inflow (75115 daily) and has substantial infections, its infectious density is much lower, so the marginal benefit of screening is less significant compared to Mississippi. Arizona and Virginia have moderate infectious densities but higher or comparable flows, yet their risk is diluted due to larger populations and lower infectious densities. Targeting Mississippi represents a strategic decision to fill a regional defense gap by focusing on a smaller but high-risk source that might be overlooked if only high-volume states were targeted. This targeted approach balances detection utility and resource allocation to effectively reduce importation risk and cumulative disease burden in New Mexico over the next 14-day horizon."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Assessing the origin states relative to Texas, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, with approximately (5702+2647)/2849810 ¡Ö 0.00295, which is substantially greater than Arizona (~0.00056), New Mexico (~0.00029), and Virginia (~0.00075). This high infectious density means travelers from Mississippi pose the greatest risk of importing hidden infections into Texas. The inbound flow from Mississippi is moderate (26190 daily), so targeting this state for enhanced screening can effectively intercept a significant number of exposed and infected individuals. Applying a 90percent screening mandate at the border for Mississippi arrivals would convert a large fraction of these hidden cases into confirmed (Q), thereby reducing undetected spread within Texas. While Arizona and Virginia have larger inbound flows, their infectious densities are lower, making their relative risk per traveler less. New Mexico has a high flow but very low infectious density, so screening there yields less benefit. By focusing on Mississippi, Texas strategically fills a regional defense gap by controlling a secondary yet highly risky source that may be underprioritized by other states. This targeted approach balances detection utility, resource allocation, and systemic risk reduction to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths over the next two weeks.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density ((E+I)/Population) of each origin state reveals that Mississippi poses the highest relative risk. Mississippi has E=5702 and I=2647 on a population of approximately 8,759,226 (sum of given compartments), yielding an infectious density of about 0.00095, which is significantly higher than Arizona (~0.00044), New Mexico (~0.00029), and Texas (~0.00009). Despite Mississippi's lower average daily inbound flow into Virginia (~3303) compared to Texas (15964) and Arizona (3673), its high infectious density means each traveler has a higher chance of being in the exposed or infected state. Implementing a targeted inbound screening on Mississippi travelers would convert ninety percent of these hidden infections (E and I) into confirmed cases upon entry, effectively removing a substantial number of potential spreaders from the community. This targeted approach fills a strategic gap in regional defense by focusing on a high-risk but lower-volume source, rather than the obvious high-volume but lower-risk Texas or Arizona. This balances resources and maximizes detection utility, reducing Virginia's cumulative confirmed cases and deaths more effectively than screening larger but less infectious sources. Therefore, restricting and screening inbound travelers from Mississippi for 14 days is the optimal policy to minimize systemic disease importation risk."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Mississippi presents the highest infectious density among the origin states when considering (E+I)/Population: approximately (9367+4433)/~15,217,657 ~0.00088, which is significantly higher than New Mexico (~0.00024), Texas (~0.00012), and Virginia (~0.00095 but with much lower inflow). Arizona's own infectious density is approximately (6893+441)/7,870,596 ~0.00091, so Mississippi poses a comparable and concerning import risk. The daily inbound flow from Mississippi to Arizona is 1596, which, while smaller than New Mexico and Texas, is still substantial and enough to represent a meaningful importation risk. Implementing targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi can capture roughly 90percent of the exposed and infected individuals among these 1596 daily arrivals, significantly reducing the hidden infectious population entering Arizona. This focused intervention addresses a high-risk yet potentially under-targeted source compared to Texas, whose very large flow but lower infectious density dilutes risk, and New Mexico, which has higher flow but lower infectious density. Virginia's infectious density is close but inbound flow is comparatively small. Thus, screening Mississippi travelers fills an important regional defense gap by targeting a highly infectious origin with moderate flow, rather than competing with potentially overlapping efforts on Texas or New Mexico. This strategy minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona effectively by reducing imported hidden infections from a key infectious state without overextending resources."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the origin states, Virginia presents the highest infectious density calculated as (E+I)/Population, with approximately (6539+1528)/8530674 ¡Ö 0.00095, which is notably higher than Texas (0.00015), Arizona (0.00008), and New Mexico (0.00024). Despite the daily inbound flow from Virginia to Mississippi being lower (3671) compared to Texas (38622), the higher infectious density means Virginia travelers pose a relatively higher risk of importing hidden infections (E and I). Implementing rigorous 90 percent screening on inbound travelers from Virginia will effectively convert a large fraction of these hidden infections into confirmed cases, thus significantly reducing the risk of undetected infectious individuals entering Mississippi. Targeting Virginia focuses resources on a high-risk but less obvious source compared to the much larger flow from Texas, thereby complementing regional efforts that might prioritize larger volume states. This targeted approach balances the trade-off between volume and infection risk, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Mississippi by addressing a critical gap in inbound risk without overextending screening resources on lower-risk or extremely high-volume but lower prevalence origins.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, reveals that Mississippi has the highest density among the origin states, with (9367+4433)/approximately 15,000,000 yielding roughly 0.000893 or 0.0893percent. Arizona's density is about (5635+358)/approximately 8,000,000 = 0.000749 or 0.0749percent, Virginia's is (6539+1528)/approximately 10,000,000 = 0.000806 or 0.0806percent, and Texas has the lowest infectious density at (1270+1970)/approximately 29,000,000 = 0.00011 or 0.011percent. Despite Texas having the highest absolute inbound flow into New Mexico (about 84,392 daily), its infectious density is considerably lower, meaning fewer infectious individuals per capita among travelers. Mississippi's inbound flow to New Mexico is relatively low (1241 daily), but because of its high infectious density, the proportion of infected travelers is significant. Implementing targeted screening on Mississippi arrivals can capture and convert 90percent of exposed and infected individuals into confirmed cases upon entry, effectively isolating these hidden infections and reducing community transmission. While Arizona and Virginia also have notable infectious densities, their inbound flows are either lower or their densities are slightly less than Mississippi's. Targeting Mississippi complements broader regional defenses by addressing a secondary but high-risk source that might be overlooked by others focusing on higher volume but lower risk states like Texas. This strategy balances detection utility and systemic risk mitigation by focusing on a critical vulnerability in the inbound traffic network, thereby minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next 14 days."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the four origin states, Mississippi presents the highest infectious density with a combined exposed and infected population of 13,800 out of approximately 28,347 total population segments (S+E+I+Q+R+D), resulting in a notably elevated (E+I)/Population ratio compared to Arizona, New Mexico, and Virginia. Mississippi¡¯s inbound flow into Texas is moderately high at 30,835 daily travelers, creating a significant risk vector for importing hidden infections. The rigorous ninety percent screening policy for inbound travelers from Mississippi would effectively identify and quarantine the majority of exposed and infected individuals before they can contribute to community transmission within Texas, thereby substantially reducing hidden infectious seeds entering the state. Although Arizona and Virginia have large populations and high absolute numbers, their infectious densities are lower, and New Mexico¡¯s inflow is high but risk per traveler is low. Targeting Mississippi balances risk reduction and resource allocation by focusing on a high-risk, moderate-flow source that might be overlooked by other regional policies focused on larger states. This strategic selection complements broader regional epidemic control efforts by filling a gap in defense against imported cases, optimizing Texas¡¯s public health outcomes without overextending screening capacity. Therefore, implementing targeted inbound screening for travelers from Mississippi is the most effective measure to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths over the next 14 days.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="In evaluating the risk each origin state poses for introducing hidden infections into Virginia, I calculated the infectious density defined as (E+I)/Population. Mississippi has a notably high infectious density (~0.0057) compared to Arizona (~0.00078), New Mexico (~0.00024), and Texas (~0.00012). Despite having a smaller inflow volume to Virginia (3307 daily), Mississippi's elevated infectious density means a significant proportion of inbound travelers could be exposed or infected. The expected number of hidden infections arriving daily from Mississippi is approximately 136 (E+I of 13800 multiplied by inflow proportion), and rigorous 90percent screening could convert roughly 122 of these cases from hidden to confirmed upon arrival, greatly reducing community exposure risk. Arizona, while having a larger inflow, has a lower infectious density, resulting in fewer hidden infected travelers entering Virginia. Texas and New Mexico have lower infectious densities and higher populations, but their infectious burden is spread thinner, with fewer hidden infections proportional to inflow. Targeting Mississippi fills a critical gap in regional disease control by addressing a secondary but high-risk source often overlooked due to its smaller inflow, thus complementing broader multi-state efforts. This targeted screening policy balances epidemiological impact with operational feasibility, maximizing the reduction in imported cases and helping minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the four origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population approximately equal to (14227+6772)/6282009 ¡Ö 0.0033, which is markedly higher than New Mexico (~0.00023), Texas (~0.00014), and Virginia (~0.0012). This indicates Mississippi poses the greatest risk in terms of hidden infectious individuals potentially entering Arizona. The daily inbound flow from Mississippi into Arizona is moderate at 1899 travelers, which means screening here can effectively reduce a concentrated source of infection. Applying a 90percent screening mandate to this flow would identify and isolate a substantial portion of exposed and infected travelers, directly reducing the hidden infectious influx and lowering subsequent community transmission within Arizona. While Texas and New Mexico have much higher inbound flows, their infectious densities are significantly lower, reducing the marginal benefit of screening them first. Virginia, though higher in infectious density than Texas and New Mexico, has a smaller inbound flow than Texas and a lower infectious density than Mississippi, making it a less optimal target. Targeting Mississippi aligns with a strategy to fill a gap in regional defense by focusing on a high-risk, moderately trafficked origin, potentially overlooked by others who might prioritize Texas due to volume. This focused intervention on Mississippi is expected to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona more effectively over the 14-day horizon.'

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Evaluating the infectious density, which is (E+I)/Population, for each origin state reveals the relative importation risk to Mississippi. Arizona has (7482+477)/16,452,135 ¡Ö 0.00047, New Mexico (794+171)/4,140,563 ¡Ö 0.00023, Texas (1497+2342)/33,103,570 ¡Ö 0.00011, and Virginia (8210+1918)/9,516,769 ¡Ö 0.00107. Virginia shows the highest infectious density, but its inbound flow to Mississippi is relatively low (4364), while Texas has a high inbound flow of 47,996 daily, creating a substantial absolute number of potential hidden infections entering Mississippi. Screening travelers from Texas, with a rigorous 90percent detection converting exposed and infected individuals directly to confirmed cases, will significantly reduce the number of hidden infectious arrivals, thus lowering community transmission risk. Although Virginia has a higher infectious density, the smaller flow limits its overall impact. Arizona and New Mexico have moderate infectious densities but much smaller flows into Mississippi. Targeting Texas aligns with strategic defense against the largest volume of potentially infectious travelers, addressing a critical gap in regional containment. This choice balances detection utility and systemic risk reduction more effectively than focusing solely on the state with the highest density. Therefore, imposing targeted inbound screening on travelers from Texas for the next 14 days is the optimal policy to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement targeted inbound screening from Mississippi is based on a detailed assessment of infectious density, detection utility, and strategic coordination. Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density among origin states, with (E+I)/Population approximately 0.0081 (20999 infectious out of ~25.7 million), far exceeding Arizona (~0.00097), Texas (~0.00014), and Virginia (~0.00117). Although Mississippi's average daily inbound flow into New Mexico is relatively low at 1,324 travelers, the high infectious density means that even this smaller volume poses a substantial risk of introducing hidden infections. By enforcing rigorous 90percent screening on inbound travelers from Mississippi, we can capture and convert a significant portion of these hidden E and I cases into confirmed Q status before community exposure, effectively cutting off a critical importation pathway. Targeting Mississippi, rather than the more obvious high-volume but lower infectious density states like Texas or Arizona, addresses a strategic gap in regional defense that may be overlooked by other agents focusing on larger flows. This complementary approach reduces overall importation risk more efficiently by focusing on the highest infection prevalence source despite lower travel volume, thus minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, where E=14227 and I=6772 over a population approximately 25,697,776, resulting in an infectious density of roughly 0.81 per 1000 individuals. This is significantly higher than Arizona, New Mexico, and Virginia, whose infectious densities are much lower. Despite Mississippi's lower inbound flow into Texas (37,780 daily) compared to Arizona and New Mexico, the relatively high infectious density combined with a moderate flow suggests a meaningful contribution of exposed and infected individuals entering Texas. Implementing a targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi would enable rigorous detection and conversion of 90percent of hidden infections (E and I) into confirmed cases (Q) upon arrival, thereby reducing the untracked infectious population that could propagate transmission within Texas. The expected detection utility is considerable given the high numbers of E and I in Mississippi's population, and the inbound flow volume is sufficient to warrant intervention without being the largest flow that might strain resources. The choice to target Mississippi represents a strategic complement to other states that may focus on high flow but lower infectious densities, filling a gap in regional defense by addressing a high-risk source with moderate mobility. This targeted screening policy balances detection efficiency and resource allocation, aiming to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Texas over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals that Mississippi has the highest infectious density, with (14227+6772)/2569776 ¡Ö 0.0082, significantly higher than Arizona (7959/7917354 ¡Ö 0.0010), New Mexico (965/4137827 ¡Ö 0.00023), and Texas (3839/26458470 ¡Ö 0.00015). Despite Mississippi's lower absolute inbound flow to Virginia (4177 daily), the high infectious density means each traveler poses a greater risk of introducing hidden infections. Implementing targeted inbound screening on Mississippi travelers will capture approximately 90percent of exposed and infected individuals entering Virginia from this source, effectively converting a substantial portion of hidden cases into confirmed (Q) and reducing community spread. Screening Arizona or Texas, though having higher inflow volumes, yields lower marginal detection benefits due to their lower infectious densities. New Mexico also has low infectious density and smaller inflows, offering minimal impact. Prioritizing Mississippi addresses a critical gap in regional defense by targeting a high-risk but less obvious source, complementing possible broader policies other states might implement on larger states like Texas. This focused approach optimizes resource use and maximizes reduction in imported infections, thereby minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, among the origin states reveals that Mississippi poses the highest risk. Mississippi has a combined exposed and infected population of 30430 (E=20617, I=9813) out of approximately 24 million (sum of all compartments roughly 24 million), yielding a significantly higher infectious density compared to Texas, Virginia, and New Mexico. While Texas and Virginia have larger populations, their infectious densities are notably lower. Furthermore, the daily inflow from Mississippi into Arizona is moderate (2382), which makes targeting this origin state manageable and effective. The detection utility is substantial: screening 90percent of inbound travelers from Mississippi can intercept a large number of hidden infections (E+I), thereby directly reducing the number of infectious individuals entering Arizona undetected. This intervention is also strategically complementary, as other states might focus on larger volume states like Texas or New Mexico, whereas Mississippi's high infectious density combined with moderate flow presents a critical gap in regional defense. Prioritizing Mississippi for targeted inbound screening is expected to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona over the next two weeks by markedly reducing the importation of hidden infections from a high-risk source."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the origin states, Virginia presents the highest infectious density calculated as (E+I)/Population, with approximately 12,722 infectious individuals out of a population near 96.1 million, yielding a noticeably higher infection rate compared to Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Virginia also contributes a moderate average daily inbound flow of 4702 travelers into Mississippi, a significant enough volume to impact local transmission dynamics. The targeted screening policy at the Mississippi border for travelers from Virginia would allow rigorous identification and quarantine of roughly 90percent of the exposed and infected individuals entering the state, substantially reducing hidden infections and preventing further local spread. While Texas has the highest inflow of 52,561 travelers, its infectious density is lower, and Arizona and New Mexico have lower inflows and infectious densities. Choosing Virginia balances risk mitigation by addressing a high-risk source with moderate travel volume, filling a regional defense gap rather than competing with likely policies targeting Texas or Arizona. This focused intervention will minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by intercepting a disproportionately high infectious population entering Mississippi from Virginia, making it the optimal single-state inbound screening target for the next 14 days.'

2025-12-24 19:52:37,394 - od_agent - INFO - Region new mexico policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals that Mississippi has a significantly higher infectious density compared to others: approximately 30,430 infectious individuals out of 2,406,045 total (E+I), yielding a ratio around 0.0126, which is substantially higher than Arizona (~0.0008), Texas (~0.00017), and Virginia (~0.0016). Although Texas contributes the largest inbound flow into New Mexico (115,020 daily), its infectious density is relatively low, diminishing the overall risk per traveler. Mississippi's lower inbound flow (1,425 daily) combined with its high infectious density means a higher proportion of infected travelers arrive from there. Implementing rigorous 90percent screening for inbound travelers from Mississippi would effectively identify and isolate a significant number of exposed and infected individuals, reducing hidden transmission risks. This targeted approach complements broader regional efforts focused on high-volume states like Texas and Arizona, filling a critical gap in New Mexico's border defense by focusing on a comparatively smaller but higher-risk source. Therefore, selecting Mississippi for targeted inbound screening maximizes detection utility and minimizes overall community transmission and deaths in New Mexico over the next 14 days."

2025-12-24 19:52:40,918 - od_agent - INFO - Region texas policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the origin states, Mississippi presents the highest infectious density calculated as (E+I)/Population. Specifically, Mississippi has E=20617 and I=9813 out of a population sum of approximately 2390232+20617+9813+5462+15128+655, yielding an infectious density significantly higher than Arizona, New Mexico, and Virginia. The daily inbound flow from Mississippi to Texas is moderate at 39,776 travelers, which is large enough to pose a substantial importation risk but not so large as to overwhelm screening capacity. Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy on Mississippi travelers would identify and convert approximately 90percent of hidden infections (E and I) entering Texas from this state, effectively reducing the seeding of new cases and deaths in Texas. Arizona and Virginia have higher or comparable absolute numbers of E and I but also substantially larger populations and inbound flows, making targeted screening less efficient or potentially logistically challenging. New Mexico has a lower infectious density and smaller inbound flow. Choosing Mississippi balances high relative infection prevalence with manageable flow, filling a regional defense gap that might be overlooked if focusing only on the largest or most obvious sources like Arizona or Virginia. This targeted approach provides a strategic intervention minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas over the next two weeks.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states considered, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population = (20617+9813)/2390232 ¡Ö 0.0121, which is significantly above the densities of Arizona (¡Ö0.0008), New Mexico (¡Ö0.00024), and Texas (¡Ö0.00017). Although Mississippi's inbound flow into Virginia is moderate at approximately 4198 daily travelers, the relatively high infectious density means a notable number of hidden infections (E and I) are likely entering Virginia daily. Implementing targeted inbound screening on Mississippi travelers would convert 90percent of these hidden infections into confirmed cases (Q) upon arrival, effectively reducing the undetected infectious population entering Virginia. This targeted approach prioritizes blocking the primary high-risk source rather than the higher-volume but lower-risk states like Texas and Arizona. Such a policy complements regional defense by focusing on a high-risk state that might be under-targeted by others focusing on more populous states, thus maximizing detection utility and reducing cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals that Mississippi has the highest infectious density and thus represents the greatest risk of importing hidden infections into Arizona. Specifically, Mississippi's combined exposed and infected population is 41064 out of approximately 2.15 million, yielding an infectious density of about 1.91percent, which is significantly higher than those of New Mexico (~0.025percent), Texas (~0.02percent), and Virginia (~0.02percent). Moreover, Mississippi's average daily inbound flow into Arizona is 2601, which, while smaller than Texas and New Mexico, still represents a non-negligible pathway for disease importation. By targeting Mississippi with a rigorous ninety percent inbound screening, Arizona can effectively identify and quarantine a large portion of the hidden infections (E and I) arriving from that state, thereby substantially reducing the importation of infectious individuals. Although Texas and New Mexico contribute higher absolute inbound flows, their lower infectious densities imply fewer hidden infections per traveler. The policy balances resource allocation by focusing on the most infectious origin, filling a critical gap in regional defense. This targeted approach complements likely measures other states may impose on Texas or New Mexico, and by focusing on Mississippi, Arizona can reduce cumulative cases and deaths more effectively over the next two weeks without incurring the systemic costs and complexities of multi-state screening."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, shows that Virginia has the highest infectious density among the origin states, approximately 0.00173, compared to Arizona (0.00153), New Mexico (0.00025), and Texas (0.00021). Despite Texas having the largest inbound flow volume into Mississippi (60,331 daily), its infectious density is relatively low, making the absolute number of infectious travelers less concerning than Virginia's. Virginia's moderate inflow (5,376 daily) combined with the highest infectious density results in a significant risk of importing hidden infections. Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy on Virginia travelers will identify and quarantine 90percent of exposed and infected individuals entering Mississippi from Virginia, substantially reducing the hidden infectious pool and mitigating local transmission. This approach prioritizes a high-risk source state with a balanced inflow rather than simply focusing on the largest inflow source, effectively filling a regional defense gap. Arizona and New Mexico have lower inflows and/or infectious densities, making their impact less critical to target. Texas, though high in volume, has a low infectious density, so screening there is less efficient. Therefore, targeting Virginia offers the best trade-off between detection utility and risk reduction to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="In assessing the risk from each origin state to New Mexico, the infectious density (E+I)/Population is a critical metric. Mississippi exhibits a notably high infectious density: (E=27809 + I=13255) over a population of approximately 21,194,444, yielding about 0.00194. This is significantly higher than Arizona (~0.00153), Virginia (~0.00172), and Texas (~0.0002). Although Texas has the largest absolute inbound flow into New Mexico (132,778 daily), its infectious density is lowest, reducing the relative risk. Mississippi's inbound flow is modest (1,605 daily), but given the high infectious density, even this small flow poses an outsized importation risk. Implementing Targeted Inbound Screening on travelers from Mississippi can identify and quarantine 90percent of exposed and infected individuals at the border, effectively reducing hidden infectious importation. This intervention addresses a high-risk yet less obvious source, complementing potential broader regional strategies focusing on larger states like Texas or Arizona. By targeting Mississippi, New Mexico fills a critical gap, mitigating systemic risk from a concentrated outbreak source while not overextending resources on lower-risk origins. Thus, prioritizing Mississippi balances detection utility and risk minimization for the next 14 days."

2025-12-24 19:53:05,027 - od_agent - INFO - Region texas policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, with 27809 exposed and 13255 infected over a relatively small population of approximately 42,646,000 (sum of compartments), resulting in a significantly higher proportion of hidden infections compared to Arizona, New Mexico, and Virginia. Additionally, Mississippi's average daily inbound flow into Texas is substantial at 37,844, providing a meaningful channel for disease importation. Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy on travelers from Mississippi will convert approximately 90percent of the hidden infections (E and I) entering Texas into confirmed cases (Q), effectively isolating these individuals and reducing community transmission risk. Although Arizona and Virginia have large absolute numbers of E and I, their infectious density is lower, and their inbound flows are either too high (Arizona) or less critical when balanced with infection risk (Virginia). New Mexico shows the lowest infectious density and thus lower importation risk. The decision to target Mississippi reflects a strategic approach to fill a regional defense gap rather than competing with likely overlapping policies targeting more obvious high-risk states like Arizona. By focusing on Mississippi, Texas can significantly reduce imported hidden infections and minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths over the 14-day horizon."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density, Mississippi exhibits the highest (E+I)/Population ratio among origin states, with 27809 exposed and 13255 infected out of approximately 2.12 million people, yielding roughly 1.94percent infectious density. This is significantly higher than Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, whose infectious densities are much lower. Although Mississippi's average daily inbound flow to Virginia is moderate at 4459, the volume combined with its high infectious density indicates a substantial risk of importing hidden infections. Implementing targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi will capture approximately 90percent of arriving exposed and infected individuals, converting them to confirmed cases and reducing silent community transmission. This focused policy addresses a critical gap in regional defenses by targeting a high-risk but less obvious source, as larger states like Texas have lower infectious densities despite higher flow volumes. Hence, intercepting Mississippi-origin travelers complements broader regional efforts and optimally reduces cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia during the next 14 days."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals that Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density among the options: (33624+16062)/~9.95 million ¡Ö 0.005 per capita, indicating a significant hidden infectious population. New Mexico has a very low infectious density (~0.00027), Texas moderate (~0.00021), and Virginia slightly higher but still below Mississippi (~0.0023). Despite Mississippi having a smaller absolute inbound flow to Arizona (2337 daily) compared to Texas (49331) and New Mexico (26540), the high infectious density results in a disproportionately large number of potential hidden infections entering Arizona from Mississippi. Implementing a 90percent screening policy on travelers from Mississippi can effectively identify and isolate a substantial fraction of these hidden infections, reducing their contribution to Arizona's epidemic growth. Targeting Mississippi complements broader regional efforts, as other states with high inbound volumes (Texas, New Mexico) have lower infectious densities, and focusing on Mississippi fills a gap in controlling a high-risk but less voluminous source. This targeted intervention balances infection risk reduction with practical resource allocation and helps minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Arizona over the next 14 days."

 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density, defined as (E+I)/Population, for each origin state reveals that Arizona poses the highest relative risk. Arizona has 15,605 exposed and 997 infected individuals in a population of approximately 8,588,251, yielding an infectious density of about 0.00195. This is higher than New Mexico (0.00028), Texas (0.00021), and Virginia (0.00236). However, Virginia's infectious density is slightly higher but with a substantially lower inbound flow (6,108 daily) compared to Arizona's 2,819. The daily inbound flow from Arizona, while moderate, involves a large number of travelers with a significant number of hidden infectious (E+I) individuals. Implementing a 90percent rigorous screening on Arizona travelers will effectively convert a large portion of these hidden infections into confirmed cases (Q), significantly reducing the risk of undetected importation into Mississippi. While Virginia has a comparable infectious density, the lower flow limits the overall number of infected arrivals. Texas has the highest inbound flow by far (63,448 daily) but a much lower infectious density, reducing the utility of a targeted screening. New Mexico has both low infectious density and low flow, making it less critical. Choosing Arizona targets a high infectious density source with moderate flow, filling a critical gap in regional defense that might be overlooked if only focusing on the highest-volume or highest-density states. This targeted screening balances maximal detection utility with coordinated regional risk mitigation to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next 14 days."

2025-12-24 19:53:28,071 - od_agent - INFO - Region new mexico policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, with 49,686 infectious individuals out of approximately 1,745,576 total population, yielding roughly 2.85percent infectious density. This is substantially higher than Arizona (~0.19percent), Texas (~0.02percent), and Virginia (~0.24percent). Despite Mississippi's relatively low average daily inbound flow into New Mexico (1,565), the high infectious density means that even this small volume carries a significant risk of importing exposed and infected individuals. Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy on Mississippi travelers will enable rigorous 90percent detection and conversion of these hidden infections to confirmed cases (Q) upon arrival, effectively preventing a considerable number of new infections from seeding local transmission chains. Targeting Mississippi provides a strategic complement to likely efforts focusing on larger-volume states like Texas or Arizona, thus filling a critical gap in regional epidemic defense. The high detection utility from this high-risk, lower-volume source justifies the resource allocation. Conversely, while Texas and Arizona have greater inbound flows, their infectious densities are much lower, reducing the marginal benefit of screening there compared to Mississippi. Therefore, prioritizing Mississippi balances detection efficiency and resource deployment for maximal impact in minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='In evaluating inbound travel risks to Texas, we analyzed the infectious density ((E+I)/Population) of each origin state and the potential impact of targeted screening. Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density among the four states with (E+I) = 49,686 out of approximately 5,770,976 total population (sum of all compartments), equaling about 0.86percent, significantly higher than Arizona (~0.24percent), Virginia (~0.023percent), and New Mexico (~0.028percent). Mississippi also contributes a moderate daily inbound flow to Texas (~36,298), providing a substantial pathway for hidden infections. By implementing a targeted 90percent screening mandate on inbound travelers from Mississippi, we can effectively convert a large share of exposed and infected individuals into confirmed cases upon arrival, thus removing a significant number of hidden infectious persons from the community transmission chain. This intervention targets the most epidemiologically risky origin state, maximizing the detection and isolation utility. While Arizona has the highest absolute inbound flow, its infectious density is lower, reducing the relative benefit of screening there. Virginia and New Mexico have lower infectious densities and inbound flows, making them less critical targets. Choosing Mississippi aligns with a strategic focus on mitigating a high-risk yet moderately connected source, filling a critical gap in regional defenses while balancing resources. This focused approach will help minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas over the next two weeks by intercepting a disproportionate share of infectious travelers from the highest-risk origin.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density ((E+I)/Population) of each origin state, Mississippi stands out with the highest infectious density approximately 0.0287 (E=33624 + I=16062 over population ~3,837,642), which is significantly higher than Arizona (~0.0019), New Mexico (~0.00027), and Texas (~0.00021). Despite Mississippi having a relatively low daily inbound flow to Virginia (4848), the high infectious density means that even a small inflow could contribute disproportionately to importation of hidden infections into Virginia. By implementing targeted inbound screening on Mississippi travelers, we can intercept approximately 90percent of hidden infections (E+I) entering Virginia from this route, converting them directly to confirmed cases (Q), thus reducing silent community spread. Arizona and Texas have much larger inbound flows but considerably lower infectious densities, so the total number of imported infections from those states is less concerning relative to Mississippi's risk per traveler. New Mexico's infectious density and flow are both low, making it less critical. Targeting Mississippi is a strategic decision to fill a gap in regional defense by focusing on a secondary, high-risk source rather than the more obvious high-volume but low-density origins like Texas or Arizona. This focused intervention optimizes resource use and maximizes reduction in cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals that Mississippi has the highest infectious density among the four states. Specifically, Mississippi's combined exposed and infected population is 55,100 out of approximately 1,417,326 total population, yielding an infectious density of approximately 3.89percent. In contrast, Virginia's infectious density is about 0.03percent, Texas about 0.023percent, and New Mexico about 0.033percent. Despite Mississippi's smaller population size, the high infectious density combined with the moderate inbound flow of 2,348 travelers per day into Arizona creates a significant importation risk. By implementing a targeted inbound screening at Mississippi, we can rigorously screen 90percent of incoming travelers, effectively intercepting a substantial share of hidden infections (E and I) before they mix with the Arizona community. This intervention notably reduces the influx of exposed and infected individuals, thereby decreasing potential new cases and deaths in Arizona over the next two weeks. Choosing Mississippi over the larger inflow states like Texas or New Mexico is strategic; while Texas and New Mexico have higher absolute inbound flows, their infectious densities are markedly lower, reducing the marginal benefit of screening them. Virginia has a moderate risk but lower inbound flow compared to Mississippi. Targeting Mississippi fills a gap in regional defense by focusing on a high-risk smaller source that may be overlooked by other states, thus complementing broader epidemic control efforts. Hence, selecting Mississippi for targeted inbound screening optimally balances risk reduction and resource allocation to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals that Virginia has the highest infectious density (~0.0032), followed by Mississippi (~0.004), Arizona (~0.0024), Texas (~0.00023), and New Mexico (~0.00033). However, infectious density alone does not dictate risk; the volume of inbound flow is critical to the total potential importation of hidden infections. Texas stands out with an extremely high average daily inbound flow into Mississippi (57,006), dwarfing other states. Although Texas has a lower infectious density compared to Virginia, the sheer volume of travelers means the absolute number of exposed and infected individuals entering Mississippi is substantial. Implementing targeted inbound screening on Texas travelers can capture and quarantine ninety percent of these hidden infections, significantly reducing importation risk. Arizona and Virginia, despite moderate infectious densities, have much lower inbound flows, making their overall risk less impactful. New Mexico's infectious density and inbound flow are both low, posing minimal threat. By focusing on Texas, we address the primary vector of infectious importation into Mississippi, filling a critical gap in regional defense rather than redundantly screening lower-flow states with higher infectious densities. This targeted measure optimally balances detection utility and systemic risk reduction, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density defined as (E+I)/Population for each origin state, Mississippi presents an exceptionally high infectious density compared to others, with E=37228 and I=17872 over a population of approximately 1,375,773, resulting in roughly 4.0percent of the population being in exposed or infected states. In contrast, Arizona, Texas, and Virginia have significantly lower infectious densities, around 0.25percent, 0.02percent, and 0.33percent respectively. Despite Mississippi's much smaller inbound flow into New Mexico (1638) compared to Texas (119,576) or Arizona (34,721), the high concentration of hidden infections (E+I) in Mississippi travelers poses a substantial risk. Implementing a targeted inbound screening on Mississippi travelers allows identification and quarantine of 90percent of these hidden infections, effectively reducing seeding of new cases. This choice also complements broader regional efforts likely to prioritize larger states such as Texas or Arizona, thus filling a critical gap in defense against disease importation. Screening Mississippi travelers is a strategic intervention that minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico by addressing a disproportionately high-risk, though less voluminous, source of infection."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the origin states, Mississippi presents the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population = (37228 + 17872) / (1375773 + 37228 + 17872 + 11768 + 48163 + 1723) ¡Ö 0.039 or 3.9percent, which is significantly higher than other states. Arizona and Virginia have lower infectious densities (~0.002 or 0.2percent), and New Mexico is much lower (~0.0003 or 0.03percent). Despite Mississippi having a lower average daily inbound flow to Texas (33,936) compared to New Mexico (142,786) and Arizona (49,757), its very high infectious density means that a disproportionate number of exposed and infected travelers are likely entering Texas from Mississippi. By implementing targeted inbound screening for Mississippi, we leverage rigorous 90percent screening to capture and convert a substantial portion of hidden infections (E and I) to confirmed cases (Q) upon arrival, greatly reducing the risk of undetected importation. This approach focuses on a high-risk but less obvious source rather than the higher-volume but lower-prevalence states, filling a gap in regional defense. Screening Mississippi travelers provides a cost-effective and impactful intervention, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas better than screening higher volume but lower risk origins. Therefore, the policy prioritizes targeting Mississippi for a 14-day enhanced inbound screening mandate.'

Despite Mississippi's smaller inbound flow into Virginia (4413 daily), the very high infectious density means that the number of hidden infections entering Virginia from Mississippi is disproportionately high. Implementing a 90percent screening on inbound travelers from Mississippi would effectively convert a large number of these exposed and infected individuals into confirmed cases upon arrival, reducing hidden infectious spread. Arizona and Texas have much higher flows but substantially lower infectious density, making screening less impactful per traveler. New Mexico has both low infectious density and low flow. Targeting Mississippi fills a critical gap in regional defense by addressing a high-risk source that might be overlooked due to its smaller volume but higher risk per capita. This approach balances detection utility and systemic risk reduction to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia over the next 14 days."

2025-12-24 19:54:15,764 - od_agent - INFO - Region arizona policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Mississippi has the highest infectious density among the origin states, with an infectious proportion of (E+I)/Population approximately equal to (38592+18698)/6,404,805 ¡Ö 0.0091, significantly higher than New Mexico (~0.00037), Texas (~0.00025), and Virginia (~0.0043). Despite a relatively low average inbound flow to Arizona (1984 daily), the high infectious density means that many exposed and infected individuals are likely entering Arizona from Mississippi. Implementing a 90percent screening on inbound travelers from Mississippi will convert a large portion of hidden infections (E and I) directly to confirmed (Q), thus reducing the undetected infectious population entering Arizona and lowering local transmission risk. New Mexico and Texas have much larger inflows but far lower infectious densities, so the expected risk per traveler is smaller. Virginia, while having a moderate infectious density, has a lower inbound flow than Texas and less than half the infectious density of Mississippi. Targeting Mississippi is a strategic decision to address a high-risk import source with a concentrated infectious load, which may be overlooked if only volume-based criteria are used. This intervention complements other states' likely focus on larger population origins, helping fill a gap in regional defense and minimizing overall disease importation risk into Arizona."

2025-12-24 19:54:22,716 - od_agent - INFO - Region mississippi policy response:
 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density among the origin states, with approximately 31,306 infected individuals over a population of about 8,514,935, resulting in an infectious density of roughly 0.00368. Arizona has a lower infectious density (~0.0030), Texas is significantly lower (~0.00025), and New Mexico is the lowest (~0.00038). Despite Texas having the highest inbound flow into Mississippi (51,070 daily), its lower infectious density reduces its relative risk compared to Virginia. Virginia's average daily inflow into Mississippi is 4,887, which is moderate but still substantial. Implementing targeted inbound screening from Virginia will capture approximately ninety percent of exposed and infected travelers entering Mississippi, significantly reducing the hidden infectious population imported from a high-risk source. This targeted approach focuses on a secondary high-risk state, filling a gap in regional defense since Texas, despite its high volume, has lower infection prevalence, and Arizona and New Mexico have differing risk profiles and flows. By targeting Virginia, Mississippi can efficiently reduce importation risk without duplicating efforts that other agents might prioritize on higher volume but lower infectious density states. Therefore, screening inbound travelers from Virginia optimally balances risk reduction and resource allocation to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths."

2025-12-24 19:54:28,172 - od_agent - INFO - Region new mexico policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the origin states inbound to New Mexico, Mississippi presents the highest infectious density, calculated as (E + I) / Population, indicating a significant hidden infection risk. Specifically, Mississippi has 38,592 exposed and 18,698 infected individuals in a population of approximately 7,816,503, yielding an infectious density around 0.0074, substantially higher than Arizona, Texas, and Virginia. Despite its smaller daily inbound flow to New Mexico (1,219) compared to Texas (113,536) and Arizona (30,995), the high infectious density combined with the inbound flow means a notable number of hidden infections enter from Mississippi daily. Implementing rigorous 90percent screening on travelers from Mississippi will effectively convert a large portion of incoming exposed and infected individuals into confirmed cases upon arrival, thereby significantly reducing undetected importation of infections and mitigating onward community spread. This targeted approach complements broader regional defenses by focusing on a secondary, high-risk source that may be overlooked if only the largest inflows (e.g., Texas) were targeted, thus enhancing systemic risk management without duplicating efforts on obvious high-volume states. Hence, prioritizing Mississippi balances detection utility and resource allocation to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks.'

2025-12-24 19:54:32,386 - od_agent - INFO - Region texas policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density with (E+I)=57290 out of a population approximately 1093205+38592+18698+12942+63798+2168, indicating a notably high proportion of hidden infections compared to other states. This results in a significantly elevated risk of importing exposed and infected individuals into Texas. Given Mississippi's average daily inbound flow into Texas is substantial (31542), the potential for importing hidden infections is considerable. Implementing targeted screening on Mississippi travelers would convert 90percent of these hidden infections (E and I) into confirmed cases (Q) upon entry, effectively reducing undetected transmission chains within Texas. Arizona and Virginia also have large populations and inbound flows but present lower infectious densities relative to Mississippi. New Mexico has much lower infectious numbers and thus lower risk. Targeting Mississippi addresses a critical regional gap in epidemic defense, as it is a secondary source of risk that may not be prioritized by other states' agents focusing on larger states like Arizona or Virginia. This strategy balances high infection prevalence and significant mobility, maximizing the benefit of screening efforts and minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Texas over the next two weeks."

2025-12-24 19:54:37,196 - od_agent - INFO - Region virginia policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population = (38592+18698)/(1093205) ¡Ö 0.0529, which is substantially higher than Arizona (~0.0035), New Mexico (~0.00037), and Texas (~0.00025). This indicates Mississippi poses the greatest risk of importing exposed or infected individuals into Virginia. The average daily inbound flow from Mississippi to Virginia is moderate at 3879, which is lower than Arizona and Texas but still significant. Implementing targeted inbound screening on Mississippi travelers would detect and convert 90percent of hidden infections (E and I) among these entrants into confirmed cases (Q), thus substantially reducing the unseen infectious population entering Virginia. Arizona and Texas, despite larger inbound flows, have much lower infectious densities, so screening them is less impactful per traveler. New Mexico has the lowest infectious density and smallest flow to Virginia, offering minimal benefit if targeted. Choosing Mississippi addresses a critical gap by controlling a high-risk yet moderately sized flow that might be overlooked if only focusing on the largest flows with lower infection rates. This targeted approach balances risk reduction and resource allocation effectively, concentrating efforts on a high-risk source to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two weeks.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals Mississippi as the highest risk source, with a combined exposed and infected population of 52,783 out of about 6,400,000 people, yielding an infectious density near 0.825percent. While Virginia also has a high number of exposed and infected individuals (about 38,827), its population is larger, resulting in a slightly lower ratio. Texas and New Mexico have significantly lower infectious densities. Considering inbound flow volume, Texas and New Mexico have higher inflows to Arizona, but their infectious densities are much lower, diminishing the relative risk per traveler. Mississippi's inbound flow to Arizona is moderate (1,831 daily), yet due to its very high infectious density, targeting Mississippi travelers for 90percent screening can effectively intercept a large fraction of hidden infections entering Arizona. Screening would convert most exposed and infected entrants from Mississippi into confirmed cases upon arrival, substantially reducing undetected infectious importation. This targeted approach prioritizes a high-risk source that may be less likely to be concurrently targeted by other states focusing on larger volume origins like Texas or New Mexico, thereby filling a critical gap in regional defense. Overall, restricting and rigorously screening travelers from Mississippi balances risk reduction and operational feasibility, minimizing cumulative infections and deaths in Arizona over the next two weeks."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Virginia and Arizona have the highest infectious densities, calculated as (E+I)/Population. Virginia's infectious density is approximately 0.00487 (E=31470, I=7357, Population¡Ö11,315,670), while Arizona's is approximately 0.00375 (E=31330, I=1994, Population¡Ö9,465,583). Texas and New Mexico have much lower infectious densities, around 0.00027 and 0.00041 respectively. Considering inbound flows into Mississippi, Texas has the highest daily inflow (~47,740), followed by Arizona (2,383), Virginia (5,593), and New Mexico (1,338). Although Texas has the largest inflow, its infectious density is low, limiting the hidden infection risk. Virginia, however, balances a relatively high infectious density with a moderate inflow, posing a meaningful risk of introducing hidden infections. Screening at Virginia's entry points is estimated to identify 90percent of these hidden infections (E+I), effectively reducing importation of undetected cases into Mississippi and thus lowering cumulative cases and deaths. Choosing Virginia over Arizona, despite Arizona's high infectious density, is justified by Virginia's higher infected count and inflow, providing a better targeted intervention. This decision complements other states' likely focus on the largest inflow sources like Texas, filling a regional defense gap by addressing a secondary but significant risk source. Hence, implementing targeted inbound screening for travelers from Virginia for the next 14 days maximizes detection utility and minimizes epidemic importation risk to Mississippi."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The selection of Mississippi for targeted inbound screening is based on a detailed risk and utility analysis. Mississippi exhibits an extraordinarily high infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, with E=35430 and I=17353 relative to a susceptible population of 840,667, indicating a severe hidden infection burden. Despite its relatively low average daily inbound flow into New Mexico (1134 travelers), the proportion of hidden infections traveling is significant and poses a high risk for seeding new cases. Imposing a rigorous 90percent screening mandate on travelers from Mississippi would convert most exposed and infected individuals to confirmed status upon arrival, reducing silent importation and potential community spread. In contrast, Arizona and Texas, while having higher inbound flows, have lower infectious densities: Arizona¡¯s (E+I) is 33224 over a population around 9 million, and Texas¡¯s is 6832 over 24.7 million, diluting their risk per traveler. Virginia also has elevated infections but with moderate inbound flow and lower density than Mississippi. Strategically, targeting Mississippi addresses a critical gap in defense by focusing on a smaller but highly infectious source less likely to be prioritized by other states, achieving a better regional risk distribution. This focused intervention maximizes detection utility and minimizes cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Evaluating the infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, Mississippi shows an extremely high risk with (35430+17353)/(840667+35430+17353+13091+80394+2605) roughly 41percent, which is orders of magnitude higher than other origins: Arizona (~0.4percent), Virginia (~0.45percent), and New Mexico (~0.04percent). This indicates Mississippi harbors a very large proportion of hidden infectious individuals relative to its population, posing a severe importation risk to Texas. The average daily inbound flow from Mississippi to Texas is 29,893, which is moderate but significant enough that screening can substantially reduce imported infections. With a 90percent screening efficacy, the policy would identify and quarantine a large fraction of exposed and infected travelers from Mississippi, thus effectively cutting down hidden transmissions introduced into Texas. Arizona and Virginia have larger flows but much lower infectious densities, while New Mexico, despite the highest flow, has minimal infectious density. Targeting Mississippi addresses a critical gap in inbound risk management by focusing on a high-density, moderate-flow origin that may be underprioritized by other agents who might focus on larger states with lower infectious density. This strategic choice maximizes detection utility and minimizes cumulative cases and deaths in Texas over the next two weeks.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals that Mississippi has the highest infectious density by a significant margin. Mississippi's exposed plus infected population is 52783 (E=35430, I=17353) out of approximately 840667 total, yielding an infectious density of about 6.28percent, which is substantially higher than Arizona (~0.38percent), New Mexico (~0.04percent), and Texas (~0.03percent). Despite Mississippi's relatively low inbound flow to Virginia (3963 daily), the high infectious density and absolute number of hidden infections (E+I) traveling represent a critical risk. By selecting Mississippi for targeted inbound screening, rigorous ninety percent detection can convert a large portion of hidden infections entering Virginia into confirmed cases (Q), effectively reducing the silent spread from this high-risk source. Arizona and Texas have much higher inbound flows but much lower infectious densities, while New Mexico has both low infectious density and low flow. Targeting Mississippi fills a gap in regional defense by focusing on a smaller but more heavily infected source, likely underprioritized by other agents who might focus on larger states like Texas or Arizona. This choice balances systemic risk reduction by addressing a high-risk node with manageable flow volume, maximizing detection utility and minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, with (29034+14343)/6433672 ¡Ö 0.0067, significantly higher than New Mexico (~0.00047), Texas (~0.0003), and Virginia (~0.0056). This elevated infectious density indicates a higher proportion of hidden infections that could contribute to imported cases into Arizona. Despite having a moderate average daily inbound flow (1898) compared to Texas (43694) and New Mexico (28122), Mississippi's high infectious density makes its travelers more likely to introduce new infections. Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy on Mississippi travelers will capture approximately 90percent of hidden infections (E and I) entering Arizona from this source, substantially reducing the risk of seeding new transmissions. Targeting Mississippi also complements regional defense by addressing a high-risk but less obvious source, as other agents might prioritize larger flows from Texas or New Mexico. This choice balances risk and flow volume, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by intercepting a disproportionately infectious inflow that would otherwise remain largely undetected. Therefore, restricting and rigorously screening inbound travelers from Mississippi for the next 14 days is the optimal intervention to protect Arizona's public health."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals that Virginia has the highest infectious density among the options, indicating a greater proportion of hidden infections entering Mississippi from Virginia. Specifically, Virginia's infectious density is approximately 0.0057 ((38643+9041)/8450691), which is notably higher than Texas (~0.0003), Arizona (~0.0047), and New Mexico (~0.00046). Although Arizona has a large absolute number of exposed individuals, its infectious density is slightly lower than Virginia's. Considering the inbound flows, Virginia contributes a moderate daily average of 4911 travelers into Mississippi, which is substantial enough to pose risk but not as overwhelming as Texas's 42933. Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy on Virginia travelers with a 90percent screening efficacy will convert a significant portion of exposed and infected individuals into confirmed cases upon arrival, thus reducing the hidden infectious population and slowing community spread. This intervention strategically targets a secondary yet high-risk source state, filling a likely gap in regional defense where other agents might prioritize Texas or Arizona due to sheer volume. Screening Virginia travelers complements broader regional efforts by focusing on a source with high infectious density but moderate flow, maximizing detection efficiency per screened traveler and minimizing systemic importation risks. Therefore, restricting and rigorously screening inbound travelers from Virginia best balances risk reduction and resource allocation to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next 14 days."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, indicating a significant hidden infectious risk. Despite its smaller population compared to other states, Mississippi's exposed and infected counts (E=29034, I=14343) relative to its population (~6.7 million) yield a far greater proportion of potentially infectious travelers than Arizona, Texas, or Virginia. The average daily inbound flow from Mississippi to New Mexico is relatively low (1317), but even this smaller volume presents a notable risk due to the high hidden infectious density. Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy on Mississippi travelers would effectively convert 90percent of exposed and infected individuals entering New Mexico into confirmed cases (Q), drastically reducing the number of undetected infections entering the community. This focused approach addresses a critical gap in regional defense by targeting a secondary high-risk source that might be overlooked if only the largest volume or most obvious states like Texas or Arizona were selected. Arizona and Texas have higher inbound flows but lower infectious densities, and Virginia's infectious density is moderately high but with a lower flow than Texas. Hence, prioritizing Mississippi balances detection utility with infection risk reduction, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks."

2025-12-24 19:55:30,523 - od_agent - INFO - Region texas policy response:
 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density defined as (E+I)/Population, Virginia poses the highest risk among the listed origin states. Virginia's exposed and infected sum to 47,684 over a population of approximately 8,450,691, yielding an infectious density of about 0.00564. Mississippi and Arizona have lower infectious densities of roughly 0.031 and 0.0049 respectively, but Mississippi's much smaller population inflow to Texas (31,493) compared to New Mexico and Virginia makes its overall importation risk lower. New Mexico, while having a large inflow to Texas (149,077), has a very low infectious density (around 0.00047) due to low E and I counts. Screening and detection via a 90percent Q-conversion at Virginia's border can capture a significant number of hidden infections¡ªapproximately 0.9 * (E+I) * daily inflow fraction¡ªgreatly reducing the risk of importing infectious individuals. Given Virginia's sizable flow into Texas (26,290 daily) and its high infectious density, targeting Virginia for inbound screening is the optimal choice. This approach prioritizes a high-risk state with substantial mobility ties to Texas, ensuring maximum reduction in hidden infectious entries. Choosing Virginia also complements other states' likely policies, potentially focusing on different origins, thus filling a regional gap and enhancing overall defense against disease spread into Texas."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to target Mississippi for the 14-day inbound screening policy is based on a thorough risk and impact assessment. Mississippi exhibits a notably high infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population = (29034+14343)/(682071+29034+14343+11824+96327+2988) which is significantly higher than other origin states, indicating a greater proportion of hidden infectious individuals in its population. Despite Mississippi having a moderate inbound flow to Virginia (3517 daily), the high infectious density implies that a substantial number of exposed and infected travelers could be entering Virginia undetected. Implementing a 90percent rigorous screening and detection for travelers from Mississippi will effectively convert the majority of these hidden infections into confirmed cases (Q), reducing the risk of community spread in Virginia. In contrast, Texas and Arizona have higher inbound flows but much lower infectious density, and New Mexico has both low infectious density and low flow, making their impact less critical. This policy choice strategically targets an overlooked high-risk source rather than the obvious high-volume states, filling a regional defense gap and complementing other agents' likely focus on larger states. Hence, focusing resources on Mississippi maximizes detection utility and reduces systemic risk to Virginia with a focused, high-impact intervention."

2025-12-24 19:55:40,187 - od_agent - INFO - Region arizona policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits a notably high infectious density with (E+I) = 39873 over a population of approximately 611,620, resulting in an infectious density of about 6.52percent, which is substantially higher than New Mexico (~0.05percent), Texas (~0.045percent), and Virginia (~0.7percent). Additionally, the average daily inbound flow from Mississippi into Arizona is moderate at 1,731 travelers. Applying a 90percent screening mandate here would effectively identify and quarantine a large portion of hidden infections from this high-risk source, significantly reducing the risk of introducing additional exposed and infected individuals into Arizona. Although Texas has the largest absolute inbound flow (44,065), its infectious density is much lower, thus the marginal benefit of targeting Texas is less pronounced per traveler. Virginia's infectious density is higher than Texas but lower than Mississippi, and its inflow is also lower. New Mexico has the highest inflow after Texas but extremely low infectious density. Targeting Mississippi thus addresses a critical gap in regional defense by focusing on a smaller yet highly infectious population that other states or agents might overlook, rather than competing to screen the more obvious high-volume but lower-risk Texas flow. This targeted approach optimizes resource use and maximizes the reduction in hidden infectious imports, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona over the next two weeks."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density, Virginia has (E+I)=57966 out of a total population approximated by summing compartments S+E+I+Q+R+D=8373235+46965+11001+71604+378897+2632=8,602,334, yielding an infectious density of about 0.00674, which is significantly higher than Texas (about 0.00046), New Mexico (about 0.00054), and Arizona (about 0.00616). Although Arizona has a large infectious count, its infectious density is slightly lower than Virginia's. The inbound flow from Virginia to Mississippi is relatively moderate at 3822 daily travelers compared to Texas' much larger flow of 39373. Targeting Virginia offers a strategic advantage: screening 90percent of inbound travelers from Virginia effectively intercepts a substantial number of hidden infections (E+I), reducing unseen importation risks. Given the large infectious density and moderate flow, this intervention balances impact and resource allocation. Choosing Virginia instead of Texas or Arizona prevents overlapping with other states likely focusing on the largest flow sources (like Texas) and fills a regional defense gap against a high-risk but moderate-volume origin. This targeted inbound screening will minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi by significantly reducing hidden infectious entries from a high-risk state while maintaining baseline flows from other origins."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density ((E+I)/Population) of each origin state reveals that Mississippi has a notably high infectious density of approximately 0.064 compared to Arizona (~0.006), Texas (~0.00046), and Virginia (~0.007). Despite Mississippi having a relatively low average daily inbound flow into New Mexico (1372), the high infectious density translates into a considerable number of hidden infections entering New Mexico daily from this source. Implementing targeted inbound screening on Mississippi travelers enables the detection and conversion of 90percent of these hidden infections (E and I) into confirmed cases (Q) upon arrival, significantly limiting the introduction of undetected infectious individuals into New Mexico's community. While Arizona and Texas have much larger inbound flows, their infectious densities are substantially lower, meaning the screening would capture fewer hidden infections proportionally. Screening Mississippi fills a critical gap in regional defense by addressing a secondary but high-risk source that may be overlooked if efforts focus solely on the obvious high-volume states. This targeted approach optimizes resource use and minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Analyzing the infectious density of each origin state, Mississippi presents the highest ratio of hidden infections relative to its population, with (E+I)/(S+E+I+Q+R+D) approximately 0.0319, which is significantly higher than Arizona (~0.0042), New Mexico (~0.0005), and Virginia (~0.0068). Despite a moderate inbound flow into Texas (~29,713 daily), the elevated hidden infectious population in Mississippi poses a substantial risk of importing undetected cases. Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy for Mississippi travelers enables rigorous detection of 90percent of exposed and infected individuals at arrival, converting them to confirmed cases and reducing silent transmission. Arizona, while having a large absolute number of cases, has a much lower infectious density and a comparable flow, making Mississippi the more impactful intervention point. New Mexico and Virginia have either lower infectious densities or lower daily inbound flows, reducing their relative risk contribution. By selecting Mississippi for inbound screening, Texas strategically addresses a high-risk source potentially overlooked by other states focusing on larger but less dense sources, filling a critical gap in regional defense and minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. This focused intervention optimally balances screening resource allocation and disease importation risk mitigation over the next 14 days.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Assessing the infectious density ((E+I)/Population) for each origin state reveals that Mississippi has a significantly higher infectious density compared to Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Mississippi's exposed and infected individuals sum to 39873 over a population of approximately 876,989, yielding an infectious density of about 4.54percent, which is considerably higher than Arizona (~0.60percent), New Mexico (~0.05percent), and Texas (~0.05percent). Considering inbound flows to Virginia, Texas contributes the largest volume daily (24,012), but its infectious density is very low, reducing the risk of importation. Mississippi, despite a smaller inflow of 3,518, poses a greater risk per traveler due to its high infectious density. Implementing a 90percent screening on inbound travelers from Mississippi can effectively capture a large proportion of hidden infections (E and I), substantially lowering the risk of seeding new cases in Virginia. Targeting Mississippi fills a critical gap in regional defense by focusing on a secondary but high-risk source state, rather than competing with others likely to target larger states like Texas or Arizona. This strategic choice maximizes detection utility and minimizes imported infections. Hence, the recommendation is to enforce Targeted Inbound Screening for travelers from Mississippi for the next 14 days to mitigate cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi presents the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population = (40925+14804)/6656709 ¡Ö 0.0084, significantly higher than New Mexico (~0.00065), Texas (~0.00059), and Virginia (~0.0087). Although Virginia's infectious density is close, Mississippi's inbound flow to Arizona is substantial at 1989 daily travelers, providing a meaningful vector for disease importation. By implementing targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi, we can rigorously screen 90percent of inbound travelers, effectively converting a large fraction of hidden infectious individuals (E and I) into confirmed cases (Q) upon arrival. This intervention reduces the unnoticed seeding of infections in Arizona more effectively than targeting states with either lower infectious densities or higher flows but lower infection rates. Coordination-wise, targeting Mississippi fills a critical gap as it may be overlooked due to its smaller flow compared to Texas or New Mexico but poses a disproportionately high risk due to its infection prevalence. This focused screening effort balances resource allocation and maximizes impact on minimizing cumulative cases and deaths over the next 14 days in Arizona."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the origin states, Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population approximately 6.5e-3, calculated as (56217+13189)/8256921, which is higher than Arizona (~7.4e-3 but coupled with extremely high inbound flow mostly elsewhere), New Mexico (~6.0e-4), and Texas (~6.9e-4). Although Arizona has a large absolute number of exposed individuals, the daily inbound flow from Arizona to Mississippi is very low (~2159), limiting its importation risk. Texas has a very high inbound flow (~39010) but a lower infectious density compared to Virginia, making Virginia a more targeted and efficient source for screening. Targeting Virginia allows us to capture a substantial portion of hidden infections entering Mississippi due to its moderate inbound flow (~4112) combined with the high infectious density. Enforcing rigorous 90percent screening on travelers from Virginia would significantly reduce the importation of hidden E and I cases, converting them to confirmed Q and thus isolating them promptly. This targeted approach balances maximal reduction in imported infections while not overburdening resources by screening low-risk or very high volume but low prevalence sources. By selecting Virginia, we strategically fill a gap in regional defense, targeting an important secondary source of infections that might be overlooked if only focusing on the largest flows such as Texas. This focused intervention is expected to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next 14 days effectively.'

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Analyzing the infectious density ((E+I)/Population) for each origin state relative to new mexico reveals critical insights for targeted inbound screening. Arizona has an infectious density of approximately 0.0072 (E=61440 + I=3911 over population ~9 million), Mississippi shows a notably high infectious density around 0.102 (E=40925 + I=14804 over ~550k population), Texas has a low infectious density near 0.0006, and Virginia presents a moderately high infectious density of roughly 0.0088 (E=56217 + I=13189 over ~8.25 million). However, the daily inbound flow from each state into new mexico varies significantly; Texas leads with about 99,222 daily travelers, followed by Arizona (32,596), Virginia (2,025), and Mississippi (1,497). While Mississippi has the highest infectious density, its very low inbound flow limits its overall risk contribution. Texas has the largest flow but low infectious density, thus lower importation risk per traveler. Virginia strikes a balance with a moderately high infectious density and a non-negligible inbound flow. Implementing a targeted screening policy on travelers from Virginia will capture a meaningful number of hidden infections (E and I) due to the reasonable mix of flow and infection prevalence, reducing the hidden infectious population entering new mexico significantly by quarantining 90percent of such cases. Although Arizona shows a high absolute number of infections, it has a comparable infectious density but a higher flow, yet Virginia¡¯s combination of moderate flow and higher infectious density offers a strategic secondary layer of defense to complement other agents likely focusing on Arizona or Texas. This approach fills a regional gap and optimizes resource use to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in new mexico effectively.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi presents the highest infectious density when considering the ratio of exposed and infected individuals to its population, with E+I totaling 55,729 over a relatively smaller population base of approximately 549,334 susceptible individuals, indicating a significantly higher risk of incoming infection compared to other states. Despite a lower absolute population compared to Arizona or Virginia, the high proportion of hidden infectious individuals (E and I) combined with a substantial average daily inbound flow of 29,421 travelers to Texas implies a high volume of potentially undetected infectious travelers entering. Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy focusing on Mississippi will enable the rigorous 90percent conversion of exposed and infected arrivals into confirmed cases, effectively reducing the hidden infectious population entering Texas and thereby curtailing onward community transmission. While Arizona and Virginia have higher absolute numbers of exposed and infected, their larger populations dilute the infectious density, and their inbound flows, while significant, are not as concentrated as Mississippi's relative risk. New Mexico has comparatively low infectious density and inbound flow. By targeting Mississippi, this policy fills a gap in regional defense by addressing a high-risk source that might be overlooked if focus is only on larger states with more total cases but lower relative risk. This approach balances detection utility and systemic risk reduction, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density, Mississippi shows a very high infectious density with (E+I) = 55729 in a population of 549334, yielding about 10.14percent, which is dramatically higher than other origin states. Arizona's infectious density is roughly (61440+3911)/~9M = 0.7percent, New Mexico's is about (4016+866)/~7.7M = 0.06percent, and Texas's is (5150+8530)/~22.6M = 0.06percent. This indicates Mississippi is a critical source of hidden infections. The inbound flow from Mississippi to Virginia is moderate at 3739 daily, but given the extremely high infectious density, even this modest flow carries significant risk. Implementing targeted screening on travelers from Mississippi could capture and convert approximately 90percent of these hidden infections (E and I) to confirmed cases (Q), effectively preventing a large number of infectious individuals from entering undetected. Although Texas and Arizona have higher absolute inbound flows, their infectious densities are much lower, meaning fewer hidden infections per traveler. Selecting Mississippi is a strategic choice to fill a gap in regional defense against a concentrated high-risk source. Other agents might overlook Mississippi due to its smaller size and flow, so Virginia's targeted screening here efficiently reduces importation risk without duplicating efforts on more obvious larger states. Therefore, enforcing a rigorous 90percent screening mandate on inbound travelers from Mississippi for 14 days will maximize detection utility and minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population approximately 75,116/(6,605,055) ¡Ö 0.01137, significantly greater than New Mexico (~0.0008), Texas (~0.0006), and Virginia (~0.0101). The high infectious density combined with a non-negligible daily inbound flow to Arizona (2,279 travelers) suggests that Mississippi is a substantial contributor of hidden infections. Implementing the targeted inbound screening policy for Mississippi travelers enables rigorous detection and conversion of 90percent of exposed and infected individuals into confirmed cases at the border, effectively reducing hidden infectious entries from this high-risk source. The expected detection utility is meaningful given that about 75,116 individuals in Mississippi are currently in E or I compartments, and with daily inflow, many hidden infections could arrive without screening. Screening Mississippi travelers addresses a critical gap since Texas and New Mexico have much larger flows but lower infectious densities, while Virginia, though having a high infectious density, has a lower inflow volume compared to Texas and New Mexico. Prioritizing Mississippi balances risk and volume, mitigating a high-risk import source that might be overlooked by others focusing on larger states like Texas. This targeted approach efficiently minimizes Arizona's cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by cutting the most impactful hidden infection influx, complementing other regional controls and avoiding unnecessary restrictions on states with lower risk or overwhelming volume but lower infection prevalence."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals critical insights: Arizona has approximately 81,915 infectious individuals out of roughly 9,158,707 population (E+I=76078+4837=80915), giving an infectious density of about 0.00884; New Mexico shows a much lower infectious density of about 0.0008 (E+I=5413+1161=6574 over population ~8,261,401); Texas has an infectious density of roughly 0.00058 (13123 infectious over 21,768,993 population); and Virginia has the highest infectious density at about 0.0099 (E+I=66363+15601=81964 over population ~8,148,829). Considering the average daily inbound flow into Mississippi, Texas contributes the largest flow (~38,445), followed by Arizona (~2,109), Virginia (~4,465), and New Mexico (~1,148). Despite Texas having the highest inbound flow, its relatively low infectious density reduces per traveler risk. Virginia, though with moderate flow, poses the greatest risk due to its highest infectious density. Screening 90percent of inbound travelers from Virginia would effectively detect and quarantine a substantial number of hidden infections, significantly reducing importation risk. Targeting Virginia addresses a critical gap as other agents may focus on more obvious high-volume sources like Texas or Arizona, thus enhancing regional defense by mitigating a high-risk yet moderate-volume source. This targeted inbound screening from Virginia balances impact and resource allocation to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next two weeks.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density, which is calculated as (E+I)/Population, reveals Mississippi as the highest risk source. Mississippi has 54776 exposed and 20340 infected individuals out of a total population of approximately 502344+54776+20340+12245+136023+3759 = 729487 (sum of all compartments), leading to an infectious density of about 10.5percent. In contrast, Arizona¡¯s infectious density is about 0.9percent (E+I = 80915 out of roughly 1,228,353 total), Texas about 0.06percent, and Virginia about 1percent. Despite Mississippi's smaller population, its extremely high infectious density combined with the inbound flow of 1459 travelers daily to New Mexico means a significant number of hidden infections could be imported. Screening these travelers with a 90percent detection rate would convert a large portion of exposed and infected individuals into confirmed cases, effectively reducing silent transmission chains. Arizona and Texas have much larger inbound flows but significantly lower infectious densities, meaning fewer hidden infections per traveler. Virginia has moderate infectious density but very low inbound flow. Targeting Mississippi fills a strategic gap by focusing on a high infection concentration origin that might be overlooked by others who prioritize larger states with lower infection rates. This targeted screening will minimize imported hidden infections and help reduce cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, reveals that Mississippi has an extremely high infectious density presence compared to other origin states. With E=54,776 and I=20,340 among a population roughly estimated from the sum of compartments, Mississippi's hidden infectious pool is considerably large. Despite a moderate inbound flow to Texas (~30,676 daily), the sheer volume of exposed and infected individuals poses a significant risk for disease importation. Screening travelers from Mississippi would intercept approximately 90percent of these hidden infections, effectively converting them to confirmed cases (Q) upon arrival and substantially mitigating silent community spread. Arizona and Virginia have larger populations and inbound flows but lower infectious density ratios, while New Mexico shows the lowest infectious density and highest inbound flow, making it less critical for targeted screening. Targeting Mississippi fills a strategic gap in regional defense by focusing on a high-risk but less obvious state, complementing other states¡¯ efforts and avoiding duplication. This targeted inbound screening from Mississippi balances detection utility and epidemiological impact, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Texas over the next 14 days."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density among the origin states, with (E+I) totaling 96315 against a population sum of approximately 470801+69518+26797+16145+153675+4020= approximately 733956, yielding an infectious density of about 13.12percent, which is markedly higher than New Mexico (~0.09percent), Texas (~0.06percent), and Virginia (~1.18percent). This elevated infectious density signals a substantial risk of importing hidden infections into Arizona. Mississippi's average daily inbound flow to Arizona is 1918, smaller than Texas and New Mexico but still significant. Implementing targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi would capture approximately 90percent of the exposed and infected individuals arriving, effectively converting a large portion of hidden infections into confirmed cases (Q) upon arrival and reducing silent community spread. Although Texas has a larger absolute inbound flow (47112) and Virginia has a moderate infectious density, their lower infection prevalence and the dilutive effect of their large populations reduce the relative risk per traveler. New Mexico has a high inbound flow but very low infectious density, making screening less impactful there. Selecting Mississippi targets the most infectious and high-risk origin state that may be under-addressed by other agents, filling a critical gap in regional epidemic defense. This focused approach balances resource use and maximizes impact in reducing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona over the 14-day horizon."

 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Arizona exhibits the highest infectious density, with (E+I)/Population approximately (93663+5948)/~9,060,388 = 0.0112 or 1.12percent. This is significantly higher than Virginia (~1.2percent), New Mexico (~0.1percent), and Texas (~0.0006percent). Arizona also has a substantial inbound flow to Mississippi at 2086 daily travelers. Targeting Arizona for inbound screening would allow rigorous 90percent detection of hidden infectious travelers (E and I), substantially reducing the imported hidden infections that fuel local spread. For example, roughly 90percent of (93663+5948)/9,060,388 * 2086 ¡Ö 210 hidden infectious individuals per day could be identified and quarantined upon arrival, sharply cutting the risk of new chains of transmission. While Virginia also has a notable infectious density and inbound flow, Arizona's slightly higher infectious prevalence and comparable flow make it the more impactful choice. New Mexico and Texas have much lower infectious densities, so targeting them yields less benefit. Choosing Arizona addresses the largest single source of infection importation, prioritizing systemic risk reduction rather than splitting efforts on lower-risk states. This focused approach optimizes resource use and minimizes cumulative cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next 14 days."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density defined as (E+I)/Population. Calculating approximate infectious densities: Arizona (E+I)/Population ¡Ö (93663+5948)/~9,000,000 ¡Ö 0.0111, Mississippi ¡Ö (69518+26797)/~470,801 ¡Ö 0.206, Texas ¡Ö (5350+8642)/~20,870,526 ¡Ö 0.0006, Virginia ¡Ö (77030+18149)/~8,057,392 ¡Ö 0.0119. Mississippi's infectious density is an order of magnitude greater than others, indicating a highly concentrated infectious risk despite its smaller population size. Although Mississippi's average inbound flow into New Mexico is low (1137 daily), the screening mandate's utility is maximized by capturing a large proportion of hidden infections (E and I) due to its high infectious density. Screening 90percent of incoming travelers from Mississippi will significantly reduce the importation of hidden infections that would otherwise seed new cases in New Mexico. Targeting Mississippi is a strategic move that complements likely broader screening efforts focused on larger states like Arizona or Texas by other jurisdictions, thus filling a regional defense gap against a high-risk source that might otherwise be overlooked. This focused approach balances risk reduction with operational feasibility and avoids overextending screening resources on states with much lower infectious densities. Therefore, imposing targeted inbound screening on Mississippi optimally reduces cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density ((E+I)/Population) for each origin state reveals varying risks. Arizona has an infectious density of approximately 0.0116, Mississippi about 0.066, New Mexico roughly 0.00096, and Virginia about 0.0115. Despite Mississippi's notably high infectious density, its average daily inbound flow into Texas is relatively low at 28,922 compared to Virginia's 25,030 and New Mexico's 134,761. However, New Mexico's infectious density is very low, diminishing its risk profile. Virginia combines a moderately high infectious density with a substantial inbound flow, resulting in a significant potential importation of hidden infections. Implementing targeted inbound screening for travelers from Virginia would likely capture and convert a large number of exposed and infected individuals (hidden infections) into confirmed cases (Q), thereby reducing silent community spread. The 90percent screening mandate on Virginia arrivals will effectively cut down the hidden infectious population entering Texas from this state. Coordination versus competition considerations suggest that while Mississippi's high infectious density is concerning, its lower mobility volume limits the overall risk, and New Mexico's low density reduces its threat. Arizona's infectious density and flow are notable but slightly less critical than Virginia's combined risk. Targeting Virginia fills a critical gap in regional defense against importation risk from a populous, moderately infectious source with significant mobility to Texas. Therefore, the chosen policy maximizes detection utility and systemic risk reduction over the 14-day horizon."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the given origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, with E=69518 and I=26797 over a population roughly summing to S+E+I+Q+R+D = 470801+69518+26797+16145+153675+4020 = approximately 724956. This yields an infectious density of about 13.1percent, significantly exceeding that of Arizona (~0.7percent), New Mexico (~0.1percent), and Texas (~0.06percent). Despite its smaller population, Mississippi¡¯s elevated infectious density represents a critical importation risk. The inbound flow from Mississippi to Virginia is moderate at 3545 daily travelers, making it a feasible target for screening without overwhelming logistical capacity. By enforcing a 90percent screening and detection mandate for travelers from Mississippi, a large proportion of exposed and infected individuals entering Virginia would be identified and quarantined immediately, substantially reducing hidden infectious seeding. While Texas has the highest absolute flow to Virginia (21662), its infectious density is low, limiting the incremental benefit of screening there. Arizona has a higher infectious density than Texas but lower than Mississippi and a large flow; however, the risk concentration is still lower. Targeting Mississippi fills a niche in regional defense by addressing a high-risk, moderate-flow source that might be overlooked if only the largest flows or states with moderate infection rates are considered. This approach balances risk reduction and operational feasibility to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two weeks.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement targeted inbound screening from Mississippi is driven primarily by its exceptionally high infectious density and the potential impact of screening there. Mississippi's infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, is approximately (86086+34753)/6630556 = 0.0181 or 1.81percent, significantly higher than other origin states: New Mexico (~0.0012), Texas (~0.0014), and Virginia (~0.0135). Despite having a relatively lower inbound flow to Arizona (1900 daily), the high proportion of hidden infections (E and I) entering from Mississippi means that rigorous screening capturing 90percent of these cases would substantially reduce the number of exposed and infected travelers entering Arizona undetected. This screening will convert these hidden infections directly into confirmed cases (Q), enabling immediate isolation and reducing onward transmission. Choosing Mississippi also reflects a strategic coordination decision: while Texas and New Mexico have higher inbound flows, their infectious densities are much lower, making screening there less efficient in reducing importation risk. Virginia has a moderately high infectious density but a smaller inbound flow compared to Texas and New Mexico. By focusing on Mississippi, Arizona targets a high-risk, less obvious source that might be under-monitored by other states or agencies, thus filling a gap in regional defense and maximizing the marginal benefit of screening resources. This targeted approach aligns with the objective to minimize cumulative cases and deaths by efficiently intercepting a high-risk population segment with a manageable screening burden."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the Infectious Density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals the following: Arizona has approximately (113893+7240)/8,653,476 ¡Ö 0.0137, New Mexico (9522+2023)/9,804,970 ¡Ö 0.0012, Texas (9664+15687)/20,111,434 ¡Ö 0.0012, and Virginia (87840+20759)/8,046,278 ¡Ö 0.0135. Arizona and Virginia both show high infectious densities, but Arizona's massive inflow to Mississippi is only about 2,050 daily, whereas Virginia's daily inflow is 3,845, nearly double, increasing the risk of importation. Screening at Virginia's border can capture approximately 90percent of inbound infected and exposed individuals¡ªtranslating to roughly 9,000 hidden infections identified and quarantined over two weeks (3,845 daily inflow ¡Á ~0.0135 infectious density ¡Á 0.9 ¡Á 14 days). This would significantly reduce hidden seeding of infections in Mississippi. Arizona, despite a similar infectious density, has a smaller inflow, making its absolute importation risk lower. New Mexico and Texas have much lower infectious densities, making their import risks less concerning. Targeting Virginia balances the need to address a high-risk source with substantial travel volume, filling a critical gap in regional defense without overlapping excessively with expected policies focused on Arizona or Texas. Thus, enforcing rigorous screening on inbound travelers from Virginia for the next two weeks is the optimal strategy to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the origin states, Mississippi presents the highest infectious density ((E+I)/Population) at approximately 0.028 (E=86086 + I=34753 over population ~6630556), significantly higher than Arizona (~0.014), Virginia (~0.0135), and Texas (~0.0012). Despite its much smaller inbound flow into New Mexico (~1129 daily) compared to Texas (~73550) and Arizona (~28775), the high infectious density means that even a small number of incoming travelers can introduce a disproportionately high number of hidden infections. By targeting Mississippi for rigorous 90percent screening, we can effectively convert a large portion of exposed and infected travelers into confirmed cases (Q), substantially reducing the hidden infectious pool entering New Mexico. This strategy focuses on a secondary source of risk rather than the obvious large-volume states, filling a critical gap in regional defense and complementing probable screening efforts by other states on major sources like Texas and Arizona. Texas, although having the highest inbound flow, has a very low infectious density, reducing the marginal benefit of screening there. Arizona and Virginia have moderate infectious densities but much higher volumes, yet their infection rates are less severe than Mississippi¡¯s per capita risk. Hence, prioritizing Mississippi balances detection utility and risk mitigation by capturing high-risk travelers from a smaller but more infectious source, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population approximately 0.286, calculated from E=86086 and I=34753 over a population sum around 435534+86086+34753+21195+176925+4317= roughly 775810. This very high infectious density signals a significant risk of importing hidden infections into Texas. Although Arizona has a larger population and higher absolute numbers, its infectious density is much lower (~0.014). New Mexico and Virginia have lower infectious densities (~0.0013 and ~0.013 respectively). The inbound flow from Mississippi to Texas averages 28,405 daily, which is substantial but smaller than New Mexico's flow (129,254) and Arizona's flow (42,590). Despite this, Mississippi's extremely high infectious density means even this moderate flow likely carries a disproportionate number of exposed and infected individuals. Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy on Mississippi would rigorously screen 90percent of incoming travelers, converting most hidden infections to confirmed cases (Q), thus effectively reducing the silent seeding of new cases in Texas. This action addresses a critical gap in regional defense by targeting a secondary but extremely high-risk source, rather than competing for the obvious high-volume but lower-risk states like New Mexico or Arizona. Consequently, this targeted measure optimizes detection utility and minimizes cumulative infections and deaths over the next two weeks by blocking a highly infectious import route without overextending resources on lower-risk origins."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the provided origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density with a combined exposed and infected population of 120,839 out of a total population of approximately 435,534+86086+34753+21195+176925+4317, resulting in a notably high (E+I)/Population ratio. This indicates a significant hidden infectious burden relative to its population size. Mississippi's average daily inbound flow into Virginia is 3,183, which, while lower than other states, still represents a meaningful vector for disease importation. Screening travelers from Mississippi with a 90percent detection rate of exposed and infected individuals would substantially reduce the introduction of hidden infections into Virginia, converting a large portion of these cases directly to confirmed status (Q) and enabling proper isolation and treatment. Arizona and Texas, despite having higher absolute inbound flows, have lower infectious densities relative to their populations, and New Mexico has both low infectious density and low flow. Targeting Mississippi fills a strategic regional gap, as it is a secondary source with elevated risk often overlooked compared to higher flow states. By focusing on Mississippi, Virginia can effectively mitigate a disproportionate risk source, complementing broader regional efforts and avoiding redundant screening on states with lower relative infectious risk. Hence, the recommended policy is to implement targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi for the upcoming 14 days."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, with (86386+35563)/6318817 ¡Ö 0.0194, which is significantly higher than New Mexico (~0.0015), Texas (~0.0017), and Virginia (~0.0154). The daily inbound flow from Mississippi to Arizona is relatively low at 2184, but due to the very high proportion of exposed and infected individuals, these travelers represent a disproportionately large risk for seeding new infections in Arizona. Implementing targeted inbound screening for Mississippi travelers will enable identification and quarantine of approximately 90percent of the hidden infections (E and I) among these arrivals, effectively reducing the importation of infectious individuals into Arizona. Given the high infectious density and the sufficiently significant flow, this intervention yields substantial detection utility by converting hidden infectious travelers to confirmed cases, thus lowering onward transmission risk. While Texas and Virginia have higher absolute inbound flows, their infectious densities are much lower, and New Mexico, despite moderate flow, has very low infectious density. Focusing on Mississippi addresses a critical gap in regional defense by targeting a high-risk but smaller flow source that might be overlooked if only the largest flows are considered. This precise targeting complements broader regional efforts and optimizes Arizona's control strategy to minimize cumulative cases and deaths over the next two weeks."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population approximately 0.0153, calculated from E=97651 and I=23142 against a total population sum around 7974629. Despite Texas having a larger absolute number of infected individuals, its infectious density is much lower (~0.0016), and Arizona and New Mexico also have lower infectious densities (~0.017 for Arizona but with much higher population diluting the density, and ~0.0013 for New Mexico). The daily inbound flow from Virginia into Mississippi is moderate at 4629, which allows effective targeting without overwhelming resources, unlike Texas's very high inflow of 47560. Implementing a 90percent rigorous screening at the Virginia-Mississippi border would significantly convert a large portion of hidden exposed and infected travelers into confirmed cases, dramatically reducing the importation of active transmission risk into Mississippi. This targeted approach addresses a secondary yet substantial source of risk that may be overlooked if only the highest-volume or highest absolute infected states were targeted. By focusing on Virginia, Mississippi maximizes detection utility in a manageable flow, balancing systemic risk reduction and operational feasibility. Choosing Virginia over Texas or Arizona also complements regional coordination by not duplicating efforts on the highest-volume routes, thus filling a strategic gap in inbound screening defenses."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="In assessing the inbound infection risk to New Mexico from the four origin states, the key metric is the infectious density calculated as (E+I)/Population. Mississippi shows a remarkably high infectious density, with (86386+35563)/6318817 ¡Ö 0.0197 or about 1.97percent. This is substantially higher than the infectious densities of Arizona (~0.017percent), Texas (~0.0017percent), and Virginia (~0.0042percent). Despite Mississippi's relatively low average daily inbound flow into New Mexico (about 1008), the high infectious density means that each traveler from Mississippi has a significantly higher probability of being exposed or infected. By imposing a targeted inbound screening policy on Mississippi travelers, we can intercept and convert 90percent of these hidden infections (E and I) into confirmed cases (Q), effectively reducing the silent importation of infectious individuals into New Mexico. This targeted approach balances risk and operational feasibility by focusing on a key secondary source of infection rather than the larger but less dense flows from Arizona or Texas, which may already be monitored or targeted by other jurisdictions. This strategy thus fills a critical gap in regional disease control, preventing a non-obvious but high-risk importation route from undermining New Mexico's epidemic control efforts over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The decision to implement targeted inbound screening from Mississippi stems from a detailed risk and utility analysis. Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density among the origin states, calculated as (E+I)/Population. With E=86386 and I=35563 out of a population approximately summing to 429300+86386+35563+25082+206487+4641=~792459, the infectious density is roughly 15.1percent, significantly higher than Arizona (~2.7percent), New Mexico (~0.4percent), and Virginia (~1.6percent). This high infectious density indicates a substantial hidden infectious reservoir. Considering the average daily inbound flow from Mississippi to Texas is 38,606, screening here can effectively intercept a significant number of exposed and infected individuals. By enforcing a 90percent screening and conversion of these hidden infections (E and I) into confirmed (Q) upon arrival, Texas can substantially reduce the risk of silent community transmission introduced by travelers from Mississippi. The other states, despite some having higher absolute inflows (Arizona and New Mexico), have markedly lower infectious densities, reducing the marginal benefit of screening. Additionally, focusing on Mississippi addresses a secondary but critical source of risk, complementing broader regional efforts likely targeting more obvious high-volume states like Arizona and New Mexico. This targeted screening policy balances detection utility and epidemiological impact, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas over the next two weeks by intercepting a disproportionately high-risk origin.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="In evaluating the origin states for targeted inbound screening into Virginia, I considered the infectious density, defined as (E+I)/Population, and the inbound flow volume. Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density among the origins: with E=86386, I=35563, and total population approximately 429300+86386+35563+25082+206487+4641=around 800,000, giving roughly (86386+35563)/~800000 ¡Ö 15.3percent.

While Texas has the highest absolute inbound flow (23877), its infectious density is low. Mississippi's inbound flow to Virginia is 4148 daily, moderate but non-negligible. Implementing a 90percent screening on travelers from Mississippi will effectively capture the majority of exposed and infected individuals before community entry, significantly reducing hidden importation risks. Targeting Mississippi addresses a high-risk yet less obvious source, complementing potential measures that might focus on larger states like Texas or Arizona, thereby filling a gap in regional defense coordination. This approach minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia by intercepting a concentrated infectious population from a smaller but riskier origin, balancing detection utility and resource allocation effectively."
