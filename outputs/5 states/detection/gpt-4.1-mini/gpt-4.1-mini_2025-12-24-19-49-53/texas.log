Arizona, despite having a very large inbound flow (27907), has a lower infectious density, reducing the relative risk. Mississippi's inbound flow is smaller (18479) with moderate infectious density, and New Mexico, while having a smaller population and slightly higher density, has a much larger inflow (84217) but a lower absolute number of infected individuals proportionally. Prioritizing Virginia targets a source with high infection prevalence and notable mobility into Texas, filling a regional defense gap. This approach balances detection utility and importation risk, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Texas more effectively than screening from other states.

Despite Mississippi's notably high infectious density, its average daily inbound flow into Texas is relatively low at 28,922 compared to Virginia's 25,030 and New Mexico's 134,761. However, New Mexico's infectious density is very low, diminishing its risk profile. Virginia combines a moderately high infectious density with a substantial inbound flow, resulting in a significant potential importation of hidden infections. Implementing targeted inbound screening for travelers from Virginia would likely capture and convert a large number of exposed and infected individuals (hidden infections) into confirmed cases (Q), thereby reducing silent community spread. The 90% screening mandate on Virginia arrivals will effectively cut down the hidden infectious population entering Texas from this state. Coordination versus competition considerations suggest that while Mississippi's high infectious density is concerning, its lower mobility volume limits the overall risk, and New Mexico's low density reduces its threat. Arizona's infectious density and flow are notable but slightly less critical than Virginia's combined risk. Targeting Virginia fills a critical gap in regional defense against importation risk from a populous, moderately infectious source with significant mobility to Texas. Therefore, the chosen policy maximizes detection utility and systemic risk reduction over the 14-day horizon."

This very high infectious density signals a significant risk of importing hidden infections into Texas. Although Arizona has a larger population and higher absolute numbers, its infectious density is much lower (~0.014). New Mexico and Virginia have lower infectious densities (~0.0013 and ~0.013 respectively). The inbound flow from Mississippi to Texas averages 28,405 daily, which is substantial but smaller than New Mexico's flow (129,254) and Arizona's flow (42,590). Despite this, Mississippi's extremely high infectious density means even this moderate flow likely carries a disproportionate number of exposed and infected individuals. Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy on Mississippi would rigorously screen 90% of incoming travelers, converting most hidden infections to confirmed cases (Q), thus effectively reducing the silent seeding of new cases in Texas. This action addresses a critical gap in regional defense by targeting a secondary but extremely high-risk source, rather than competing for the obvious high-volume but lower-risk states like New Mexico or Arizona. Consequently, this targeted measure optimizes detection utility and minimizes cumulative infections and deaths over the next two weeks by blocking a highly infectious import route without overextending resources on lower-risk origins."

Considering the average daily inbound flow from Mississippi to Texas is 38,606, screening here can effectively intercept a significant number of exposed and infected individuals. By enforcing a 90% screening and conversion of these hidden infections (E and I) into confirmed (Q) upon arrival, Texas can substantially reduce the risk of silent community transmission introduced by travelers from Mississippi. The other states, despite some having higher absolute inflows (Arizona and New Mexico), have markedly lower infectious densities, reducing the marginal benefit of screening. Additionally, focusing on Mississippi addresses a secondary but critical source of risk, complementing broader regional efforts likely targeting more obvious high-volume states like Arizona and New Mexico.
