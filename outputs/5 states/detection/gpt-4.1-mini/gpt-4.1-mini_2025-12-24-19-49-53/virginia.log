This yields an infectious density of about 13.1%, significantly exceeding that of Arizona (~0.7%), New Mexico (~0.1%), and Texas (~0.06%). Despite its smaller population, Mississippi¨s elevated infectious density represents a critical importation risk. The inbound flow from Mississippi to Virginia is moderate at 3545 daily travelers, making it a feasible target for screening without overwhelming logistical capacity. By enforcing a 90% screening and detection mandate for travelers from Mississippi, a large proportion of exposed and infected individuals entering Virginia would be identified and quarantined immediately, substantially reducing hidden infectious seeding. While Texas has the highest absolute flow to Virginia (21662), its infectious density is low, limiting the incremental benefit of screening there. Arizona has a higher infectious density than Texas but lower than Mississippi and a large flow; however, the risk concentration is still lower. Targeting Mississippi fills a niche in regional defense by addressing a high-risk, moderate-flow source that might be overlooked if only the largest flows or states with moderate infection rates are considered. This approach balances risk reduction and operational feasibility to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two weeks."

2025-12-24 19:57:26,381 - virginia - INFO - Parsed PolicyResponse: policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the given origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, with E=69518 and I=26797 over a population roughly summing to S+E+I+Q+R+D = 470801+69518+26797+16145+153675+4020 = approximately 724956. This yields an infectious density of about 13.1percent, significantly exceeding that of Arizona (~0.7percent), New Mexico (~0.1percent), and Texas (~0.06percent). Despite its smaller population, Mississippi¨s elevated infectious density represents a critical importation risk. The inbound flow from Mississippi to Virginia is moderate at 3545 daily travelers, making it a feasible target for screening without overwhelming logistical capacity. By enforcing a 90percent screening and detection mandate for travelers from Mississippi, a large proportion of exposed and infected individuals entering Virginia would be identified and quarantined immediately, substantially reducing hidden infectious seeding. While Texas has the highest absolute flow to Virginia (21662), its infectious density is low, limiting the incremental benefit of screening there. Arizona has a higher infectious density than Texas but lower than Mississippi and a large flow; however, the risk concentration is still lower. Targeting Mississippi fills a niche in regional defense by addressing a high-risk, moderate-flow source that might be overlooked if only the largest flows or states with moderate infection rates are considered. This approach balances risk reduction and operational feasibility to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two weeks.'

  "global_guidance": "Among the provided origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density with a combined exposed and infected population of 120,839 out of a total population of approximately 435,534+86086+34753+21195+176925+4317, resulting in a notably high (E+I)/Population ratio. This indicates a significant hidden infectious burden relative to its population size. Mississippi's average daily inbound flow into Virginia is 3,183, which, while lower than other states, still represents a meaningful vector for disease importation. Screening travelers from Mississippi with a 90% detection rate of exposed and infected individuals would substantially reduce the introduction of hidden infections into Virginia, converting a large portion of these cases directly to confirmed status (Q) and enabling proper isolation and treatment. Arizona and Texas, despite having higher absolute inbound flows, have lower infectious densities relative to their populations, and New Mexico has both low infectious density and low flow. Targeting Mississippi fills a strategic regional gap, as it is a secondary source with elevated risk often overlooked compared to higher flow states. By focusing on Mississippi, Virginia can effectively mitigate a disproportionate risk source, complementing broader regional efforts and avoiding redundant screening on states with lower relative infectious risk. Hence, the recommended policy is to implement targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi for the upcoming 14 days."
