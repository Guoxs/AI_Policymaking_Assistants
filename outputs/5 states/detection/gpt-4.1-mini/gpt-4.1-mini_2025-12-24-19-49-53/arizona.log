Although New Mexico has a slightly higher infectious density (~0.001), Virginia¨s absolute numbers of exposed and infected individuals (1825 E and 3189 I) combined with a substantial inbound flow (3171 daily travelers) pose a significant threat of importing hidden infections. Targeting Virginia for the 90% screening mandate will likely intercept a larger absolute number of hidden infectious travelers and reduce the seeding of new cases in Arizona. Screening would convert approximately 90% of the exposed and infected travelers from Virginia into confirmed cases upon arrival, effectively diminishing the silent community spread potential. While Texas has the largest daily inflow (22661) and is an obvious high-volume source, its lower infectious density and smaller E+I counts reduce the per-traveler risk. New Mexico, despite higher flow and infection density, is smaller in absolute infectious counts. Coordinating with other states potentially focusing on Texas or New Mexico, prioritizing Virginia fills a niche in regional defense by addressing a moderate flow but high infection-load source, thereby optimizing risk reduction under the single-state screening policy constraint. No restrictions on other states preserve mobility while focusing resources on the highest-impact source, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona over the next 14 days."

This elevated infectious density signals a substantial risk of importing hidden infections into Arizona. Mississippi's average daily inbound flow to Arizona is 1918, smaller than Texas and New Mexico but still significant. Implementing targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi would capture approximately 90% of the exposed and infected individuals arriving, effectively converting a large portion of hidden infections into confirmed cases (Q) upon arrival and reducing silent community spread. Although Texas has a larger absolute inbound flow (47112) and Virginia has a moderate infectious density, their lower infection prevalence and the dilutive effect of their large populations reduce the relative risk per traveler. New Mexico has a high inbound flow but very low infectious density, making screening less impactful there. Selecting Mississippi targets the most infectious and high-risk origin state that may be under-addressed by other agents, filling a critical gap in regional epidemic defense. This focused approach balances resource use and maximizes impact in reducing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona over the 14-day horizon."

  "global_guidance": "The decision to implement targeted inbound screening from Mississippi is driven primarily by its exceptionally high infectious density and the potential impact of screening there. Mississippi's infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, is approximately (86086+34753)/6630556 = 0.0181 or 1.81%, significantly higher than other origin states: New Mexico (~0.0012), Texas (~0.0014), and Virginia (~0.0135). Despite having a relatively lower inbound flow to Arizona (1900 daily), the high proportion of hidden infections (E and I) entering from Mississippi means that rigorous screening capturing 90% of these cases would substantially reduce the number of exposed and infected travelers entering Arizona undetected. This screening will convert these hidden infections directly into confirmed cases (Q), enabling immediate isolation and reducing onward transmission. Choosing Mississippi also reflects a strategic coordination decision: while Texas and New Mexico have higher inbound flows, their infectious densities are much lower, making screening there less efficient in reducing importation risk. Virginia has a moderately high infectious density but a smaller inbound flow compared to Texas and New Mexico. By focusing on Mississippi, Arizona targets a high-risk, less obvious source that might be under-monitored by other states or agencies, thus filling a gap in regional defense and maximizing the marginal benefit of screening resources. This targeted approach aligns with the objective to minimize cumulative cases and deaths by efficiently intercepting a high-risk population segment with a manageable screening burden."
