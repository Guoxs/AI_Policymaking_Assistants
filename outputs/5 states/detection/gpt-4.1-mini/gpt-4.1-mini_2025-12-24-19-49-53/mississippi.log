Arizona has 15,605 exposed and 997 infected individuals in a population of approximately 8,588,251, yielding an infectious density of about 0.00195. This is higher than New Mexico (0.00028), Texas (0.00021), and Virginia (0.00236).

Implementing a 90% rigorous screening on Arizona travelers will effectively convert a large portion of these hidden infections into confirmed cases (Q), significantly reducing the risk of undetected importation into Mississippi. While Virginia has a comparable infectious density, the lower flow limits the overall number of infected arrivals. Texas has the highest inbound flow by far (63,448 daily) but a much lower infectious density, reducing the utility of a targeted screening. New Mexico has both low infectious density and low flow, making it less critical. Choosing Arizona targets a high infectious density source with moderate flow, filling a critical gap in regional defense that might be overlooked if only focusing on the highest-volume or highest-density states.

Texas and New Mexico have much lower infectious densities, around 0.00027 and 0.00041 respectively.

Although Texas has the largest inflow, its infectious density is low, limiting the hidden infection risk. Virginia, however, balances a relatively high infectious density with a moderate inflow, posing a meaningful risk of introducing hidden infections. Screening at Virginia's entry points is estimated to identify 90% of these hidden infections (E+I), effectively reducing importation of undetected cases into Mississippi and thus lowering cumulative cases and deaths. Choosing Virginia over Arizona, despite Arizona's high infectious density, is justified by Virginia's higher infected count and inflow, providing a better targeted intervention. This decision complements other states' likely focus on the largest inflow sources like Texas, filling a regional defense gap by addressing a secondary but significant risk source. Hence, implementing targeted inbound screening for travelers from Virginia for the next 14 days maximizes detection utility and minimizes epidemic importation risk to Mississippi."

This is significantly higher than Virginia (~1.2%), New Mexico (~0.1%), and Texas (~0.0006%). Arizona also has a substantial inbound flow to Mississippi at 2086 daily travelers. Targeting Arizona for inbound screening would allow rigorous 90% detection of hidden infectious travelers (E and I), substantially reducing the imported hidden infections that fuel local spread.

While Virginia also has a notable infectious density and inbound flow, Arizona's slightly higher infectious prevalence and comparable flow make it the more impactful choice.

Choosing Arizona addresses the largest single source of infection importation, prioritizing systemic risk reduction rather than splitting efforts on lower-risk states.

This would significantly reduce hidden seeding of infections in Mississippi. Arizona, despite a similar infectious density, has a smaller inflow, making its absolute importation risk lower. New Mexico and Texas have much lower infectious densities, making their import risks less concerning. Targeting Virginia balances the need to address a high-risk source with substantial travel volume, filling a critical gap in regional defense without overlapping excessively with expected policies focused on Arizona or Texas. Thus, enforcing rigorous screening on inbound travelers from Virginia for the next two weeks is the optimal strategy to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi."
