However, the very high infectious density in Mississippi means that even small inflows carry substantial risk. By targeting Mississippi for inbound screening, the policy captures approximately 90% of exposed and infected individuals arriving from the highest-risk state, converting them to confirmed cases (Q) and thus preventing hidden community transmission chains. This targeted approach supplements regional defenses by addressing a secondary but disproportionately risky source that might be overlooked if focus remained on higher-volume but lower-density states like Texas or Arizona. Screening Mississippi travelers balances resource allocation effectively, minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico, and fills a gap in multi-state epidemic control efforts, rather than competing by focusing only on the largest inflows. Therefore, imposing a targeted inbound screening on Mississippi optimally mitigates importation risks over the next 14 days."

  "global_guidance": "Assessing the infectious density of each origin state relative to its population and inflow into New Mexico reveals critical insights. Mississippi exhibits a notably high infectious density with (E+I) at 120,412 over a population of approximately 863,000, yielding an infectious density of about 13.95%. This is substantially higher than Arizona (~1.42%), Texas (~0.12%), and Virginia (~1.38%). Although Mississippi's inbound flow to New Mexico is low (~1,129 daily), the high density of hidden infections (E and I) means even small inflows risk substantial seeding of new cases. Targeting Mississippi allows intercepting a large fraction of these hidden infections through rigorous 90% screening, effectively converting exposed and infected travelers into confirmed cases (Q) upon arrival, sharply reducing undetected importations. This choice balances risk and practicality: while Arizona and Texas have much higher absolute inflows, their infectious densities are lower, diluting the per-traveler risk. Screening Mississippi fills a regional defense gap by controlling a high-risk but less-obvious source that might be overlooked by other states focusing on more populous neighbors. This targeted intervention minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks by preemptively quarantining a disproportionate share of incoming hidden infections from a high-risk origin, optimizing limited resources for maximal epidemic control impact."
