Choosing Virginia balances targeting a high-risk source with meaningful travel volume, filling a regional defense gap since other agents might prioritize more populous Texas or Arizona.

This targeted intervention focuses on a secondary but highly infectious origin rather than the obvious largest flow source Texas, which has a lower infectious density but much higher volume; targeting Virginia complements broader regional defense efforts by filling a gap that might be overlooked if only volume-based restrictions were considered. This balanced approach minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by prioritizing effective screening where the infection risk per traveler is highest, while avoiding the systemic disruption of restricting flows from the largest traffic source.

Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density, slightly exceeding Arizona, indicating a significant hidden infectious risk per capita. Looking at inbound flows to Mississippi, Texas contributes the largest daily flow (~35,978), followed by Arizona (~2,086), Virginia (~4,247), and New Mexico (~1,158). While Texas has the largest volume, its infectious density is relatively low, thus its risk per traveler is lower. Virginia presents a moderate inbound flow coupled with the highest infectious density, making it a prime candidate for targeted screening. Implementing the 90% screening policy on Virginia travelers would capture approximately 90% of the exposed and infected individuals from this group, substantially reducing the hidden infectious population entering Mississippi. Choosing Virginia balances targeting a high per capita risk source with a moderate flow, filling a regional defense gap without overlapping the likely focus on Arizona or Texas by other states or agencies. Arizona, despite a similar infectious density to Virginia, has a much smaller inbound flow to Mississippi, reducing its overall impact. New Mexico's low infectious density and flow make it a less effective target. Therefore, restricting Virginia inbound travelers with enhanced screening is optimal to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next 14 days."

  "global_guidance": "Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state highlights Arizona as having the highest risk import profile: Arizona's infectious density is approximately (114512+7278)/(8522698+114512+7278+167737+247028+5133)=~0.013 (about 1.3%), which is higher than New Mexico (~0.0013), Texas (~0.0011), and Virginia (~0.014 but with a smaller inflow). Moreover, Arizona's average daily inbound flow into Mississippi is 2050, which, while smaller than Texas, still represents a significant potential vector for importation of hidden infectious individuals. Applying a rigorous 90% screening on Arizona travelers would effectively detect and quarantine a substantial fraction of exposed and infected individuals, significantly reducing the hidden infectious import into Mississippi. Texas, despite its massive inflow (35622), has a notably lower infectious density, so screening there yields less marginal benefit relative to operational cost and feasibility. Virginia has a moderate infectious density but lower inflow. New Mexico's infectious density and inflow are both low, rendering screening less impactful. Targeting Arizona is a strategic choice balancing risk and impact: it addresses a high infectious density source with moderate inflow, filling a critical gap in regional defenses. This targeted inbound screening reduces Mississippi's imported hidden infections, thus minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths over the 14-day horizon. Hence, Arizona is selected for the targeted inbound screening policy to optimize disease control outcomes."

Arizona's daily inbound flow into Mississippi is moderate (1891), which means implementing targeted screening there can effectively reduce imported hidden infections without overwhelming resource allocation. The detection utility from Arizona¨s travelers is substantial; screening 90% of inbound travelers from Arizona would convert a large fraction of exposed and infected individuals into confirmed cases, thus preventing silent community spread. While Virginia also has a high infectious density, its inbound flow is lower (4629) and infectious density slightly lower than Arizona, making Arizona the more critical source to target. Texas and New Mexico show much lower infectious densities despite higher or comparable flows, yielding less impact from screening. Choosing Arizona addresses the most obvious high-risk source, aligning with regional epidemic control priorities and maximizing reduction of imported infections. This targeted approach balances effective intervention and resource constraints, without unnecessary broad restrictions or duplicating efforts on lower-risk flows, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next two weeks."
