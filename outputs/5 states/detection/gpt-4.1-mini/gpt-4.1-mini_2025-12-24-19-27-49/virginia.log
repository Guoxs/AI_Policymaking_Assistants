Arizona has a lower infectious density (~0.00039), New Mexico (~0.001), and Texas the lowest (~0.000043). Although New Mexico shows a slightly higher infectious density (~0.001), its inbound flow to Virginia is only 1004 daily, significantly less compared to Mississippi's 2401 daily travelers. Mississippi's higher traveler volume combined with a high infectious density makes it a critical source of hidden infections entering Virginia. Implementing targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi will capture approximately 90% of E and I individuals among its 2401 daily inbound travelers, substantially reducing hidden infectious imports. This intervention is efficient because it focuses on a high-risk origin with moderate-to-large flow, optimizing detection utility. While Arizona and Texas have larger populations and flows, their infectious densities are lower, reducing the marginal benefit of screening them. Targeting Mississippi addresses a regional gap in defense where other agents may prioritize more obvious large states like Texas or Arizona, thereby complementing broader coordination efforts rather than competing for the same target. This targeted screening for 14 days will significantly mitigate disease importation risks and help minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia."

Despite Mississippi's relatively lower inbound flow into Virginia (4198 daily) compared to states like Arizona (5493) and Texas (25244), its very high infection prevalence suggests that even modest travel volumes carry a substantial risk of importing hidden infections. Implementing a 90% effective screening policy targeting Mississippi arrivals would convert a large portion of exposed and infected travelers into confirmed cases (Q), effectively reducing the hidden infectious seeding into Virginia. This targeted intervention fills a crucial gap in regional defense by focusing on a secondary, less obvious but high-risk source rather than just the largest-volume states like Texas or Arizona where infection prevalence is lower. Although Texas has the highest inbound flow, its infectious density is much lower, making screening less impactful. Arizona¨s infectious density is intermediate but still much lower than Mississippi¨s. New Mexico has both low inbound flow and low infectious density, thus minimal impact if targeted. Therefore, prioritizing Mississippi for inbound screening balances detection utility and risk reduction, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia over the next 14 days."

2025-12-24 19:35:18,714 - virginia - INFO - Parsed PolicyResponse: policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the origin states, Mississippi presents the highest infectious density calculated as (E+I)/Population, with 69,451 exposed and 26,822 infected individuals out of a population roughly estimated at 469,213 + 69,451 + 26,822 + 16,139 + 153,576 + 4,017 「 739,218, yielding an infectious density of approximately 13.2percent. This is significantly higher than Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, which have much larger populations diluting their E+I counts, resulting in lower infectious densities. Moreover, the daily inbound flow from Mississippi to Virginia is 3,545, which, while lower than Texas (21,662) and Arizona (4,496), still represents a meaningful vector of potential disease importation. The screening¨s detection utility is high here because rigorous 90percent screening will convert a substantial fraction of these hidden infections into confirmed cases (Q), effectively reducing the risk of covert transmission within Virginia. Targeting Mississippi fills a critical gap in regional defense by focusing on a smaller but highly infectious source state that might be overlooked due to its lower absolute flow compared to Texas or Arizona. This approach optimizes the benefit of limited screening resources by addressing a disproportionately high-risk origin rather than competing on the obvious but lower relative risk large states. Therefore, we recommend implementing targeted inbound screening on Mississippi for the next 14 days to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia.'

Mississippi exhibits a very high infectious density with (E+I) = 85761 + 34651 = 120412 out of a total population of approximately 432417 + 85761 + 34651 + 21182 + 176825 + 4314 「 724150, resulting in an infectious density of around 16.6%, the highest among the candidate states. In contrast, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas show much lower infectious densities: Arizona about 1.3%, New Mexico about 0.13%, and Texas about 0.01%. Given this stark difference, Mississippi poses the greatest risk of importing hidden infections. Daily inbound flow from Mississippi to Virginia is 3183 travelers, which, while smaller than Texas (20129) or Arizona (4029), is still significant. By screening 90% of arrivals from Mississippi and converting exposed and infected travelers directly to confirmed and isolated status, the policy can effectively intercept a substantial portion of hidden infection importations. This targeted approach focuses on a high-risk but moderate flow source, filling a gap in regional defense where others might prioritize high-volume but much lower prevalence states like Texas. This strategy balances detection utility and resource allocation efficiently, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two weeks. Notably, no other state has such a high infectious density combined with a non-negligible inbound flow, justifying Mississippi as the optimal choice for targeted inbound screening."
