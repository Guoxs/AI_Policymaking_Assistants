 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density ((E+I)/Population) of the origin states, Virginia stands out with the highest infectious density of approximately 0.00058 (5014 infectious individuals over ~8.52 million), compared to Mississippi (~0.00088), New Mexico (~0.001), and Texas (~0.00004). However, despite New Mexico's slightly higher infectious density (~0.001), its inbound flow to Arizona is significantly larger (14511 daily), but the actual number of infectious individuals arriving from Virginia (3171 inflow * 5014 infectious/8.52M population ¡Ö 1.87 infectious individuals daily) is still notable. Texas and Mississippi contribute less infectious individuals due to lower infectious density or smaller inflow. The screening mandate targeting Virginia travelers will rigorously identify and convert 90percent of exposed and infected individuals entering Arizona from Virginia into confirmed cases, effectively reducing hidden infections entering the community. Selecting Virginia targets a major risk source with a moderate inflow and a high infectious prevalence, filling a gap that might be overlooked if focusing on sheer volume (like New Mexico or Texas). This approach balances detection utility with systemic risk, potentially limiting importation-driven outbreaks without overextending resources. Therefore, restricting and screening inbound travel from Virginia for 14 days optimally minimizes cumulative infections and deaths in Arizona."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population approximately 0.00058, calculated from E=1825 and I=3189 over a population around 9,520,000. Although Texas has a larger population, its infectious density is much lower (~0.00004). Arizona and New Mexico have moderate infectious densities around 0.00038 and 0.00099 respectively, but their daily inbound flows to Mississippi are smaller compared to Virginia and Texas. Importantly, Virginia's daily inbound flow to Mississippi is 2260, which is significant and could contribute to importation of hidden infections. Screening 90percent of inbound travelers from Virginia would convert a substantial portion of exposed and infected individuals (estimated around 0.9 * (E+I) * daily inflow / population) into confirmed cases upon arrival, reducing community transmission risk. Choosing Virginia balances targeting a high-risk source with meaningful travel volume, filling a regional defense gap since other agents might prioritize more populous Texas or Arizona. Texas, despite higher flow, has much lower infectious density, and Arizona's flow is lower. Hence, restricting inbound travelers from Virginia with rigorous screening optimizes the detection utility and minimizes imported hidden infections, effectively reducing cumulative cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next two weeks."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Analyzing the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals that Virginia has the highest infectious density at approximately 0.00059, followed by Mississippi at 0.00091 but with much lower inbound flow, Texas at 0.00004, and Arizona at 0.00004. Despite Arizona and Texas having very large absolute flows into New Mexico (19,529 and 47,170 daily respectively), their infectious densities are relatively low. Mississippi has a moderate infectious density but a very low daily inbound flow (942), limiting its impact on case importation. Virginia, while having a smaller inbound flow (1,385 daily), has a notably higher proportion of hidden infections (E+I), which makes its travelers a concentrated risk source. Implementing a 90percent screening and detection mandate for inbound travelers from Virginia will effectively convert a significant portion of these hidden infections into confirmed cases upon arrival, thus preventing them from seeding new chains of transmission in New Mexico. Targeting Virginia fills a regional defense gap by addressing a high-risk but less obvious source of infection, complementing broader policies that might focus on higher-volume but lower-risk states such as Texas and Arizona. This targeted approach balances the objectives of minimizing imported infectious individuals while avoiding excessive disruption to higher-volume but lower-risk flows, optimizing public health outcomes over the next 14 days.'

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state, Virginia has the highest infection density among the provided states. Virginia's exposed (1825) plus infected (3189) totals 5014 cases out of a population of 8,524,995, yielding an infectious density of approximately 0.000588, which is higher than Arizona (~0.000394), Mississippi (~0.000885 but with much smaller inflow), and New Mexico (~0.00101 but with moderate inflow). However, Virginia's absolute infectious population combined with its daily inbound flow of about 13,780 travelers to Texas results in the largest influx of potentially infectious individuals. By implementing a targeted inbound screening policy on travelers from Virginia, we can capture 90percent of the exposed and infected individuals entering Texas, significantly reducing the hidden infectious population crossing the border. This intervention captures the highest number of hidden infections due to the combination of a relatively high infection density and a substantial travel volume, thereby minimizing the risk of seeding new infections in Texas. Choosing Virginia over others strategically fills a critical gap since other states like New Mexico have moderate infectious density but higher inflows, yet their infectious population is smaller in absolute terms. Mississippi, despite having a high infectious density, has a far lower inflow to Texas, limiting the policy impact. Arizona has a large population but lower infectious density and a smaller inflow to Texas. Thus, targeting Virginia aligns with maximizing detection utility and systemic risk reduction, even if other agents may focus on states with high infection densities but lower travel volume. Overall, this focused screening on Virginia inbound travelers for the next 14 days best balances infection importation risk and policy effectiveness to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi presents the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population approximately 0.00088, calculated from E=906 and I=1753 over a population of roughly 2,970,629. Arizona has a lower infectious density (~0.00039), New Mexico (~0.001), and Texas the lowest (~0.000043). Although New Mexico shows a slightly higher infectious density (~0.001), its inbound flow to Virginia is only 1004 daily, significantly less compared to Mississippi's 2401 daily travelers. Mississippi's higher traveler volume combined with a high infectious density makes it a critical source of hidden infections entering Virginia. Implementing targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi will capture approximately 90percent of E and I individuals among its 2401 daily inbound travelers, substantially reducing hidden infectious imports. This intervention is efficient because it focuses on a high-risk origin with moderate-to-large flow, optimizing detection utility. While Arizona and Texas have larger populations and flows, their infectious densities are lower, reducing the marginal benefit of screening them. Targeting Mississippi addresses a regional gap in defense where other agents may prioritize more obvious large states like Texas or Arizona, thereby complementing broader coordination efforts rather than competing for the same target. This targeted screening for 14 days will significantly mitigate disease importation risks and help minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Analyzing the infectious risk from the origin states based on the infectious density (E+I)/Population, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density with (3320+1783)/5486976 ¡Ö 0.00094, notably higher than New Mexico at (715+153)/3323857 ¡Ö 0.00026, Texas at (787+1223)/48379264 ¡Ö 0.00004, and Virginia at (4043+983)/13217229 ¡Ö 0.00038. Despite Texas having the largest inbound flow to Arizona (27,201 daily), its infectious density is low, reducing the relative risk per traveler. Mississippi, with a moderate inbound flow of 1,524 but significantly higher infectious density, presents a concentrated risk of importing hidden infections. Implementing targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi would identify and quarantine approximately 90percent of exposed and infected individuals entering Arizona from this source, effectively converting these hidden cases into confirmed cases (Q), thereby reducing silent community transmission. This intervention fills a critical gap as other states with higher flows have lower infectious density, and focusing on Mississippi complements rather than duplicates efforts that may be taken by other states or agents targeting higher-volume states. The approach prioritizes risk per capita over sheer traveler volume, maximizing the impact of screening resources to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona over the next two weeks.'

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the origin states, Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population approximately (4043+983)/~13,000,000 ¡Ö 0.039percent, which is notably higher than Texas (~0.007percent), Arizona (~0.034percent), and New Mexico (~0.035percent). Virginia also contributes a substantial average daily inbound flow of 3005 travelers into Mississippi, which is significant though lower than Texas (31103). Screening travelers from Virginia will identify and quarantine 90percent of the hidden infectious individuals (E and I) arriving from this moderately high-risk source, effectively reducing the importation of undetected infections. Targeting Virginia balances risk mitigation and resource allocation by focusing on a secondary yet substantial source of infection rather than the largest inflow Texas, which has comparatively lower infectious density. This approach complements potential policies by other states targeting Texas, thus filling a regional defense gap and minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi. Hence, implementing targeted inbound screening for Virginia travelers over the next 14 days is a strategic and efficient containment measure.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density (defined as (E+I)/Population) of origin states reveals that Mississippi poses the highest risk despite its smaller inbound flow compared to Texas or Arizona. Mississippi's combined exposed and infected total is 5103 out of approximately 7,992,767 population (sum of all compartments), yielding an infectious density of approximately 0.000638, higher than Texas (~0.000070) and Arizona (~0.000041), and somewhat comparable to Virginia (~0.000585). Although Texas has the highest inbound flow into New Mexico (69,252 daily), its infectious density is substantially lower, implying fewer hidden infections per traveler. Screening travelers from Mississippi, who have an average daily inflow of 1,230 into New Mexico, can effectively intercept a significant fraction of hidden infections. The 90percent rigorous inbound screening converts these hidden cases from E and I into Q, reducing silent transmission chains and thus cumulative cases and deaths. This targeted approach fills a gap in regional defense by addressing a secondary but highly infectious source, complementing likely screening efforts elsewhere focused on larger states like Texas or Arizona. Choosing Mississippi balances the trade-off between importation volume and infectious density, maximizing detection utility while minimizing systemic risks. Hence, implementing targeted inbound screening for Mississippi travelers is the optimal intervention for the next 14 days."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density (E+I)/Population for origin states reveals that Virginia has the highest infectious density at approximately 0.0592percent ((4043+983)/8525943), followed by Mississippi at about 0.17percent ((3320+1783)/2925416), Arizona at roughly 0.04percent ((2857+185)/7365717), and New Mexico at about 0.036percent ((715+153)/2396032). However, the absolute inbound flows into Texas differ significantly: New Mexico contributes the largest average daily inflow (117,318), followed by Arizona (33,181), Mississippi (24,904), and Virginia (16,423). To estimate detection utility, we multiply the hidden infected travelers (E+I) by the inbound flow and the 90percent screening efficacy. Virginia's combination of a relatively high infectious density and a non-negligible inbound flow results in a substantial number of hidden infections intercepted and converted to confirmed cases¡ªhigher than other states when factoring both infectious density and flow. Targeting Virginia addresses a critical regional source that may be underprioritized by others focusing on more obvious high inflows like New Mexico or Arizona. This choice balances risk reduction and coordination, focusing on a moderately sized but high-risk source to complement broader regional defense. Thus, imposing targeted inbound screening on travelers from Virginia for 14 days maximizes the reduction of imported hidden infectious individuals into Texas, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths effectively."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals Mississippi as the highest risk source for inbound infection into Virginia. Mississippi's infectious density is approximately (3320+1783)/2925416 ¡Ö 0.00174, substantially higher than Arizona (~0.00042), New Mexico (~0.00036), and Texas (~0.00007). This indicates a greater proportion of hidden infections entering Virginia from Mississippi. Considering the average daily inbound flow from Mississippi to Virginia is 3440 travelers, applying a 90percent screening and detection policy will identify and convert the majority of hidden infections (E and I) into confirmed cases (Q), significantly reducing the risk of undetected importations that fuel local transmission. Targeting Mississippi is strategic because although Texas has the highest volume of travelers (15325 daily), its infectious density is much lower, resulting in fewer hidden infections per traveler. Arizona and New Mexico have moderate flows but lower infection prevalence. This targeted approach prioritizes the highest infectious density source with meaningful traveler volume, maximizing detection utility and minimizing importation risk. While other agents might focus on large volume states like Texas, this policy fills a critical regional gap by controlling a secondary but higher-risk source, enhancing collective epidemic defense. Given Virginia's current moderate local infection levels, preventing additional importation from Mississippi will help dampen epidemic growth effectively over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population = (5704+2648)/5834803 ¡Ö 0.00143, which is notably higher than New Mexico (~0.00029), Texas (~0.00010), and Virginia (~0.00076). This elevated infectious density indicates a larger proportion of hidden infections potentially entering Arizona. Mississippi's average daily inflow into Arizona is 1474 travelers, which is moderate compared to Texas and New Mexico but still significant. Implementing targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi would capture approximately 90percent of the exposed and infected individuals arriving, effectively converting these hidden cases into confirmed and isolated cases (Q compartment), substantially reducing community seeding events. While Texas and New Mexico have much higher traveler volumes, their infectious densities are substantially lower, making their risk per traveler less acute. Virginia's infectious density is intermediate but its inbound flow is relatively low. Targeting Mississippi addresses a high-risk source often overlooked compared to larger states like Texas, thereby complementing regional defense efforts and avoiding duplication of controls heavily focused on high-volume but lower-risk origins. This focused approach balances risk reduction with practical resource allocation, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona over the next two weeks."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density for each origin state, Virginia exhibits the highest combined ratio of exposed and infected individuals relative to its population, with (E+I)/Population approximately 0.00075, compared to Arizona (~0.000056), New Mexico (~0.00028), and Texas (~0.000098). Despite Texas having a high absolute number of infected individuals, its infectious density is lower than Virginia's. Considering inbound flow into Mississippi, Texas contributes the largest volume of travelers (~32701 daily), but its infectious density is comparatively lower, which reduces per capita risk. Virginia's moderate inbound flow (~2877 daily) combined with a relatively higher infectious density presents a significant risk of importing hidden infections. Targeting Virginia for rigorous 90percent screening will effectively identify and quarantine a substantial fraction of exposed and infected travelers, reducing the hidden infectious pool entering Mississippi. This approach fills a critical gap in regional defense by focusing on a secondary yet high-risk source that might be overlooked if only the largest volume state (Texas) is targeted. Arizona and New Mexico have both lower infectious densities and inbound flows, making their risk profiles less urgent. Therefore, selecting Virginia balances risk reduction and resource allocation, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, Mississippi exhibits the highest ratio among the origin states: (5704+2648)/approximately 11.27 million total population, yielding roughly 0.74¡ë, significantly above others. Arizona's infectious density is approximately (3999+253)/around 7.5 million, about 0.57¡ë; Texas stands at (1076+1674)/~29 million, about 0.09¡ë; Virginia shows (5186+1207)/~9.7 million, around 0.67¡ë. Mississippi's elevated infectious density, combined with its consistent, though smaller, inbound flow to New Mexico (1233 daily), creates a non-negligible hidden infection importation risk. Implementing targeted inbound screening on Mississippi travelers will identify and quarantine 90percent of exposed and infected arrivals, significantly reducing the latent infectious population entering New Mexico and mitigating spread. Although Texas and Arizona have higher absolute traveler volumes, their lower infectious densities dilute the risk per traveler, and the scale of logistical challenges and resource allocation for screening such large flows is substantial. Targeting Mississippi offers a strategic intervention that complements regional defense by addressing a high-risk secondary source often overlooked by others focusing on larger states. This focused approach balances detection utility and operational feasibility, reducing cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals that Mississippi exhibits the highest infection pressure relative to its population, with (5704+2648)/approximately 11,716,927 total population components, yielding a notably high infectious density compared to Arizona, New Mexico, and Virginia. Despite Mississippi's smaller total population, its elevated exposed and infected counts combined with a significant daily inbound flow to Texas (26,190) imply a substantial risk of importing hidden infections. Implementing targeted inbound screening from Mississippi allows detection and conversion of approximately 90percent of exposed and infected travelers into confirmed (Q) cases upon arrival, effectively reducing undetected infectious individuals entering Texas. This policy fills a critical gap by focusing on a secondary but high-risk source state rather than the obvious largest inflow states like New Mexico or Arizona, which have lower infectious densities or larger populations diluting their risk. Therefore, prioritizing Mississippi balances risk mitigation and resource allocation, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Texas by intercepting a concentrated infectious inflow from a high-risk origin, complementing broader regional efforts without redundancy."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The decision to implement targeted inbound screening from Mississippi is based on a detailed risk assessment balancing infectious density, traveler volume, and strategic coordination. Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density among origin states, calculated as (E+I)/Population = (5704+2648)/approx. 9,716,167 = ~0.00086, significantly exceeding other states such as Arizona (~0.00044), New Mexico (~0.00028), and Texas (~0.00010). Although Texas has the largest absolute inbound flow into Virginia (15,964 daily), its lower infectious density reduces relative risk per traveler. Mississippi¡¯s inbound flow into Virginia is moderate (3,303 daily), yet the high ratio of hidden infections (E+I) combined with this flow means a substantial number of potentially infectious travelers could be entering. By enforcing a 90percent screening and conversion of exposed/infected individuals to confirmed cases (Q), Virginia effectively intercepts a large fraction of hidden infections from Mississippi, significantly lowering imported disease burden. This targeted approach fills a regional defense gap by focusing on a secondary high-risk source rather than the more obvious Texas, which might be covered by other jurisdictions or policies. Arizona and New Mexico, despite their traveler flows, have lower infectious densities and thus present comparatively less importation risk. Therefore, prioritizing Mississippi balances detection utility with systemic risk reduction, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two weeks.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state highlights Mississippi as the highest risk source. Mississippi's infectious density is approximately (9374+4437)/~11,276,276 = 0.00123, which is significantly higher than that of Texas (~0.00013), Virginia (~0.00096), and New Mexico (~0.00025). Although Texas has the largest inbound flow into Arizona (33,250), its infectious density is lower, reducing its per capita risk contribution. Mississippi¡¯s inbound flow to Arizona is moderate (1,596 daily), but given its high infectious density, each traveler carries a higher risk of importing hidden infections. Implementing targeted inbound screening on Mississippi travelers can effectively capture and quarantine 90percent of exposed and infected individuals before community spread, substantially reducing imported hidden infections. This targeted intervention complements other states¡¯ policies or lack thereof, filling a critical gap in regional disease defense by focusing on a high-risk but less obvious origin compared to Texas or New Mexico, where infection prevalence is lower. The 14-day duration matches the incubation and infectious periods, ensuring meaningful impact on reducing cumulative cases and deaths in Arizona. Given these factors, prioritizing Mississippi for inbound screening maximizes detection utility and systemic risk mitigation without unnecessarily restricting higher-volume but lower-risk states."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the origin states, Texas exhibits the highest absolute counts of exposed (E=1384) and infected (I=2165) individuals, despite its large population (~27.3 million). Its infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, is approximately (1384+2165)/27330374 ¡Ö 0.00013, which is higher than Arizona (~0.00008), Virginia (~0.000095), and New Mexico (~0.00025 but with very low inbound flow). Texas also has the largest inbound flow into Mississippi at 38,622 travelers daily, significantly higher than other states. Screening 90percent of inbound travelers from Texas would likely intercept a substantial number of hidden infections, converting them from E and I to Q status and thus reducing the seeding of new infections in Mississippi. Although New Mexico has a slightly higher infectious density (~0.00024), its inbound flow is much smaller (1984), making its overall importation risk lower. Arizona and Virginia have moderate infectious densities but much lower infectious counts and inbound flow. Targeting Texas balances both source risk and mobility volume, maximizing detection utility. While other agents might also target Texas as an obvious high-risk source, Mississippi¡¯s large inbound flow from Texas makes it a critical control point. This targeted inbound screening policy for Texas over the next 14 days is expected to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by substantially cutting down the hidden infectious influx from the highest risk and highest volume origin, effectively complementing regional epidemic control efforts.'

2025-12-24 19:29:19,578 - od_agent - INFO - Region new mexico policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Analyzing the infectious density, Mississippi shows the highest combined exposed and infected individuals relative to its population, with (E+I)/(Population) approximately 0.00519, significantly surpassing Arizona (~0.00079), Texas (~0.00013), and Virginia (~0.00095). Despite having a relatively low average daily inbound flow into New Mexico (1241 travelers), the high infectious density implies that each traveler from Mississippi carries a higher risk of importing hidden infections. Implementing targeted inbound screening for Mississippi travelers can efficiently intercept a substantial fraction of these hidden cases, converting 90percent of exposed and infected arrivals into confirmed cases upon entry, thus drastically reducing undetected infectious introductions. While Texas contributes the largest absolute volume of travelers, its much lower infectious density reduces the marginal benefit of screening there. Targeting Mississippi addresses a secondary but high-risk source, filling a gap in regional defense which others might overlook due to volume bias. This approach balances detection utility and systemic risk reduction, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks by focusing on the highest per-capita infection risk among inbound states rather than sheer traveler numbers alone.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density with (9374+4437)/2737720 ¡Ö 0.00495, significantly higher than Arizona (~0.00079), New Mexico (~0.00025), and Virginia (~0.00096). Despite Mississippi's smaller absolute population and inbound flow to Texas (30835 daily) relative to New Mexico (136934) and Arizona (41317), the elevated infectious density signals a higher risk of importing hidden infections. Targeting Mississippi with the 90percent screening mandate will convert a substantial portion of exposed and infected inbound travelers into confirmed cases upon arrival, effectively reducing the number of undetected carriers entering Texas. This intervention addresses a critical regional gap, as other states with larger flows but lower infectious densities would yield less efficient reductions in hidden infection importation per traveler screened. Moreover, focusing on Mississippi complements other potential policies by mitigating a less obvious but higher-risk source rather than competing for control of more commonly targeted states like Arizona or New Mexico. This strategic choice optimizes resource allocation and maximizes public health benefits by minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas over the next 14 days."

2025-12-24 19:29:28,642 - od_agent - INFO - Region virginia policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the potential origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, indicating a significant hidden infection risk. With E=9374 and I=4437 in a population of approximately 9,111,655 (sum of S, E, I, Q, R, D), the infectious density is about 0.00153, which is substantially higher than Arizona (~0.00012), New Mexico (~0.00025), and Texas (~0.00013). The daily inbound flow from Mississippi into Virginia is 3307, which while lower than Texas (17393) and Arizona (3797), still represents a meaningful vector for disease importation. Implementing targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi can capture and convert 90percent of exposed and infected individuals arriving, thus substantially reducing hidden infections entering Virginia. This targeted approach prioritizes a high-risk but less obvious source compared to the larger inflows from Texas and Arizona, addressing a critical gap in regional defense since other agents may focus on more prominent states like Texas. This policy balances risk reduction and operational feasibility by focusing on maximal infection capture rather than sheer travel volume, thereby optimizing the impact on minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two weeks.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the four origin states with inbound flow to Arizona, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population = (14243+6772)/6282009 ¡Ö 0.00327, which is notably higher than New Mexico (~0.00024), Texas (~0.00016), and Virginia (~0.0012). Despite a moderate daily inbound flow of 1899 travelers, the elevated infectious density indicates a disproportionately high risk of importing hidden infections. Implementing targeted inbound screening from Mississippi will intercept approximately 90percent of the exposed and infected travelers, significantly reducing the influx of undetected infectious individuals into Arizona. This action prioritizes managing a high-risk but moderate flow source, complementing other agents likely focusing on larger volume states like Texas or New Mexico, thus filling a critical regional surveillance gap and enhancing systemic defense. Screening Mississippi travelers leverages effective resource allocation to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona over the next two weeks, as controlling this high-risk origin will curb importation of infections that could seed new transmission chains locally.'

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for the origin states: Arizona has (7489+478)/~79.8M ¡Ö 0.0001, New Mexico (803+174)/~4.1M ¡Ö 0.00024, Texas (1605+2511)/~26.5M ¡Ö 0.00015, and Virginia (8215+1919)/~8.6M ¡Ö 0.0012. Virginia clearly has the highest infectious density by an order of magnitude, indicating a higher risk of importing exposed or infected travelers. Considering the average daily inbound flows into Mississippi, Virginia contributes 4364 travelers daily, which is moderate compared to Texas's 47996 but still significant given its higher infectious density. Implementing targeted inbound screening on Virginia allows us to intercept 90percent of the hidden infections among these 4364 travelers daily, effectively moving exposed and infected individuals into confirmed quarantine status (Q), thus substantially reducing the hidden infectious population entering Mississippi. This policy fills a critical gap in regional defense by focusing on a high-risk but less obvious source compared to Texas, which has a larger flow but lower infectious density. Arizona and New Mexico have lower infectious densities and smaller inflows, making screening less impactful. Therefore, targeting Virginia optimally balances risk and resource allocation to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density calculated as (E + I) / Population, indicating a significantly elevated risk of importing hidden infections into New Mexico. Specifically, Mississippi's exposed and infected populations sum to 20915, with a population of approximately 9,498 + 3669 + 2569693, but focusing on E and I (14243 + 6772) relative to its population of approximately 2,569,693, yielding the highest infectious density. Additionally, although Mississippi's inbound flow to New Mexico is low (1324 daily), the absolute number of hidden infections entering without screening could still be impactful due to the high prevalence. Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy at the Mississippi-New Mexico border could capture 90percent of these hidden infections, effectively converting many exposed and infected travelers into confirmed cases upon arrival, thus reducing undetected disease transmission locally. While states like Texas and Arizona have higher absolute inbound flows, their infectious densities are markedly lower, meaning the relative risk per traveler is less. Virginia's infectious density and flow are also lower than Mississippi's risk-adjusted profile. Selecting Mississippi as the targeted state fills a regional defense gap by addressing a high-risk but less obvious source, complementing broader regional efforts and mitigating systemic importation risks. Therefore, targeting Mississippi's inbound travelers maximizes detection utility and contributes efficiently to minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Assessing the infectious risk from origin states entering Texas over the next 14 days, Mississippi stands out due to a notably high infectious density. Calculating infectious density as (E + I) / Population, Mississippi's infectious individuals total 21,015 out of approximately 25,969,3 susceptible individuals, yielding an infectious density around 0.0081, significantly higher than Arizona (~0.0007), New Mexico (~0.00024), and Virginia (~0.0012). Furthermore, Mississippi's average daily inbound flow into Texas is 37,780, substantial enough to pose a meaningful importation risk. Implementing a targeted screening policy on travelers from Mississippi would intercept approximately 90percent of exposed and infected individuals arriving from this origin, effectively converting a large portion of hidden infections into confirmed cases, reducing silent community spread. This choice strategically addresses a high-risk secondary source rather than the more obvious Arizona, which, despite its large population and flow, has a lower infectious density and thus lower per capita importation risk. By focusing on Mississippi, Texas fills a regional defense gap and reduces systemic risks from a less obvious but significant infection source, optimizing intervention impact and minimizing expected cumulative cases and deaths over the 14-day horizon."

2025-12-24 19:29:54,010 - od_agent - INFO - Region virginia policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi has the highest infectious density calculated as (E+I)/Population, which is approximately (14243+6772)/2569693 ¡Ö 0.0081 or 0.81percent. This is significantly higher than Arizona (~0.0009), New Mexico (~0.00024), and Texas (~0.00015). Although Texas has the largest daily inflow into Virginia (21124), its infectious density is much lower, making its overall risk per traveler smaller. Mississippi's moderate inflow of 4177 combined with its high infection prevalence makes it the most critical source for targeted inbound screening. Implementing a 90percent screening on travelers from Mississippi will convert a large portion of exposed and infected individuals into confirmed (Q) status on arrival, effectively reducing hidden infections entering Virginia and lowering community spread risk. This targeted approach prioritizes a significant high-risk source that might be overlooked if focusing solely on travel volume. It also complements potential measures by other states targeting large hubs like Texas or Arizona, filling a gap in regional defense by addressing a smaller but more infectious source. Thus, focusing on Mississippi balances detection utility and systemic risk minimization, aiming to reduce cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population approximately 0.0124 (E=20624, I=9818, Population ~ 2390065), which is significantly greater than New Mexico (~0.00025), Texas (~0.00018), and Virginia (~0.00157). Although New Mexico and Texas contribute higher inbound flows to Arizona, their infectious densities are much lower, resulting in fewer hidden infections entering despite volume. Mississippi's inbound flow to Arizona is moderate at 2382 daily, but given its very high infection prevalence, it represents a disproportionately high risk of importing exposed and infected individuals. Implementing targeted inbound screening on Mississippi travelers will convert about 90percent of these hidden infections to confirmed cases upon arrival, thereby substantially reducing the risk of silent spread within Arizona. This approach prioritizes addressing the highest risk origin rather than the highest volume, effectively filling a critical gap in regional defense. Other states with larger flows but lower infectious densities pose less immediate threat per traveler and may be addressed by baseline protocols. Thus, focusing on Mississippi balances detection utility and resource deployment to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Arizona over the next two weeks."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the available origin states, Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population approximately 0.00158, calculated as (10321+2409)/8649862. This is substantially higher than Arizona (~0.0008), New Mexico (~0.00025), and Texas (~0.00018). Although Texas has the largest inbound flow to Mississippi (~52561 daily), its infectious density is quite low, limiting the overall hidden infection importation risk. Virginia, despite a more moderate daily inflow (~4702), presents a concentrated risk of importing exposed and infected individuals. By implementing targeted inbound screening on Virginia travelers, we can rigorously identify and quarantine 90percent of these hidden infections at the border, sharply reducing the importation of undetected infectious individuals. This focused intervention fills a critical gap since other states with high flow have relatively low infection prevalence, and this avoids overlapping efforts on more obvious high-flow but lower-risk states like Texas. Targeting Virginia thus balances detection utility and resource allocation, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi by preemptively interrupting a significant hidden transmission channel during the next 14-day horizon.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals that Mississippi has the highest concentration of hidden infections relative to its population, with (20624+9818)/2390065 ¡Ö 0.01215, significantly higher than Arizona (~0.0013), Texas (~0.00018), and Virginia (~0.0016). Despite Mississippi's lower absolute inbound flow into New Mexico (1425 daily), its disproportionately high infectious density means even a small number of travelers could import a high risk of concealed infections. Implementing targeted inbound screening for Mississippi travelers would effectively capture 90percent of these hidden infections (E and I), converting them to confirmed cases (Q) upon arrival and greatly reducing the risk of undetected community spread from this source. While Texas and Arizona contribute larger absolute inbound flows, their lower infectious densities reduce marginal risk per traveler. Targeting Mississippi complements broader regional defense by addressing a high-risk but lower-volume source that might be overlooked by other states focusing on high-volume origins. This strategic choice balances detection utility and systemic risk mitigation, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks."

Implementing targeted screening at this origin state's inbound flow can capture approximately 90percent of hidden infections (E+I) entering Texas, effectively reducing the importation of infectious individuals. Given Mississippi's high infectious density and non-negligible travel volume, the detection utility of screening is maximized here. Arizona and Virginia, while having higher absolute inflow numbers, have much lower infectious densities, reducing the overall impact of screening there. New Mexico has both low infectious density and moderate inflow, making it less critical for targeted screening. Selecting Mississippi as the restricted state fills a regional defense gap by focusing on a high-risk but less obvious source, rather than competing for intercepting travelers from more commonly targeted states like Arizona or Virginia. This targeted approach balances disease control effectiveness and resource allocation, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas over the 14-day horizon."

2025-12-24 19:30:20,642 - od_agent - INFO - Region virginia policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states considered for inbound screening, Mississippi presents the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population approximately 3.5percent (E=20624, I=9818 vs population ~ 2390065), which is significantly higher than Arizona (~0.08percent), New Mexico (~0.02percent), and Texas (~0.018percent). Despite Mississippi's relatively lower inbound flow into Virginia (4198 daily) compared to states like Arizona (5493) and Texas (25244), its very high infection prevalence suggests that even modest travel volumes carry a substantial risk of importing hidden infections. Implementing a 90percent effective screening policy targeting Mississippi arrivals would convert a large portion of exposed and infected travelers into confirmed cases (Q), effectively reducing the hidden infectious seeding into Virginia. This targeted intervention fills a crucial gap in regional defense by focusing on a secondary, less obvious but high-risk source rather than just the largest-volume states like Texas or Arizona where infection prevalence is lower. Although Texas has the highest inbound flow, its infectious density is much lower, making screening less impactful. Arizona¡¯s infectious density is intermediate but still much lower than Mississippi¡¯s. New Mexico has both low inbound flow and low infectious density, thus minimal impact if targeted. Therefore, prioritizing Mississippi for inbound screening balances detection utility and risk reduction, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia over the next 14 days."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals that Mississippi has the highest risk profile. Specifically, Mississippi's infectious density is approximately (27822+13271)/6521022 ¡Ö 0.0063, which is more than double that of Virginia (~0.0019), and significantly higher than Texas (~0.0002) and New Mexico (~0.00025). Coupled with a moderate daily inbound flow to Arizona (~2601), Mississippi represents a disproportionately high risk of importing hidden infections. By implementing a targeted inbound screening from Mississippi, we can rigorously detect and quarantine roughly 90percent of exposed and infected travelers, effectively reducing the hidden infectious influx. This targeted approach fills a critical defense gap against a secondary but high-risk source rather than focusing solely on the largest flow states like Texas or New Mexico, which have lower infectious densities. Texas and New Mexico have much larger flows but much lower infectious densities, so the marginal benefit of screening them is less impactful. Virginia, while having a slightly higher infectious density than Texas and New Mexico, has a much smaller inflow (~5763) and thus lower importation risk. Selecting Mississippi balances both moderate inflow and high infectious density, maximizing detection utility. This policy complements other states' possible measures by addressing a high-risk state that might otherwise be under-monitored, thereby minimizing Arizona's cumulative cases and deaths more effectively over the 14-day horizon."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals that Virginia has a notably higher infectious density compared to Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Virginia's exposed and infected combined (E=12963, I=3026) over its population indicates a significant risk of importing hidden infections into Mississippi. Despite Texas having a much larger inbound flow to Mississippi (60331 daily), its infectious density is lower due to its large population and relatively fewer exposed individuals relative to size. Arizona has a very high inflow (2443) but a very low infectious density because its infected count is low relative to its population. New Mexico has a low inflow and low infectious density, making it less risky overall. By selecting Virginia for targeted inbound screening, we maximize the detection and conversion of hidden infections (E and I) into confirmed cases (Q), effectively removing a large fraction of potential new infectious individuals from entering community transmission unchecked. This targeted approach balances the substantial infectious risk from Virginia's travelers with a moderate inbound flow, thus optimizing resource use for screening. Choosing Virginia also complements other agents potentially focusing on high-volume states like Texas, filling a regional gap and enhancing overall epidemic control synergy. Implementing a 90percent rigorous screening policy for Virginia-origin travelers over the next 14 days is the strategic choice to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population approximately 0.019 (27822+13271)/2119139, which is significantly greater than Arizona (~0.0015), Texas (~0.0002), and Virginia (~0.0020). Despite having a relatively low average daily inbound flow to New Mexico (1605), targeting Mississippi for inbound screening yields a high detection utility because the proportion of exposed and infected travelers is likely higher. Implementing a 90percent screening conversion on arrivals from Mississippi will effectively intercept a substantial fraction of hidden infections, reducing the risk of seeding new local transmissions in New Mexico. While Texas has the highest inbound flow (132,778), its infectious density is much lower, making screening less efficient per traveler screened. Arizona and Virginia show moderate infectious densities but also larger travel volumes, yet their risk per traveler is lower than Mississippi¡¯s. Choosing Mississippi is thus a strategic decision to fill a regional defense gap by targeting a high-risk but smaller inflow source, complementing potential broader policies by other states and avoiding duplication of effort focused on large but lower-risk states. This targeted approach balances resource allocation and risk mitigation to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, with approximately 41,093 infected/exposed out of 4,090,737 total (S+E+I+Q+R+D), yielding a significantly higher risk compared to Arizona, New Mexico, and Virginia. Despite a moderate inbound flow from Mississippi to Texas (37,844 daily), the absolute numbers of hidden infectious individuals (E and I) entering Texas from Mississippi are substantial and pose a critical risk for introducing new infections. Implementing a 90percent rigorous screening on inbound travelers from Mississippi would effectively detect and convert the majority of these hidden cases into confirmed (Q) status, thereby significantly reducing the silent spread upon entry. Arizona and Virginia have larger populations but lower infectious densities, and New Mexico, although having a high inbound flow, has much lower infectious density and hidden infections. Targeting Mississippi fills a strategic gap in regional defense by addressing a high-risk but somewhat less obvious source compared to larger states like Arizona or Virginia, mitigating systemic risks without overlapping heavily with other agents' likely choices. Therefore, selecting Mississippi for targeted inbound screening balances the trade-off between risk and coverage, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the origin states considered, Mississippi presents the highest infectious density with (E+I)=41103 over a population roughly summed from S through D (~2119139 + 27822 + 13271 + 7719 + 23329 + 937), yielding an infectious density approximately 1.9percent, which is significantly higher than Arizona (~0.0015), New Mexico (~0.025percent), and Texas (~0.02percent). Although Texas has a very large inbound flow into Virginia (26942 daily) compared to Mississippi (4459), the extremely high hidden infectious load (E+I) in Mississippi combined with a moderate inbound flow results in a substantial number of potential hidden infections entering Virginia daily. Implementing targeted screening at the Mississippi-Virginia border can capture 90percent of these hidden infections upon arrival, substantially reducing the importation of exposed and infected individuals and mitigating subsequent local transmission. While screening Texas might affect a larger volume of travelers, the relative infectious density is lower, reducing the marginal benefit of screening there. Arizona and New Mexico have lower infectious densities and/or inbound flows, making them less critical targets. Choosing Mississippi addresses a critical regional vulnerability, potentially overlooked by broader policies focused on larger states like Texas, thereby improving coordination in regional epidemic control and filling a gap in defense rather than competing redundantly with other agents screening higher-volume states. This targeted approach aligns with the objective to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two weeks.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The decision to implement targeted inbound screening from Mississippi is driven by its notably high infectious density and substantial inbound flow into Arizona. Calculating infectious density as (E+I)/Population, Mississippi shows a very high rate: (33651+16077)/~7,483,667 ¡Ö 0.0066, which is considerably higher than New Mexico (~0.00028), Texas (~0.00022), and Virginia (~0.0024). Moreover, the daily average inbound flow from Mississippi to Arizona is 2,337, which, while lower than Texas or New Mexico, represents a significant channel for importation of hidden infections. By applying a 90percent screening policy at this border, we can capture and convert a large portion of exposed and infected travelers into confirmed cases (Q), thus preventing them from contributing to hidden transmission chains in Arizona. Targeting Mississippi addresses a critical gap since other states with high flows (Texas and New Mexico) have much lower infectious densities, meaning screening there yields less marginal benefit. Virginia has a moderate infectious density but much lower flow into Arizona, offering less impact. This selective approach balances coordination by focusing on the most apparent high-risk and under-monitored source, thereby minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Arizona over the next two weeks while avoiding diffuse efforts that might dilute resources.'

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population = (16273+3799)/8642949 ¡Ö 0.00235, which is notably higher than Arizona (0.002), New Mexico (0.00028), and Texas (0.00022). Although Texas has the largest inbound flow to Mississippi (63448 daily), its infectious density is the lowest, reducing the relative risk per traveler. Virginia's inbound flow to Mississippi is moderate at 6108 daily, but combined with its elevated infectious density, it results in a significant number of potential hidden infections entering Mississippi. By implementing targeted inbound screening for Virginia travelers, approximately 90percent of exposed and infected individuals entering Mississippi from this source can be identified and quarantined, thereby substantially reducing the importation of hidden infectious cases. This targeted approach balances risk reduction with resource allocation by focusing on a high-risk but moderately sized flow, rather than attempting to address the largest flow with low infectious risk or spreading resources thinly. While other agents might prioritize Texas due to volume, targeting Virginia fills a critical gap in regional defense by mitigating a concentrated infectious source. Therefore, selecting Virginia for inbound screening optimally minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Mississippi presents the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population approximately equal to (33651+16077)/1740120 = 0.028 or 2.8percent, which is significantly higher than Arizona (~0.002), Texas (~0.0002), and Virginia (~0.0024). Despite having a relatively low inbound flow into New Mexico (1565 daily), the high infectious density means that even a small number of travelers could import a disproportionately large number of hidden infections. Implementing the targeted inbound screening policy on Mississippi travelers would identify and quarantine approximately 90percent of the exposed and infected individuals arriving from there, effectively reducing the influx of hidden infectious cases. While Texas has the highest inflow (132369 daily), its infectious density is very low, so the expected hidden infections imported per day are smaller compared to Mississippi's risk. Arizona and Virginia have moderate infectious densities but much higher inflows; however, Mississippi's extremely high infectious density makes it the most critical source to address. Targeting Mississippi fills a gap in regional defense by focusing on a smaller but highly infectious source rather than competing for resources on the obvious high-volume states (Arizona or Texas). This targeted approach optimizes risk reduction per screening resource and minimizes cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico over the 14-day horizon."

Although Arizona and Virginia have considerable populations, their infectious densities are lower. In terms of inbound flow into Texas, New Mexico has the highest daily inflow (149,098), followed by Arizona (54,141), Mississippi (36,298), and Virginia (29,795). Mississippi, despite a moderate inflow, poses a higher risk due to its dense infectious population. Implementing targeted inbound screening for Mississippi travelers would capture a substantial number of exposed and infected individuals, given the rigorous 90percent detection of E and I upon arrival, significantly reducing hidden importations. Targeting Mississippi addresses an often overlooked but critical source, complementing other potential policies by neighboring states, thus improving regional defense coordination rather than competing over the obvious high-volume states like New Mexico or Arizona. This focused approach balances risk reduction and resource allocation effectively for Texas, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths over the coming two weeks.'

This high infectious density indicates a significant hidden infectious population potentially entering Virginia. Considering the average daily inbound flow from Mississippi to Virginia is 4848 travelers, applying a 90percent rigorous screening would identify and quarantine approximately 90percent of the exposed and infected individuals in this flow, effectively reducing the importation of hidden infections and consequently lowering secondary transmissions in Virginia. While Texas contributes a larger volume of travelers (28822 daily), its infectious density is much lower, diminishing the relative risk per traveler. Targeting Mississippi addresses a critical gap in regional defense by focusing on a smaller but higher-risk source, complementing other agents that may focus on larger but lower-risk states. This strategy optimally balances detection benefits against operational feasibility, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two weeks.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population approximately 55,112 / 6,249,187 ¡Ö 0.00882, significantly above the others: Virginia at ~0.00315, New Mexico ~0.00032, and Texas ~0.00024. Although Mississippi's inbound flow to Arizona is the lowest (2,348 daily), its very high infectious density means a disproportionately large number of exposed and infected individuals could be arriving unchecked. Targeting Mississippi for the targeted inbound screening policy leverages a high detection utility: capturing 90percent of these hidden infections upon arrival will substantially reduce seeding of new cases in Arizona. While Texas and New Mexico provide far higher daily flows, their lower infectious densities dilute their relative risk per traveler. Virginia's moderate infectious density and flow are less critical compared to Mississippi. This choice prioritizes addressing a high-risk but less obvious source, complementing likely broader regional defenses focusing on larger population flows. This targeted approach maximizes impact by intercepting a concentrated infectious population, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona over the next two weeks. No other state combines such a high infectious density with non-negligible flow, making Mississippi the optimal candidate for the inbound screening intervention."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Virginia and Arizona have notably high numbers of exposed (E) and infected (I) individuals, but Virginia's infectious density ((E+I)/Population) is significantly higher: approximately 2.99e-3 compared to Arizona's 2.41e-3, New Mexico's 3.22e-4, and Texas's 2.32e-4. Although Texas has the largest inbound flow into Mississippi (57006 daily), its infectious density is the lowest, implying a lower risk per traveler. Virginia's inbound flow is moderate at 5270 daily, but given its higher infectious density, the number of hidden infections entering Mississippi daily is substantial (E+I ~ 25116, so about 2.99e-3 times 5270 ¡Ö 15.8 hidden infections daily). Implementing a 90percent screening policy for Virginia arrivals would intercept approximately 14 hidden infections daily, significantly reducing silent introduction of cases. Arizona has a comparable infectious density but much lower inbound flow (2415), leading to fewer hidden infections captured. Targeting Virginia balances risk reduction and resource allocation effectively. While Arizona is also high-risk, its lower inbound flow and marginally lower infectious density make Virginia the more impactful choice. New Mexico and Texas, despite larger populations and flows, have much lower infectious densities, making screening less efficient there. This focused intervention on Virginia complements broader regional controls, filling a critical gap in defense against importation, reducing cumulative cases and deaths in Mississippi over the 14-day horizon."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population approximately 0.0393 (55,112 infectious out of 1,750,357 total), far exceeding Arizona (~0.0024), Texas (~0.00023), and Virginia (~0.0032). Despite its relatively low average daily inbound flow to New Mexico (1,638), the high prevalence of hidden infections (E and I) means that even a small number of arrivals can significantly contribute to disease spread. Implementing targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi will enable identification and quarantine of 90percent of exposed and infected individuals, substantially reducing importation of hidden infections. The detection utility is high for Mississippi due to this combination of high infectious density and manageable flow volume, making screening feasible and impactful. While Arizona and Texas have much larger daily inflows to New Mexico, their infectious densities are considerably lower, reducing the relative benefit of screening their inbound travelers. Virginia has moderate density but also low flow. By focusing on Mississippi, New Mexico fills a critical gap in regional defense, addressing a high-risk secondary source that might be overlooked by other states prioritizing larger origins. This targeted approach balances risk reduction with operational feasibility and complements broader regional epidemic control efforts, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths effectively over the next two weeks.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state, Mississippi stands out with a notably high infectious density: (37235+17877)/~127,000,000 is significant compared to others. Although the total population is not directly given, the sum of compartments suggests Mississippi has a concentrated infectious population. The inbound flow from Mississippi to Texas is 33,936 daily, which is substantial but less than New Mexico and Arizona. Screening travelers from Mississippi can capture a large number of hidden infections because a rigorous 90percent screening would convert most exposed and infected travelers into confirmed cases, thereby reducing silent introductions. Arizona has a large population and high inbound flow, but its infectious density ((19815+1264)/~1.4M) is much lower than Mississippi's. New Mexico has a high flow to Texas (142,786) but very low infectious density ((1438+309)/~5.3M), making screening less impactful there. Virginia has moderate infectious density but lower flow to Texas. Targeting Mississippi fills a critical gap in regional defense by addressing a highly infectious source with moderate flow, which could otherwise seed new cases in Texas. This intervention balances high detection utility and effective risk mitigation, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas over the next two weeks."

Considering daily inbound flows from Mississippi to Virginia at 4413, screening here would convert roughly 90percent of these hidden infections (E and I) into confirmed cases (Q), significantly reducing silent disease importation. Arizona and Texas, though having larger absolute flows, have much lower infectious densities, and New Mexico's flow and infectious density are both low. Targeting Mississippi fills a critical gap in regional defense by focusing on a high-risk but less voluminous source, where screening can yield high detection utility. This choice balances resource allocation and systemic risk reduction better than targeting the obvious high-flow states with low infectious densities. Therefore, implementing targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi for the next 14 days is optimal to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi presents the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population = (38539+18684)/~6,383,668 ¡Ö 0.0091, which is substantially higher than New Mexico (~0.00036), Texas (~0.00026), and Virginia (~0.0037). Mississippi's daily inbound flow into Arizona is 1,984, which is relatively low compared to Texas (44,848) and New Mexico (24,321) but still significant. By targeting Mississippi, the screening policy will capture and convert approximately 90percent of the exposed and infected individuals in this inbound flow, significantly reducing hidden infections entering Arizona. For instance, estimated incoming exposed and infected travelers from Mississippi are roughly (38539+18684)/6,383,668 * 1984 ¡Ö 18.5 individuals daily, and screening would detect about 16-17 of these. This targeted approach addresses a high-risk source with moderate travel volume, effectively reducing importation without overly restricting high-volume but lower-risk flows. While Texas has higher inbound volume, its infectious density is much lower, so the impact of screening is less pronounced there. New Mexico¡¯s infectious density is minimal despite high inflows, making screening less beneficial. Virginia holds moderate risk but lower flow than Texas and New Mexico, and its infectious density is less than half Mississippi¡¯s. Choosing Mississippi also complements regional control efforts by focusing on a high-risk but less obvious source state, filling a gap in the defense layer. This targeted inbound screening for 14 days on Mississippi travelers is the optimal balance to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona."

 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Arizona presents the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population = (25008+1592)/900,8927 ¡Ö 0.0293, indicating a significant hidden infectious population. This is notably higher than Virginia's 0.0037, New Mexico's 0.00037, and Texas's 0.00026, which are substantially lower risk profiles. Arizona also has a non-negligible average daily inbound flow into Mississippi (2079), meaning that without intervention, a considerable number of exposed and infected individuals may enter. Implementing a targeted inbound screening on Arizona would detect and convert 90percent of these hidden infections (E+I) among incoming travelers into confirmed cases (Q), effectively reducing the silent seeding of infections within Mississippi. While Texas has a much larger inbound flow (51070), its infectious density is very low, so targeting Texas would have less impact per traveler screened. Choosing Arizona prioritizes addressing the highest source risk rather than competing to screen the large but lower-risk Texas flow, filling a critical gap in regional defense. This focused approach maximizes the detection utility by capturing a disproportionate number of hidden infections relative to the flow volume. Consequently, the screening on inbound travelers from Arizona is expected to substantially slow the importation-driven epidemic growth in Mississippi over the next two weeks."

Although Mississippi's inbound flow into New Mexico is relatively low at 1219 daily travelers, the concentration of hidden infections (E and I) among these travelers is disproportionately high, indicating a substantial risk of importing undetected infectious individuals. Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy for Mississippi travelers will convert 90percent of these hidden infections into confirmed cases upon arrival, substantially reducing the silent seeding of infections within New Mexico. This approach prioritizes a secondary source of risk rather than the obvious high-volume but lower infectious density states like Texas, thus complementing regional defense strategies by mitigating a critical gap in inbound infection control. Screening travelers from Mississippi balances detection utility with focused intervention, optimizing reduction in cumulative confirmed cases and deaths over the next two weeks while managing resource allocation effectively. Therefore, restricting inbound travelers from Mississippi with rigorous screening is the recommended policy to minimize epidemic impact in New Mexico."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Evaluating the infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, mississippi shows an exceptionally high risk with (38539+18684)/1092500 ¡Ö 0.052 or 5.2percent, which is significantly higher than other origin states: arizona at ~0.0031, new mexico at ~0.00037, and virginia at ~0.0041. This indicates mississippi harbors a much larger proportion of hidden infections. Considering the inbound flows into Texas, mississippi contributes a moderate daily average of 31,542 travelers, which is substantial enough to warrant targeted screening but not the largest volume. By imposing a rigorous 90percent screening on inbound travelers from mississippi, a significant number of hidden infectious individuals (E and I) can be detected and moved to confirmed quarantine status, effectively reducing the risk of undetected community spread from this high-prevalence source. Although arizona and virginia have larger inbound flows, their infectious densities are markedly lower, so screening them would yield fewer detections per traveler. Choosing mississippi targets a critical vulnerability in regional defense by addressing a secondary but highly infectious source, complementing the likely attention other states may place on bigger states like arizona. This strategic focus balances detection utility and systemic risk mitigation, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas over the next two weeks.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Assessing the infectious density, Mississippi exhibits a notably high proportion of infectious individuals relative to its population: (E+I)/Population = (38539+18684)/1092500 ¡Ö 0.052 or 5.2percent, which is substantially higher than Arizona (~0.0035), New Mexico (~0.00036), and Texas (~0.00025). Despite Mississippi's lower daily inbound flow into Virginia (3879) compared to Texas (27574) and Arizona (5239), its very high infectious density means each inbound traveler has a higher risk of being in the Exposed or Infected compartments. Implementing rigorous 90percent screening on travelers from Mississippi will capture a significant fraction of these hidden infections (E and I), effectively converting them to Confirmed (Q) and reducing the infectious seeding into Virginia. Targeting Mississippi is a strategic choice to fill a gap in regional defense by focusing on a high-risk but less obvious origin, as other agents may target larger states like Texas with higher volume but lower infectious density. This targeted inbound screening is expected to minimize new confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia by reducing the hidden infectious population influx from a disproportionately risky origin state."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density among the origin states, with (E+I)/Population approximately 0.063 (52707/839877), far exceeding new mexico (~0.00043), texas (~0.00028), and virginia (~0.0046). Despite its smaller population, the intense concentration of exposed and infected individuals makes it a critical source of risk for Arizona. The average daily inbound flow from Mississippi into Arizona is 1831 travelers, which, while smaller than flows from Texas and New Mexico, still represents a significant channel for disease importation. Implementing targeted inbound screening for travelers from Mississippi will identify and quarantine approximately 90percent of exposed and infected individuals arriving from this source, effectively removing a substantial hidden infectious population before community integration. This targeted approach balances high detection utility with manageable resource allocation, as screening all travelers from higher flow states with lower infectious density would be less efficient. Choosing Mississippi as the restricted state addresses an obvious high-risk source that may be overlooked by other states focusing on larger but lower prevalence origin states. This focused intervention complements broader regional efforts by filling a crucial gap in containment strategy, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona over the next two weeks.'

2025-12-24 19:32:33,199 - od_agent - INFO - Region mississippi policy response:
 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population approximately 0.0047 (34872 infectious out of roughly 11,872,885 total), surpassing Arizona (~0.0036), New Mexico (~0.0004), and Texas (~0.0003). Additionally, Virginia contributes a moderate daily inbound flow to Mississippi (~5593), which while lower than Texas, still represents a significant channel for disease importation. By implementing a targeted screening policy for travelers from Virginia, we can rigorously identify and convert 90percent of exposed and infected individuals into confirmed quarantine status upon arrival, drastically reducing the hidden infectious population entering Mississippi from this high-risk source. This targeted intervention focuses on a secondary but highly infectious origin rather than the obvious largest flow source Texas, which has a lower infectious density but much higher volume; targeting Virginia complements broader regional defense efforts by filling a gap that might be overlooked if only volume-based restrictions were considered. This balanced approach minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by prioritizing effective screening where the infection risk per traveler is highest, while avoiding the systemic disruption of restricting flows from the largest traffic source. Overall, this policy strategically mitigates importation risk from a critical infectious hotspot, enhancing Mississippi's epidemic control over the next 14 days."

2025-12-24 19:32:38,759 - od_agent - INFO - Region new mexico policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, with (35373+17334)/839877 ¡Ö 0.063 or 6.3percent, significantly higher than Arizona (~0.0037), Texas (~0.00028), and Virginia (~0.0047). This indicates a much larger proportion of hidden infections in Mississippi's population. Despite having a relatively low average daily inbound flow into New Mexico (1134), the high infectious density makes even this smaller flow a critical risk vector. Implementing targeted inbound screening on Mississippi travelers will identify and quarantine approximately 90percent of its exposed and infected individuals entering New Mexico, substantially reducing the hidden infectious importation. Arizona and Texas have much larger inflows but substantially lower infectious densities; Virginia's infectious density is higher than Arizona and Texas but still far below Mississippi's. Targeting Mississippi leverages a gap that might be overlooked by other agents focusing on larger states like Arizona or Texas. This strategy maximizes detection utility by focusing on a high-risk, under-monitored source, effectively complementing regional defense and minimizing New Mexico's cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. Therefore, restricting inbound travelers from Mississippi with a rigorous screening policy for the next 14 days is the optimal intervention."

2025-12-24 19:32:43,141 - od_agent - INFO - Region texas policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Mississippi presents the highest infectious density calculated as (E+I)/Population. With E=35373 and I=17334, the total hidden infections amount to 52707 in a population of approximately 839877, yielding an infectious density of roughly 6.28percent, which is substantially higher than Arizona (~0.38percent), New Mexico (~0.04percent), and Virginia (~0.46percent). Although New Mexico has the highest inbound flow into Texas (145,606 daily), its infectious density is very low. Mississippi's inbound flow to Texas is moderate at 29,893 daily, meaning enhanced screening there can effectively reduce a significant number of hidden infections entering Texas. Implementing the 90percent screening and detection on travelers from Mississippi would convert the majority of exposed and infected individuals into confirmed cases upon arrival, substantially reducing the risk of undetected importations. This targeted policy complements broader regional defense by not focusing solely on the largest inflow states or the most obvious high-volume routes like New Mexico or Arizona, but rather filling a critical gap where infectious density is alarmingly high. This ensures a more balanced, risk-based border control strategy that minimizes confirmed cases and deaths in Texas over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi presents the highest infectious density, with (E+I)/Population approximately 52,707/839,877 (~6.28percent), significantly above other states: Arizona (~0.39percent), New Mexico (~0.04percent), and Texas (~0.03percent). This high infectious density indicates a substantial risk of importing hidden infections into Virginia. Although Mississippi's average daily inbound flow into Virginia is relatively low (3,963 travelers) compared to larger states like Texas (28,749) and Arizona (5,591), the high prevalence of exposed and infected individuals among these travelers makes targeted screening highly valuable. Implementing the 90percent screening mandate on Mississippi arrivals would convert the majority of these hidden infections into confirmed cases upon arrival, markedly reducing the risk of undetected spread within Virginia. Targeting Mississippi rather than the larger but lower prevalence states fills a critical regional defense gap by addressing a concentrated source of infection that might be overlooked if focusing only on volume. This approach balances risk reduction and resource allocation efficiently, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia over the 14-day horizon. Hence, selecting Mississippi for inbound screening is the optimal policy choice."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Mississippi presents the highest infectious density among origin states entering Arizona, with (E+I) = 29010 + 14332 = 43342 out of a population of 6,432,706, yielding an infectious density of approximately 0.00674 (0.674percent). This is significantly greater than Virginia's 0.0056, New Mexico's 0.00047, and Texas's 0.00032, indicating Mississippi as the highest risk source for importing exposed and infected individuals. The inbound flow from Mississippi to Arizona is moderate at 1,898 per day, so implementing targeted screening here will effectively capture a large number of hidden infections¡ªestimated as 90percent of the exposed and infected travelers. Specifically, among 1,898 daily arrivals, roughly 43342 / 6,432,706 ¡Ö 0.00674 proportion are infectious, so about 13 infectious arrivals daily without screening. With 90percent detection, approximately 12 of these would be intercepted and moved directly to confirmed status, greatly reducing community exposure. Targeting Mississippi fills a regional defense gap because other states with higher inflows, like Texas and New Mexico, have much lower infectious densities, and Virginia, while moderately high, has lower inflow to Arizona. Hence, focusing on Mississippi optimizes detection utility per traveler screened and complements broader epidemic control by addressing a high-risk but less obvious source rather than competing with typical high-flow states that may receive attention from other regions. This targeted approach minimizes Arizona's cumulative confirmed cases and deaths over the next two weeks by reducing importation of hidden infections from the riskiest origin state."

2025-12-24 19:33:01,664 - od_agent - INFO - Region mississippi policy response:
 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Virginia represents the highest infectious density when considering the ratio of exposed and infected individuals to the total population: (E+I)/Population for Virginia is (38686+9051)/8449460 ¡Ö 0.0057, which is substantially higher than Arizona (~0.0048), New Mexico (~0.00046), and Texas (~0.0003). Although Texas has the largest daily inflow into Mississippi (42933), its infectious density is relatively low, making the risk per traveler lower. Virginia's inflow is moderate (4911), so targeting Virginia allows us to effectively intercept a meaningful number of hidden infections with a manageable volume of travelers. Applying 90percent screening to Virginia inbound travelers would convert approximately 90percent of the hidden infectious population (E+I) among these travelers into confirmed cases (Q), substantially reducing the risk of undetected infectious individuals entering Mississippi. This targeted approach prioritizes a high-risk source with moderate traffic, improving detection utility while avoiding the dilution effect of screening very large, low-risk flows like Texas. Given that Texas is commonly recognized as a high-volume source, other jurisdictions may already focus on it, so selecting Virginia helps fill a regional defense gap by addressing a significant but less obvious infection source. Therefore, the recommended policy is to implement targeted inbound screening on travelers arriving from Virginia for the next 14 days to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi presents the highest infectious density ratio, calculated as (E+I)/Population, indicating a significant hidden infectious population relative to its size. Specifically, with E=29010 and I=14332 over a population of approximately 1,028,409 (sum of given compartments), the infectious density far exceeds that of Arizona, Texas, and Virginia. Although Texas has a much larger inflow into New Mexico (103,286 daily) compared to Mississippi (1,317 daily), the infectious density and absolute hidden infections from Mississippi travelers pose a disproportionate risk. The screening policy's detection utility is maximized by targeting Mississippi, as 90percent of its inbound exposed and infected travelers can be identified and quarantined immediately, removing a critical source of new infections before community spread. While Arizona and Virginia have substantial inflows, their infectious densities are lower, and Texas, despite high inflow, has relatively lower infectious density and exposed cases. By focusing on Mississippi, this policy does not compete with likely measures targeting obvious high-volume sources like Texas or Arizona, thereby complementing broader regional defense and filling a strategic gap. This targeted screening will reduce cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks more effectively than a no-screening or high-volume-only approach."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest Infectious Density with (E+I)/Population approximately (29010+14332)/681226 ¡Ö 0.063, which is significantly higher than Arizona (~0.0047), Virginia (~0.0057), and New Mexico (~0.00047). Although Arizona and Virginia have larger populations and inbound flows, their relative infectious densities are much lower. Mississippi's inbound flow into Texas is 31,493 daily, which is moderately high and thus presents a substantial risk of importing hidden infections. Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy on travelers from Mississippi would enable rigorous 90percent detection and conversion of exposed and infected individuals into the confirmed compartment upon arrival, effectively reducing the hidden infectious influx. Estimating roughly, screening captures about 90percent of (E+I) fraction of 31,493 travelers, significantly lowering the risk of unseen spread within Texas. Selecting Mississippi aligns with a strategic focus on mitigating a critical regional infection hotspot rather than competing with other agents who may target more populous states with lower infection proportions. This targeted approach optimizes resource allocation and reduces cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas by addressing a high-risk vector that might otherwise be underemphasized. Therefore, screening inbound flows from Mississippi for the next 14 days is the most impactful policy to slow disease spread in Texas."

This is significantly elevated compared to other states: Arizona (~0.0047), New Mexico (~0.0004), and Texas (~0.00028). Although Mississippi's average daily inbound flow into Virginia is relatively low at 3517, the high infectious density means a disproportionate number of exposed and infected travelers could introduce new cases. Implementing a 90percent screening and conversion to confirmed status (Q) at the Virginia border for travelers from Mississippi would capture the majority of these hidden infections, substantially reducing the risk of undetected importation. Arizona, despite its large inbound flow, has a much lower infectious density, so targeting Mississippi addresses a critical gap in regional defense by focusing on a secondary but high-risk source. Texas and New Mexico have moderate flows but very low infectious densities, making screening less impactful. Thus, prioritizing Mississippi balances detection utility and systemic risk reduction by catching high-risk travelers that might otherwise evade detection, ultimately minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia over the next 14 days."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the potential origin states for inbound travelers to Arizona, Mississippi presents the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population approximately equal to (27590+12196)/6474992 ¡Ö 0.0061, which is significantly higher than New Mexico (~0.0005), Texas (~0.0003), and Virginia (~0.0071 but with much lower inflow). Although Virginia has a comparable infectious density (0.0071), its inbound flow to Arizona (5618) is considerably lower than Mississippi's 1731. Given the large number of exposed and infected individuals in Mississippi combined with a non-negligible daily inbound flow, targeted inbound screening at this state can effectively reduce hidden infections imported into Arizona. The 90percent screening mandate would convert a majority of these hidden cases (E and I) into confirmed cases (Q) upon arrival, thus preventing further undetected transmission chains in Arizona. While Texas has the highest inbound flow into Arizona (44065), its infectious density is low, making screening less impactful there. New Mexico has a high volume of travelers (28008) but very low infectious density, so the benefit of screening is minimal. Targeting Mississippi fills a gap in regional defense by focusing on a smaller but higher-risk source, rather than overlapping with others who might prioritize Texas or Virginia. This approach balances the risk of importation with resource allocation for screening and maximizes the reduction in potential hidden infectious entries, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Arizona over the next two weeks."

Despite having moderate inbound flow (3822 daily), Virginia's elevated infectious density poses a substantial risk of importing exposed and infected individuals. By selecting Virginia for targeted inbound screening, approximately 90percent of its inbound hidden infections (E and I) can be detected and converted to confirmed cases (Q), drastically reducing the risk of undetected seeding events in Mississippi. Arizona has a higher absolute number of hidden infections but shares a very large flow to Mississippi (1718 daily) and is likely targeted by other regional agents due to its size and connectivity, so focusing on Virginia complements regional defense by filling a gap rather than overlapping efforts. Texas has the largest inbound flow (39373) but very low infectious density, and New Mexico has both low flow and low infectious density, making them less critical. Hence, prioritizing Virginia balances risk reduction and efficient use of screening resources to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next 14 days."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi stands out with a notably high infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population = (27590+12196)/(610786+27590+12196+10006+110194+3291) approximately 0.056, which is significantly higher than Arizona (~0.006), Texas (~0.0003), and Virginia (~0.007). Despite having a much smaller inbound flow into New Mexico (1372 daily) compared to Texas (99060) and Arizona (30556), Mississippi's high infectious density means its inbound travelers carry a disproportionately higher risk of introducing new infections. By targeting Mississippi for a rigorous 90percent screening policy, we can effectively convert a large fraction of hidden exposed and infected individuals into confirmed cases upon arrival, significantly reducing the silent seeding of infections in New Mexico. Although Texas has a substantially higher inbound flow, its infectious density is very low, making screening there less cost-effective. Arizona and Virginia have moderate infectious densities but also higher inbound flows; however, Mississippi's extremely elevated infectious density and moderate inbound flow make it the critical gap in regional defense to address. This selection balances targeting a high-risk but under-monitored source rather than competing with other jurisdictions likely focusing on Texas or Arizona, thereby maximizing the marginal benefit of screening in protecting New Mexico's population and minimizing cumulative cases and deaths over the next 14 days."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the origin states, Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, where E+I=58016 out of approximately 8.79 million, yielding an infectious density significantly higher than Arizona, Mississippi, and New Mexico. Although Arizona has a large exposed population, its infectious density is diluted over a much larger population and its inbound flow to Texas is moderate. Mississippi shows a high number of exposed and infected individuals but has a smaller inbound flow compared to Virginia. New Mexico has the lowest infectious density and a moderate inbound flow. Given the high infectious density and substantial daily inbound flow from Virginia (23,716), implementing a targeted inbound screening with a 90percent detection rate on Virginia travelers will effectively reduce the hidden infectious cases entering Texas. This measure will convert a significant portion of incoming exposed and infected individuals into confirmed cases (Q), thereby enabling immediate isolation and reducing community transmission. Targeting Virginia fills a critical gap in regional defense, as other states with high infections either have lower flows or lower infectious densities. This choice balances risk reduction with operational feasibility, focusing resources on the highest-risk inbound population to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas over the next two weeks.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Mississippi presents the highest infectious density among the origin states, with (E+I)=39786 out of a total population approximately summing S+E+I+Q+R+D = 610786 + 27590 + 12196 + 10006 + 110194 + 3291 ¡Ö 773063, yielding an infectious density of about 5.15percent. This is significantly higher than Arizona (~0.60percent), New Mexico (~0.05percent), and Texas (~0.03percent). Furthermore, the average daily inbound flow from Mississippi into Virginia is 3518, which, while lower than Arizona and Texas, still represents a meaningful channel of potential disease importation. By targeting Mississippi for rigorous 90percent screening, we can detect and convert a large fraction of the incoming exposed and infected individuals into the confirmed compartment, substantially reducing the hidden infectious flow into Virginia. This focused screening on Mississippi covers a critical high-risk but less obvious source, complementing potential policies in other states that might prioritize Arizona or Texas with larger flows but much lower infectious densities. The strategy aims to fill a gap in regional defense by intercepting a disproportionately risky origin state rather than the biggest flow sources, thus optimally reducing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia during the two-week horizon.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits an extremely high infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population = (40762+14740)/6656709 ¡Ö 0.0083, which far exceeds the infectious densities of New Mexico (~0.00063), Texas (~0.00061), and Virginia (~0.0087 but with a much larger population diluting mobility impact). Despite Mississippi's relatively smaller overall population, its inbound flow into Arizona stands at 1989 daily travelers, a non-negligible number given its high hidden infection load. By enforcing a 90percent screening mandate on inbound travelers from Mississippi, we can identify and quarantine approximately 90percent of the exposed and infected individuals entering Arizona from this high-risk origin, effectively preventing a significant number of otherwise undetected imported cases from contributing to local transmission. Although Virginia's infectious density is somewhat comparable, its daily inbound flow to Arizona (5800) is higher; however, its infectious density is slightly less concentrated, and the coordination considerations suggest targeting Mississippi fills a critical gap in the regional defense as other states might focus on larger, more obvious sources like Texas or Virginia. Selecting Mississippi balances detection utility and systemic risk mitigation by focusing on a highly infectious yet less conspicuous source, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona over the next two weeks."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Virginia exhibits a notably high infectious density with (E+I) at 69,443 over a population sum of approximately 8,312,431, yielding an infectious density of roughly 0.00836. Arizona also has a significant infectious density of approximately 0.0073, but Virginia's is slightly higher. Texas and New Mexico have much lower infectious densities (Texas ~0.00062 and New Mexico ~0.00062). Additionally, Virginia's average daily inbound flow into Mississippi is 4112, which is higher than New Mexico's 1120 but lower than Texas's 39010. However, Texas's infectious density is much lower, reducing the marginal benefit of screening there. Screening travelers from Virginia would capture approximately 90percent of the hidden infections (E+I) among the 4112 daily arrivals, equating to roughly 62,498 individuals over 14 days (90percent of 69,443 infectious density proportion multiplied by 4112 daily arrivals and 14 days), significantly reducing imported hidden infectious cases. Targeting Virginia fills a critical gap in regional defense by focusing on a high-risk source with substantial mobility into Mississippi, whereas Arizona, despite a high infectious density, has a lower flow into Mississippi (2159). This targeted approach optimally reduces importation risks and complements other states' measures, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next two weeks."

Mississippi shows an extremely high infectious density but has a very low average daily inbound flow (1497) to New Mexico, limiting its impact on imported infections. Texas, despite its large inflow (99222), has low infectious density. Arizona has moderate infectious density but extremely high inflow (32596). Virginia presents a relatively high infectious density combined with a moderate inflow (2025). Considering detection utility, targeted screening of Virginia travelers would convert 90percent of exposed and infected individuals arriving into confirmed cases, effectively reducing hidden infectious importation. Though Arizona has a higher absolute flow, its infectious density is lower than Virginia¡¯s, and Mississippi¡¯s risk is mitigated by low flow. Targeting Virginia fills a gap in regional defense by addressing a secondary but significant source of risk rather than the obvious highest flow or density source, providing better systemic coverage of inbound risk. This strategic choice balances detection utility and coordination versus competition among states, aiming to reduce cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks.'

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Assessing the infectious risk from each origin state to Texas requires evaluating the infectious density defined as (E+I)/Population and the volume of inbound travelers. Arizona has an infectious density of approximately (61530+3917)/~9 million ¡Ö 0.0071, Mississippi shows a very high infectious density (40762+14740)/~600k ¡Ö 0.091, New Mexico has a low infectious density (3957+853)/~7.6 million ¡Ö 0.00063, and Virginia has a moderate infectious density (56247+13196)/~8.3 million ¡Ö 0.0085. Although Mississippi's infectious density is the highest, its inbound flow to Texas is moderate (~29,421 daily), while Virginia's infectious density is somewhat lower but still significant, and its inbound flow is also substantial (~24,277 daily). Arizona has the highest inbound flow (~51,399 daily) but slightly lower infectious density than Virginia. The detection utility is maximized by applying the 90percent screening to a state with a notable combination of infectious density and inbound flow to capture the most hidden infections (E and I), converting them to confirmed cases upon arrival and reducing hidden spread. Virginia stands out as a strategic choice: it has a relatively high infectious density coupled with a substantial inbound flow, offering a balanced opportunity to intercept hidden cases effectively. Targeting Virginia addresses a high-risk secondary source that might not be the obvious first choice like Mississippi with extremely high infectious density but smaller population and flow. This strategy fills a gap in regional defense by focusing on a state with considerable traffic and moderate infection rates, potentially reducing cumulative cases and deaths in Texas more effectively than screening only the highest infectious density state with fewer travelers. Therefore, implementing targeted inbound screening on travelers from Virginia for the next 14 days is recommended."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density among the origin states when considering the ratio of (E + I) to total population: (54622 + 20308) / 6606055 ¡Ö 0.0113, which is significantly greater than New Mexico (~0.00083), Texas (~0.0012), and Virginia (~0.0101). Despite a lower inbound flow (2279 daily) compared to Texas and New Mexico, the elevated infectious density indicates a disproportionate risk of importing hidden infections from Mississippi. Implementing targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi will effectively identify and quarantine approximately 90percent of exposed and infected individuals entering Arizona, substantially reducing the hidden infectious importation load. Although Texas has a much higher daily inflow (49267), its infectious density is relatively low, making the marginal benefit of targeting Texas less impactful per traveler screened. New Mexico, despite moderate inflow, has very low infectious density, thus posing a limited risk. Virginia's infectious density is close to Mississippi's but with a lower inflow (6174), making Mississippi the more critical source to target. This targeted policy complements regional defense by focusing on a high-risk state often overlooked due to its smaller flow, thereby filling a gap in epidemic control coordination rather than competing with likely policies targeting Texas or Virginia. Overall, directing resources to screen inbound travelers from Mississippi for 14 days optimally balances risk reduction and operational feasibility, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona."

2025-12-24 19:34:30,068 - od_agent - INFO - Region mississippi policy response:
 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, with (66437+15629)/approximately 8,146,215 = ~0.0101, which is substantially higher than Arizona (~0.0096), Texas (~0.0011), and New Mexico (~0.0008). Despite Texas having the largest absolute number of infected individuals, its infectious density is diluted by its large population. Virginia's daily inbound flow into Mississippi is moderate at 4465 travelers, making it a manageable target for screening enforcement. Implementing a targeted inbound screening at Virginia's entry points would capture approximately 90percent of their exposed and infected travelers who would otherwise enter Mississippi undetected. Given Virginia's high infectious density and significant interaction with Mississippi, this measure will reduce the hidden infectious importation effectively. Arizona, although having a high absolute number of infected, has a lower flow into Mississippi (2109), and New Mexico's infectious density and flow are comparatively low. Texas, despite the very high flow (38445), has a much lower infectious density and thus poses a relatively lower per-capita risk. Targeting Virginia balances detection utility and manageable enforcement workload. This targeted approach complements other states' potential policies by focusing on a high-risk, moderately trafficked origin state, creating a more comprehensive regional defense and minimizing importation risks without overwhelming screening resources."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for the origin states, Mississippi stands out with a very high infectious density of approximately 0.148 (E=54622 + I=20308) out of a population around 500,000, which is nearly 15percent. This is significantly higher than Arizona (~0.0099), Texas (~0.0011), and Virginia (~0.0102). Despite Mississippi contributing a relatively low average daily inbound flow into New Mexico (~1459), the extreme infectious density means each traveler from Mississippi carries a much higher risk of importing hidden infections. The screening intervention, with 90percent conversion of exposed and infected travelers to confirmed cases upon arrival, will effectively capture and isolate a substantial portion of these high-risk individuals, significantly reducing the silent seeding of infections in New Mexico from this source. Targeting Mississippi, a secondary and less obvious high-risk origin compared to large states like Texas or Arizona, fills a critical gap in regional defense that others might overlook, complementing broader efforts. This targeted approach balances risk and resource allocation by focusing on a smaller but disproportionately risky inflow, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks while avoiding the potentially overwhelming resource demand of screening larger inflows from states with lower infectious densities.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state, Mississippi stands out with a notably high infectious density: (E+I) = 54622 + 20308 = 74930 over a population of approximately 501901, yielding an infectious density of about 0.1492 or 14.92percent. In contrast, Arizona has an infectious density of (76275+4867)/~9,007,716 ¡Ö 0.0093 (0.93percent), New Mexico about (5539+1235)/~8,255,344 ¡Ö 0.00082 (0.082percent), and Virginia about (66437+15629)/~8,147,215 ¡Ö 0.0102 (1.02percent). Despite Mississippi's smaller population, its extremely high infectious density combined with a non-negligible average daily inbound flow of 30,676 travelers into Texas presents a significant risk vector for importing hidden infections. Implementing targeted inbound screening on Mississippi travelers allows identification and immediate quarantine of approximately 90percent of exposed and infected individuals among incoming travelers, dramatically reducing hidden infectious importation. Screening Arizona or Virginia would capture more absolute travelers due to higher flows but with a far lower infectious density, thus lower utility per traveler screened. New Mexico's infectious density and flow are both comparatively low, and thus less urgent. By targeting Mississippi, Texas addresses a critical regional gap in epidemic control, complementing other states' probable focus on larger, more populous sources. This targeted screening balances epidemiological risk and resource allocation efficiently to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi displays the highest infectious density, with (E+I) = 74930 over a population of approximately 810,548 (sum of given compartments), yielding an infectious density near 9.25percent. This is substantially higher than Arizona (~8.4percent), New Mexico (~0.08percent), and Texas (~0.1percent). The inbound flow from Mississippi to Virginia, although relatively low at 3551 daily travelers, carries a significant hidden infection risk due to this high infectious density. By enforcing a targeted inbound screening policy on Mississippi arrivals, we can convert 90percent of exposed and infected individuals into confirmed/quarantined status upon entry, substantially reducing the number of hidden infections entering Virginia's population. This focused screening on Mississippi addresses a critical gap in regional defense by targeting a highly infectious but less voluminous source, complementing potential efforts on larger but lower-risk origins like Texas or Arizona. This strategy optimally balances resource allocation and epidemiological impact, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Mississippi stands out as the highest risk origin state for inbound travel to Arizona due to its extremely high infectious density. Calculating infectious density as (E+I)/Population, Mississippi has (69451+26822)/6631471 ¡Ö 0.01425, significantly higher than New Mexico (~0.00105), Texas (~0.0013), and Virginia (~0.0113). Additionally, despite a relatively low average daily inflow of 1918 travelers to Arizona, the absolute number of hidden infections entering from Mississippi is non-negligible. Implementing a 90percent screening on inbound travelers from Mississippi will capture and convert a substantial portion of these exposed and infected individuals into the confirmed quarantine compartment, effectively reducing the hidden infectious pool entering Arizona. While Texas and Virginia have higher travel volumes, their infectious densities are considerably lower, making Mississippi the more efficient target for intervention from a risk reduction perspective. Targeting Mississippi addresses a critical gap in regional defense, as other states might focus on higher-volume states like Texas or Virginia, so this targeted screening balances coordination with other agents and maximizes impact on reducing imported hidden cases. Given the fixed 14-day policy duration, this focused approach will minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Arizona by greatly limiting the introduction of new infections from the highest-risk origin.'

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density for each origin state, we calculate (E+I)/Population: Arizona has (94102+5995)/9,086,707 ¡Ö 0.0110, New Mexico has (7632+1662)/9,063,924 ¡Ö 0.0010, Texas has (10112+16933)/21,165,258 ¡Ö 0.0013, and Virginia has (77202+18202)/8,054,423 ¡Ö 0.0116. Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density, slightly exceeding Arizona, indicating a significant hidden infectious risk per capita. Looking at inbound flows to Mississippi, Texas contributes the largest daily flow (~35,978), followed by Arizona (~2,086), Virginia (~4,247), and New Mexico (~1,158). While Texas has the largest volume, its infectious density is relatively low, thus its risk per traveler is lower. Virginia presents a moderate inbound flow coupled with the highest infectious density, making it a prime candidate for targeted screening. Implementing the 90percent screening policy on Virginia travelers would capture approximately 90percent of the exposed and infected individuals from this group, substantially reducing the hidden infectious population entering Mississippi. Choosing Virginia balances targeting a high per capita risk source with a moderate flow, filling a regional defense gap without overlapping the likely focus on Arizona or Texas by other states or agencies. Arizona, despite a similar infectious density to Virginia, has a much smaller inbound flow to Mississippi, reducing its overall impact. New Mexico's low infectious density and flow make it a less effective target. Therefore, restricting Virginia inbound travelers with enhanced screening is optimal to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next 14 days."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density defined as (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals notable differences. Arizona's infectious density is approximately (94102+5995)/~9,000,000 = ~0.0112, Texas has (10112+16933)/~20,845,931 ¡Ö 0.0013, Virginia's is (77202+18202)/~8,054,235 ¡Ö 0.0119, and Mississippi's infectious density is (69451+26822)/~469,213 ¡Ö 0.203, which is dramatically higher than other states, indicating a concentrated outbreak relative to its population size. Considering the inbound flows into New Mexico, Mississippi contributes only 1,137 travelers daily, which is low compared to Texas (79,863) and Arizona (31,372). However, the very high infectious density in Mississippi means that even small inflows carry substantial risk. By targeting Mississippi for inbound screening, the policy captures approximately 90percent of exposed and infected individuals arriving from the highest-risk state, converting them to confirmed cases (Q) and thus preventing hidden community transmission chains. This targeted approach supplements regional defenses by addressing a secondary but disproportionately risky source that might be overlooked if focus remained on higher-volume but lower-density states like Texas or Arizona. Screening Mississippi travelers balances resource allocation effectively, minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico, and fills a gap in multi-state epidemic control efforts, rather than competing by focusing only on the largest inflows. Therefore, imposing a targeted inbound screening on Mississippi optimally mitigates importation risks over the next 14 days."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population. With E=69451 and I=26822 over a population of approximately 469213 + 69451 + 26822 + 16139 + 153576 + 4017 (total ~728218), the infectious density is roughly 13.18percent, greatly surpassing other states. Although Arizona and Virginia have larger absolute numbers of exposed and infected individuals, their populations are also much larger, resulting in lower infectious densities (~1.19percent for Arizona and ~1.06percent for Virginia). New Mexico has the lowest infectious density (~0.10percent). The inbound flow from Mississippi to Texas is moderate (28922 daily), not the highest but significant enough to warrant attention. Implementing targeted inbound screening on Mississippi travelers would capture a substantial number of hidden infections: approximately 90percent of the exposed and infected individuals arriving from Mississippi would be identified and quarantined upon arrival, thereby reducing the risk of seeding new cases in Texas. This policy targets a secondary source of risk that might be under-addressed by other states focusing on higher-volume or higher-population origins, thus complementing broader regional efforts and filling a gap in defense. Given Texas's large susceptible population and ongoing local infections, mitigating importation from a high infectious density origin like Mississippi is crucial to slowing cumulative cases and deaths over the next two weeks."

This is significantly higher than Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, which have much larger populations diluting their E+I counts, resulting in lower infectious densities. Moreover, the daily inbound flow from Mississippi to Virginia is 3,545, which, while lower than Texas (21,662) and Arizona (4,496), still represents a meaningful vector of potential disease importation. The screening¡¯s detection utility is high here because rigorous 90percent screening will convert a substantial fraction of these hidden infections into confirmed cases (Q), effectively reducing the risk of covert transmission within Virginia. Targeting Mississippi fills a critical gap in regional defense by focusing on a smaller but highly infectious source state that might be overlooked due to its lower absolute flow compared to Texas or Arizona. This approach optimizes the benefit of limited screening resources by addressing a disproportionately high-risk origin rather than competing on the obvious but lower relative risk large states.

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population = (85761+34651)/6630556 ¡Ö 0.0303 or 3.03percent, which is significantly higher than New Mexico (~0.0013), Texas (~0.0012), and Virginia (~0.0036). Despite a moderate inbound flow to Arizona (1900 daily), the absolute number of potentially infectious travelers is substantial: approximately 85,761 exposed plus 34,651 infected individuals in Mississippi's population, indicating a high risk of hidden infections arriving in Arizona. Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy for Mississippi travelers would enable rigorous 90percent detection and conversion of exposed and infected individuals into confirmed cases upon arrival, substantially reducing Arizona's hidden infectious inflow from this high-risk source. While Texas has the highest inbound flow (50,257), its infectious density is much lower, reducing the relative risk per traveler. New Mexico and Virginia have moderate infectious densities and flows but are less risky than Mississippi. Focusing on Mississippi addresses a critical gap by targeting the most infectious and risky origin state, complementing possible policies by other states and optimizing Arizona's epidemic control. This measure balances effectiveness and resource allocation, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths over the next two weeks in Arizona."

 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state highlights Arizona as having the highest risk import profile: Arizona's infectious density is approximately (114512+7278)/(8522698+114512+7278+167737+247028+5133)=~0.013 (about 1.3percent), which is higher than New Mexico (~0.0013), Texas (~0.0011), and Virginia (~0.014 but with a smaller inflow). Moreover, Arizona's average daily inbound flow into Mississippi is 2050, which, while smaller than Texas, still represents a significant potential vector for importation of hidden infectious individuals. Applying a rigorous 90percent screening on Arizona travelers would effectively detect and quarantine a substantial fraction of exposed and infected individuals, significantly reducing the hidden infectious import into Mississippi. Texas, despite its massive inflow (35622), has a notably lower infectious density, so screening there yields less marginal benefit relative to operational cost and feasibility. Virginia has a moderate infectious density but lower inflow. New Mexico's infectious density and inflow are both low, rendering screening less impactful. Targeting Arizona is a strategic choice balancing risk and impact: it addresses a high infectious density source with moderate inflow, filling a critical gap in regional defenses. This targeted inbound screening reduces Mississippi's imported hidden infections, thus minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths over the 14-day horizon. Hence, Arizona is selected for the targeted inbound screening policy to optimize disease control outcomes."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Assessing the infectious density of each origin state relative to its population and inflow into New Mexico reveals critical insights. Mississippi exhibits a notably high infectious density with (E+I) at 120,412 over a population of approximately 863,000, yielding an infectious density of about 13.95percent. This is substantially higher than Arizona (~1.42percent), Texas (~0.12percent), and Virginia (~1.38percent). Although Mississippi's inbound flow to New Mexico is low (~1,129 daily), the high density of hidden infections (E and I) means even small inflows risk substantial seeding of new cases. Targeting Mississippi allows intercepting a large fraction of these hidden infections through rigorous 90percent screening, effectively converting exposed and infected travelers into confirmed cases (Q) upon arrival, sharply reducing undetected importations. This choice balances risk and practicality: while Arizona and Texas have much higher absolute inflows, their infectious densities are lower, diluting the per-traveler risk. Screening Mississippi fills a regional defense gap by controlling a high-risk but less-obvious source that might be overlooked by other states focusing on more populous neighbors. This targeted intervention minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks by preemptively quarantining a disproportionate share of incoming hidden infections from a high-risk origin, optimizing limited resources for maximal epidemic control impact."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state shows that Mississippi has the highest infectious density among the options. Calculating approximate infectious densities: Arizona has (114512+7278)/~10 million ¡Ö 0.0122, Mississippi has (85761+34651)/~400 thousand ¡Ö 0.0503 which is significantly higher, New Mexico has (10064+2130)/~9.8 million ¡Ö 0.00125, and Virginia has (88057+20810)/~8 million ¡Ö 0.0136. Despite Mississippi's smaller population, its very high infectious density combined with a substantial average daily inbound flow of 28,405 travelers into Texas presents a significant risk of importing hidden infections. Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy on Mississippi travelers will rigorously identify 90percent of Exposed and Infected individuals, substantially reducing the hidden infectious population entering Texas from this high-risk source. This approach prioritizes mitigating a critical gap in regional defense by focusing on a secondary but highly risky origin rather than the larger but relatively less infectious Arizona or Virginia. New Mexico's lower infectious density and despite higher inflow does not present as high a risk as Mississippi. Thus, targeting Mississippi balances the detection utility and systemic risk reduction effectively to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas over the next two weeks."

By screening 90percent of arrivals from Mississippi and converting exposed and infected travelers directly to confirmed and isolated status, the policy can effectively intercept a substantial portion of hidden infection importations. This targeted approach focuses on a high-risk but moderate flow source, filling a gap in regional defense where others might prioritize high-volume but much lower prevalence states like Texas. This strategy balances detection utility and resource allocation efficiently, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two weeks. Notably, no other state has such a high infectious density combined with a non-negligible inbound flow, justifying Mississippi as the optimal choice for targeted inbound screening.'

2025-12-24 19:35:54,187 - od_agent - INFO - Region arizona policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, with approximately 120,580 infectious individuals (E=85426, I=35154) over a population of about 6,450,200 (sum of given compartments), yielding an infectious density significantly higher than the others. Mississippi's inbound flow to Arizona, though moderate at 2,184 daily travelers, represents a critical vector for introducing hidden infections. Implementing targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi will detect and quarantine approximately 90percent of the infectious arrivals, effectively reducing the hidden infectious population entering Arizona from this high-risk source. New Mexico and Texas have much larger inbound flows (46,636 and 59,869 respectively) but possess considerably lower infectious densities, leading to a less efficient use of screening resources if targeted there. Virginia has a moderate infectious density but a smaller inbound flow. By focusing on Mississippi, Arizona fills a regional defense gap, as this high-risk source may be overlooked by other states due to its smaller size and flow, while larger states like Texas and New Mexico might be more commonly targeted. This targeted approach balances detection utility and systemic risk reduction to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona over the next two weeks."

2025-12-24 19:35:58,402 - od_agent - INFO - Region mississippi policy response:
 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Arizona exhibits the highest infectious density calculated as (E+I)/Population, with approximately 144,028 infectious individuals out of roughly 8,147,564 total population, yielding about 0.0177 infectious density. This is significantly higher than Virginia (~0.0168), New Mexico (~0.00156), and Texas (~0.0012). Arizona's daily inbound flow into Mississippi is moderate (1891), which means implementing targeted screening there can effectively reduce imported hidden infections without overwhelming resource allocation. The detection utility from Arizona¡¯s travelers is substantial; screening 90percent of inbound travelers from Arizona would convert a large fraction of exposed and infected individuals into confirmed cases, thus preventing silent community spread. While Virginia also has a high infectious density, its inbound flow is lower (4629) and infectious density slightly lower than Arizona, making Arizona the more critical source to target. Texas and New Mexico show much lower infectious densities despite higher or comparable flows, yielding less impact from screening. Choosing Arizona addresses the most obvious high-risk source, aligning with regional epidemic control priorities and maximizing reduction of imported infections. This targeted approach balances effective intervention and resource constraints, without unnecessary broad restrictions or duplicating efforts on lower-risk flows, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="In evaluating inbound traffic risk to New Mexico, we assess each origin state's infectious density defined as (E+I)/Population. Mississippi presents a notably high infectious density with (85426+35154)/(425633+85426+35154+24926+206300+4637) approximately 0.20, much higher than Arizona (~0.017), Texas (~0.00086), and Virginia (~0.0041). Despite its low absolute inbound flow (1008 daily), Mississippi's high infectious density means even a small number of arrivals could disproportionately increase hidden infections entering New Mexico. Screening at this origin would convert 90percent of the exposed and infected travelers into confirmed cases upon arrival, effectively reducing silent seeding of infections. For instance, 90percent of the estimated hidden infections in the inbound flow from Mississippi would be quarantined, substantially reducing transmission risk. Arizona and Texas have much higher inbound flows but considerably lower infectious densities, thus screening them would involve much larger operational efforts with proportionally less impact on hidden infection importation. Virginia also has a higher infectious density than Arizona and Texas but a very low inbound flow, making it less impactful. Targeting Mississippi fills a critical gap in regional defense by addressing a high-risk but relatively overlooked source, balancing screening resource allocation effectively and minimizing New Mexico¡¯s cumulative cases and deaths over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state, Mississippi exhibits a notably high infectious density. Mississippi's exposed (E=85426) and infected (I=35154) populations combined represent a substantial fraction of its total population (~350,000+), indicating a significant hidden infectious reservoir. Despite a lower absolute inbound flow (38,606 daily) into Texas compared to New Mexico or Arizona, the proportion of infectious individuals among travelers from Mississippi is relatively high, making it a critical source for importation risk. Implementing targeted inbound screening on Mississippi travelers would enable detection and quarantine of approximately 90percent of E and I individuals, effectively reducing the hidden importation of infection. While Arizona and Virginia have large inbound flows, their infectious densities are comparatively lower, and New Mexico's infectious density is modest with a larger flow. Selecting Mississippi balances focusing on a high-risk source that may be under-targeted by other states, filling a regional defense gap rather than competing for obvious targets like Arizona. This targeted intervention is expected to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by intercepting a disproportionate number of hidden infections entering Texas, optimizing resource allocation for screening without expending efforts on lower-risk states. Thus, imposing a strict 90percent screening on inbound travelers from Mississippi for 14 days is the recommended policy."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to target Mississippi for inbound screening is based on a detailed risk and utility assessment. Mississippi exhibits a very high infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population with E=85426 and I=35154 over a population of approximately 425633+85426+35154+24926+206300+4637=about 770,000, yielding roughly 15.21percent infectious density, which is substantially higher than other origin states. This indicates a severe hidden infectious burden entering Virginia from Mississippi. The average daily inbound flow from Mississippi is 4148 travelers, a moderate volume compared to Texas (23877) and Arizona (5103), but with a much higher infectious density, screening here promises significant detection utility. Specifically, rigorous 90percent screening can identify approximately 90percent of these exposed and infected travelers, drastically reducing hidden infectious importation and subsequent community spread. Arizona and Texas, despite large traveler volumes, have lower infectious densities (~1.6percent and ~0.12percent respectively), thus screening them yields comparatively less impact per traveler. New Mexico has low infectious density and low inbound flow, making it a less effective target. Selecting Mississippi also strategically fills a regional defense gap by addressing a less obvious but disproportionately risky source, complementing potential policies by other states targeting larger but lower-risk origins. Therefore, focusing screening on Mississippi is the optimal targeted inbound policy to minimize Virginia's cumulative confirmed cases and deaths over the next two weeks."
