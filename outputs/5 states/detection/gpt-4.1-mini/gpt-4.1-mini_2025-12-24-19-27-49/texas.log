Virginia's exposed (1825) plus infected (3189) totals 5014 cases out of a population of 8,524,995, yielding an infectious density of approximately 0.000588, which is higher than Arizona (~0.000394), Mississippi (~0.000885 but with much smaller inflow), and New Mexico (~0.00101 but with moderate inflow). However, Virginia's absolute infectious population combined with its daily inbound flow of about 13,780 travelers to Texas results in the largest influx of potentially infectious individuals. By implementing a targeted inbound screening policy on travelers from Virginia, we can capture 90% of the exposed and infected individuals entering Texas, significantly reducing the hidden infectious population crossing the border. This intervention captures the highest number of hidden infections due to the combination of a relatively high infection density and a substantial travel volume, thereby minimizing the risk of seeding new infections in Texas. Choosing Virginia over others strategically fills a critical gap since other states like New Mexico have moderate infectious density but higher inflows, yet their infectious population is smaller in absolute terms. Mississippi, despite having a high infectious density, has a far lower inflow to Texas, limiting the policy impact. Arizona has a large population but lower infectious density and a smaller inflow to Texas. Thus, targeting Virginia aligns with maximizing detection utility and systemic risk reduction, even if other agents may focus on states with high infection densities but lower travel volume. Overall, this focused screening on Virginia inbound travelers for the next 14 days best balances infection importation risk and policy effectiveness to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas."

  "global_guidance": "Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population. With E=69451 and I=26822 over a population of approximately 469213 + 69451 + 26822 + 16139 + 153576 + 4017 (total ~728218), the infectious density is roughly 13.18%, greatly surpassing other states. Although Arizona and Virginia have larger absolute numbers of exposed and infected individuals, their populations are also much larger, resulting in lower infectious densities (~1.19% for Arizona and ~1.06% for Virginia). New Mexico has the lowest infectious density (~0.10%). The inbound flow from Mississippi to Texas is moderate (28922 daily), not the highest but significant enough to warrant attention. Implementing targeted inbound screening on Mississippi travelers would capture a substantial number of hidden infections: approximately 90% of the exposed and infected individuals arriving from Mississippi would be identified and quarantined upon arrival, thereby reducing the risk of seeding new cases in Texas. This policy targets a secondary source of risk that might be under-addressed by other states focusing on higher-volume or higher-population origins, thus complementing broader regional efforts and filling a gap in defense. Given Texas's large susceptible population and ongoing local infections, mitigating importation from a high infectious density origin like Mississippi is crucial to slowing cumulative cases and deaths over the next two weeks."

  "global_guidance": "Analyzing the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state, Mississippi exhibits a notably high infectious density. Mississippi's exposed (E=85426) and infected (I=35154) populations combined represent a substantial fraction of its total population (~350,000+), indicating a significant hidden infectious reservoir. Despite a lower absolute inbound flow (38,606 daily) into Texas compared to New Mexico or Arizona, the proportion of infectious individuals among travelers from Mississippi is relatively high, making it a critical source for importation risk. Implementing targeted inbound screening on Mississippi travelers would enable detection and quarantine of approximately 90% of E and I individuals, effectively reducing the hidden importation of infection. While Arizona and Virginia have large inbound flows, their infectious densities are comparatively lower, and New Mexico's infectious density is modest with a larger flow. Selecting Mississippi balances focusing on a high-risk source that may be under-targeted by other states, filling a regional defense gap rather than competing for obvious targets like Arizona. This targeted intervention is expected to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by intercepting a disproportionate number of hidden infections entering Texas, optimizing resource allocation for screening without expending efforts on lower-risk states. Thus, imposing a strict 90% screening on inbound travelers from Mississippi for 14 days is the recommended policy."
