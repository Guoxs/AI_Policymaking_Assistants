Although New Mexico and Texas contribute higher inbound flows to Arizona, their infectious densities are much lower, resulting in fewer hidden infections entering despite volume. Mississippi's inbound flow to Arizona is moderate at 2382 daily, but given its very high infection prevalence, it represents a disproportionately high risk of importing exposed and infected individuals. Implementing targeted inbound screening on Mississippi travelers will convert about 90% of these hidden infections to confirmed cases upon arrival, thereby substantially reducing the risk of silent spread within Arizona. This approach prioritizes addressing the highest risk origin rather than the highest volume, effectively filling a critical gap in regional defense. Other states with larger flows but lower infectious densities pose less immediate threat per traveler and may be addressed by baseline protocols.

Calculating infectious density as (E+I)/Population, Mississippi has (69451+26822)/6631471 「 0.01425, significantly higher than New Mexico (~0.00105), Texas (~0.0013), and Virginia (~0.0113). Additionally, despite a relatively low average daily inflow of 1918 travelers to Arizona, the absolute number of hidden infections entering from Mississippi is non-negligible. Implementing a 90% screening on inbound travelers from Mississippi will capture and convert a substantial portion of these exposed and infected individuals into the confirmed quarantine compartment, effectively reducing the hidden infectious pool entering Arizona. While Texas and Virginia have higher travel volumes, their infectious densities are considerably lower, making Mississippi the more efficient target for intervention from a risk reduction perspective. Targeting Mississippi addresses a critical gap in regional defense, as other states might focus on higher-volume states like Texas or Virginia, so this targeted screening balances coordination with other agents and maximizes impact on reducing imported hidden cases. Given the fixed 14-day policy duration, this focused approach will minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Arizona by greatly limiting the introduction of new infections from the highest-risk origin."

Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy for Mississippi travelers would enable rigorous 90% detection and conversion of exposed and infected individuals into confirmed cases upon arrival, substantially reducing Arizona's hidden infectious inflow from this high-risk source. While Texas has the highest inbound flow (50,257), its infectious density is much lower, reducing the relative risk per traveler. New Mexico and Virginia have moderate infectious densities and flows but are less risky than Mississippi. Focusing on Mississippi addresses a critical gap by targeting the most infectious and risky origin state, complementing possible policies by other states and optimizing Arizona's epidemic control.
