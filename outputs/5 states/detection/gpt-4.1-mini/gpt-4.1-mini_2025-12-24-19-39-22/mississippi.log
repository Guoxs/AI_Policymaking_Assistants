Though Arizona has slightly higher infectious density, its inbound flow to Mississippi is very low (2050 daily), limiting its importation risk. Texas has a large inbound flow (35622 daily) but moderate infectious density. Virginia combines a relatively high infectious density with moderate inbound flow (3845 daily), making it the state with the highest risk of importing hidden infections. Screening at Virginia¨s inbound flow (3845 travelers daily) with 90% detection of E and I means a significant number of hidden infections will be identified and isolated, thus reducing silent seeding. Choosing Virginia as the target balances the risk and flow more effectively than Arizona, which despite high density has minimal flow, or Texas, which has high flow but lower infectious density. This strategic targeting complements regional efforts by focusing on a secondary yet significant infection source, thereby filling a gap in border disease control to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next 14 days."

Implementing targeted inbound screening for travelers from Arizona will capture and convert approximately 90% of the exposed and infected individuals entering Mississippi, substantially reducing the hidden infectious population that could seed new cases locally. Although Virginia has a comparable infectious density, its inflow is lower (4,629), and Texas, despite a high inflow (47,560), has a lower infectious density, making Arizona the optimal target. This choice prioritizes mitigating the most significant risk source and complements broader regional control efforts by focusing on a high-risk but less obvious origin, filling a strategic gap. Thus, targeting Arizona balances high infectious risk and manageable traveler volume to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next two weeks."
