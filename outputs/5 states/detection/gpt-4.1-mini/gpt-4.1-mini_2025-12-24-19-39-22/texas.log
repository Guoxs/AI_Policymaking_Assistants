However, Mississippi has a notably high infectious density but its inbound flow to Texas is lower (28922) compared to Virginia (25030) and New Mexico (134761). The daily inbound flow from Virginia is moderate, making it a strategic target where screening can be most effective in reducing hidden infections. Screening 90% of exposed and infected travelers from Virginia can significantly reduce the influx of hidden infections into Texas, effectively converting a large fraction of those into confirmed cases (Q), thus better isolating them and reducing community spread. Although Arizona has a large infectious population, its inbound flow to Texas is lower (45426) than New Mexico's (134761), but New Mexico's infectious density is much lower, reducing the benefit of screening there. Targeting Virginia balances risk and mobility volume to maximize detection utility. Choosing Virginia also complements other states' policies by focusing on a significant but less obvious source, filling regional defense gaps rather than competing on the highest-risk origin. This targeted screening policy will help minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas by intercepting a substantial portion of incoming hidden infections over the next 14 days."

  "global_guidance": "The decision to implement targeted inbound screening focuses on Mississippi due to its notably high infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, which is approximately (84810+34289)/(430573+84810+34289+20968+176546+4314) 「 0.28, indicating a very high proportion of hidden infections relative to its population compared to other states. Although Arizona and Virginia have larger absolute numbers, their infectious densities are lower and their inbound flows to Texas are also significantly less than Mississippi's. New Mexico has a moderate infectious density but much lower E and I values and a higher inbound flow, which would dilute the screening impact. By selecting Mississippi, the screening will capture a substantial portion of hidden infections; with 90% detection efficacy applied to the average daily inbound flow of 28,405 travelers, a significant number of exposed or infected individuals will be rerouted to confirmed quarantine status upon arrival, effectively reducing Texas's importation risk. This choice also complements regional defense strategies by addressing a secondary but high-risk source, rather than overlapping with potentially more obvious high-volume states like Arizona or New Mexico, balancing coordination with other states' policies. Thus, targeting Mississippi optimizes the reduction of cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas over the next 14 days."

  "global_guidance": "In evaluating the risk profiles of origin states to Texas, Mississippi stands out due to its extremely high infectious density despite a smaller population size. Calculating infectious density as (E+I)/Population, Mississippi's exposed plus infected total is 118989 out of roughly 560,000 people (sum of all compartments), yielding a very high infection prevalence compared to other states. Arizona and Virginia also have large absolute numbers but much larger populations, resulting in lower infectious densities. New Mexico shows the lowest infectious density among these. The inbound flow from Mississippi to Texas is 38,606 daily on average, which is moderate but significant. Implementing targeted inbound screening on Mississippi travelers would capture approximately 90% of the exposed and infected individuals attempting entry, which translates into a substantial reduction of hidden infections entering Texas due to the high prevalence in Mississippi. This targeted approach effectively reduces disease importation risk from the highest-risk origin in terms of infection density and hidden infectious population per traveler. Choosing Mississippi also fills a gap in regional defense because other agents might prioritize larger states like Arizona or Virginia due to their population size and mobility volume, but Mississippi¨s high infectious density and moderate flow make it a critical secondary source to control. Thus, restricting inbound travelers from Mississippi with rigorous screening maximizes detection utility and minimizes disease importation risk, helping curb cumulative cases and deaths in Texas over the next 14 days."
