2025-12-24 19:39:29,147 - od_agent - INFO - Region arizona policy response:
 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density among the origin states, with (E+I)/Population approximately 0.00058, which surpasses Mississippi, New Mexico, and Texas, making it the riskiest source for importing hidden infections into Arizona. The daily inbound flow from Virginia to Arizona is 3171, which, combined with Virginia's high infectious density, results in a significant number of exposed and infected travelers entering Arizona. Implementing a 90percent screening and detection policy targeting Virginia would effectively convert most of these hidden infections (E and I compartments) into confirmed cases (Q) upon arrival, drastically reducing the potential for undetected community spread. Compared to Texas and New Mexico, which have higher inbound flows but lower infectious densities, and Mississippi with moderate risk, Virginia represents a critical gap in regional defense that Arizona can uniquely address. This targeted approach balances the need to mitigate imported risk without overextending resources on states with lower relative risk. No other origin state presents a better trade-off between infectious density and inbound flow for intervention, hence selecting Virginia optimizes Arizona's epidemic control efforts over the next two weeks."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density ((E+I)/Population) of each origin state reveals the relative risk of importing hidden infections into Mississippi. Virginia has the highest infectious density with (1825+3189)/~8524995 「 0.00059, significantly higher than Arizona (~0.00039), New Mexico (~0.00099), and Texas (~0.00004). While New Mexico has a slightly higher infectious density than Arizona, its inbound flow to Mississippi is much lower (1425 vs. 1551). Texas, despite high inflow (24412), has very low infectious density. Virginia's moderate inflow (2260) combined with the highest infectious density suggests it contributes more hidden infections per traveler. Implementing targeted inbound screening on Virginia travelers will capture approximately 90percent of these hidden infections (E+I) upon entry, converting them to confirmed (Q) cases and thus significantly reducing undetected community seeding. This focused intervention is chosen over the obvious large flow from Texas because Texas's infectious density is very low, offering less benefit from screening. Targeting Virginia fills a regional defense gap by addressing a state with high infection prevalence relative to its flow, thereby minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Mississippi more effectively. Coordination with other states likely targets larger or more apparent sources; this policy complements such efforts by focusing on a secondary yet high-risk source."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="In assessing the risk profile of origin states for inbound travel to New Mexico, the infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, is key. Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density among the candidates, with (1825+3189)/8524995 「 0.00059, surpassing Arizona at 「0.00039, Mississippi at 「0.00091, and Texas at 「0.000043. Despite Mississippi's slightly higher infectious density, its daily inbound flow to New Mexico is very low (942), limiting total importation risk. Virginia, while having a moderate inbound flow of 1385 travelers daily into New Mexico, presents a significant risk due to its high number of exposed and infected individuals relative to population. Screening and detection utility is maximized by targeting Virginia because a rigorous 90percent screening will identify and quarantine a substantial portion of hidden infections entering from this source, effectively reducing transmission chains initiated by these inbound travelers. While Arizona and Texas contribute larger traveler volumes, their lower infectious densities mean fewer hidden infections intercepted per traveler screened. Choosing Virginia fills a critical gap in regional defense, as other states may focus on high-volume but lower-risk sources, and New Mexico can uniquely mitigate risk from this moderately sized but high-infection source. This targeted screening aligns with epidemic control goals to minimize new confirmed cases and deaths, justifying the policy to implement a 14-day targeted inbound screening mandate specifically for travelers from Virginia."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Virginia shows the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population = (1825+3189)/8524995 「 0.00059, which is notably higher than Arizona (~0.00039), Mississippi (~0.00088), and New Mexico (~0.001). However, New Mexico's infectious density is slightly higher (~0.001), but its inbound flow to Texas is substantially larger (84217 daily) compared to Virginia's 13780. Despite New Mexico having a higher infectious density and larger flow, Virginia¨s combination of high infectious density and significant inbound flow represents a critical risk vector. The 90percent screening at Virginia's border would convert a substantial portion of exposed and infected travelers into confirmed cases upon arrival, effectively diminishing hidden infectious entries. Specifically, with 13780 daily inflow and roughly 0.00059 infectious density, the screening would identify a significant number of hidden infections, mitigating community spread. Targeting Virginia addresses a high-risk corridor that might be overlooked if focusing solely on the largest flow state (New Mexico) due to potential overlapping measures by other agents or states. This strategic selection balances risk reduction and resource focus, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas during the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density ((E+I)/Population) for each origin state, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density among the candidates, approximately 0.00088, higher than Arizona (~0.00039), New Mexico (~0.00103 but with much lower inbound flow), and Texas (~0.00004). Although New Mexico has a slightly higher infectious density (~0.00103), its inbound flow to Virginia is very low (1004) compared to Mississippi (2401) and Arizona (3665). Mississippi's combination of moderately high infectious density and a non-negligible inbound flow makes it a critical source of potential hidden infections. Implementing targeted screening on inbound travelers from Mississippi will thus capture a meaningful number of exposed and infected individuals, estimated at about 0.9*(E+I)*inbound flow per day, significantly reducing the hidden infectious load entering Virginia. This focused intervention balances coordination with other states that might target very large sources like Arizona or Texas and fills a gap by addressing a mid-tier risk source that could otherwise seed new infections. The screening would reduce the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two weeks by cutting off a substantial hidden infection pathway and complement broader regional epidemic control efforts."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the four origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, with (3320+1783)/5486976 「 0.00094, which is significantly higher than New Mexico (~0.00036), Texas (~0.00007), and Virginia (~0.00058). Although Texas has the largest inbound flow into Arizona (27,201 daily), its infectious density is relatively low. Mississippi, despite a moderate inbound flow (1,524 daily), poses a disproportionately high risk due to its elevated prevalence of exposed and infected individuals. Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy on travelers from Mississippi would therefore capture and convert approximately 90percent of these hidden infections (E and I) into confirmed cases (Q) upon arrival, substantially reducing the importation of undetected infectious individuals into Arizona. This policy strategically addresses a high-risk but somewhat overlooked source, complementing possible interventions from other agents that may focus on higher-volume states like Texas or New Mexico. By focusing on Mississippi, Arizona can efficiently leverage its limited screening resources to mitigate cumulative confirmed cases and deaths over the next two weeks, balancing risk and resource allocation while enhancing regional epidemic control coordination.'

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density of each origin state, we calculate (E+I)/Population to assess relative risk. Arizona's infectious density is approximately 0.000041, New Mexico's about 0.00036, Texas around 0.000045, and Virginia approximately 0.000059, making Virginia the highest infectious density source. Considering inbound flows into Mississippi, Virginia sends 3005 travelers daily, which is moderate compared to Texas (31103) but with a higher infectious density. Screening travelers from Virginia will identify 90percent of their hidden infections (E+I), effectively converting exposed and infected individuals into confirmed cases upon arrival, reducing unnoticed transmission risk. Targeting Virginia addresses a high-risk source that might be less obvious than Texas due to Texas's large volume but lower infectious density, thus filling a regional defense gap against importation of cases. Arizona and New Mexico have lower infectious densities and inbound flows, offering less impact if targeted. Therefore, implementing targeted inbound screening for Virginia effectively balances risk and travel volume to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next 14 days."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Evaluating the infectious density ((E+I)/Population) for each origin state, Mississippi exhibits the highest rate with approximately (3320+1783)/7,300,000 「 0.0007, which is significantly higher than Arizona (~0.0004), Texas (~0.00007), and Virginia (~0.00059). Despite its smaller inbound flow into New Mexico (1230 daily), the high infectious density means each traveler has a relatively greater risk of being infectious. Implementing targeted inbound screening at Mississippi arrivals could intercept approximately 90percent of the hidden infections (E and I) from this source, effectively reducing the imported hidden infectious population and mitigating downstream community spread. Arizona and Virginia, while having higher flows, have lower infectious densities and thus a lower per-traveler risk; Texas has the largest inbound flow but a much lower infectious density, diluting its relative risk. Targeting Mississippi fills a critical gap by controlling a high-risk, smaller volume source that might otherwise be overlooked if focusing only on high-volume states. This approach balances coordination by addressing a secondary yet significant threat, complementing potential policies from neighboring states that might prioritize larger traffic sources. Therefore, instituting a 14-day rigorous screening mandate for travelers from Mississippi optimally minimizes cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico by cutting off a high-risk importation channel early.'

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals that Virginia has the highest infectious density among the options: (4043+983)/8525943 「 0.00059, compared to Arizona (2857+185)/7365717 「 0.00042, Mississippi (3320+1783)/2925416 「 0.00176, and New Mexico (715+153)/2396032 「 0.00036. However, Mississippi's infectious density is notably higher at approximately 0.00176, but its average daily inbound flow to Texas is lower (24904) compared to Virginia's inflow (16423). Virginia's infectious density combined with a moderately high inbound flow means it contributes a significant hidden infectious population into Texas. Screening at Virginia's inbound flow, with a rigorous 90percent detection, would capture a substantial number of hidden cases (E+I) estimated by multiplying infectious density by inflow, then applying 90percent detection. This targeted screening will help reduce undetected imported cases, effectively shifting them into confirmed quarantine (Q), limiting further community spread in Texas. While Mississippi has a higher infectious density, its lower daily inflow makes the impact of screening less significant. Arizona and New Mexico have lower infectious densities and/or inflows, making them less critical targets. Choosing Virginia aligns with filling a regional defense gap, as other agents may target states with more obvious high risk like Mississippi, while Virginia presents a balanced but impactful target. This approach minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas by addressing a significant source of hidden infections without overextending resources."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Analyzing the infectious density ((E+I)/Population) of each origin state reveals that Mississippi has the highest risk with (3320+1783)/2925416 「 0.00177, significantly above Arizona (~0.00042), New Mexico (~0.00036), and Texas (~0.00007). The inbound flow from Mississippi to Virginia is moderate at 3440 daily travelers, meaning a focused screening here can intercept a substantial number of hidden infections. Applying a 90percent screening capture rate on the exposed and infected inbound population, we estimate removing approximately 0.9 * (E+I)/Population * inflow = 0.9 * 0.00177 * 3440 「 5.5 hidden infectious individuals daily from entry, which over 14 days translates to about 77 potential infections detected and quarantined early, significantly reducing silent community spread. Targeting Mississippi addresses a less obvious but higher per-capita infectious risk source than the larger Texas inflow with lower infectious density. This targeted approach complements potential broader regional controls and fills a gap where other states might focus on larger-volume but lower-risk origins. Therefore, prioritizing Mississippi maximizes detection utility relative to risk and flow, optimally reducing new confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two weeks.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state relative to arizona, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density with (5704+2648)/5834803 「 0.00143, substantially higher than New Mexico (~0.00029), Texas (~0.00010), and Virginia (~0.00075). Although Texas and Virginia have larger populations and inflows, their infectious densities are comparatively lower. Mississippi's daily inbound flow to Arizona is 1474, a moderate but significant volume of travelers who may carry hidden infections. By imposing a targeted inbound screening policy on travelers from Mississippi with 90percent screening efficacy, we can effectively identify and quarantine a large portion of exposed and infected individuals (E+I), preventing these hidden infections from seeding further transmission chains in Arizona. This targeted approach addresses a high-risk source that might be underprioritized by other states focusing on larger but less dense origins like Texas or Virginia. Given that New Mexico's inflow is much higher but infectious density is low, and Texas has large flows but lower infectious density, Mississippi represents the most impactful and efficient leverage point for inbound screening to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Arizona over the next two weeks."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals Virginia as the highest risk source. Virginia's infectious density is approximately (5186+1207)/~9,000,000 「 0.00071, significantly higher than Texas (~0.00010), Arizona (~0.00005), and New Mexico (~0.00029). Despite Texas having a large absolute number of infected individuals, its infectious density is relatively low given its large population. The inbound flow from Virginia to Mississippi averages 2877 daily, which is moderate but non-negligible. Implementing targeted inbound screening on Virginia travelers will detect and quarantine roughly 90percent of exposed and infected arrivals, effectively reducing hidden infections entering Mississippi from this moderately sized but high-risk source. Arizona and New Mexico have lower infectious densities and/or smaller inbound flows, making screening less impactful. Texas, while having a large number of infected individuals, has a lower infectious density and a very high flow, making full screening challenging and potentially less efficient given resources. Targeting Virginia fills a regional defense gap by focusing on a smaller but higher-risk state that may be overlooked by other regions prioritizing larger states like Texas. This targeted approach optimally balances detection utility and resource allocation to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next 14 days."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density, Mississippi exhibits the highest ratio of exposed and infected individuals relative to its population: (E+I)/Population = (5704+2648)/8,498,160 「 0.00098, which is significantly higher than Arizona (~0.00045), Texas (~0.0001), and Virginia (~0.00075). Although Texas contributes the largest absolute inbound flow to New Mexico (75,115 daily), its infectious density is relatively low. Mississippi's inbound flow to New Mexico is much smaller (1,233 daily), but its high infectious density means even this smaller flow carries a higher per capita risk of importing hidden infections. Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy for travelers from Mississippi will intercept approximately 90percent of exposed and infected entrants, effectively converting them to confirmed cases upon arrival and reducing hidden infectious importation. This targeted intervention fills a crucial gap by focusing on a secondary but high-risk source that might be overlooked if only the largest flows or most obvious high-risk states like Texas were targeted. This strategic choice balances risk mitigation with resource allocation, minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico by sharply reducing high-risk importations, and complements broader regional efforts that may prioritize larger states. Hence, screening travelers from Mississippi is the most effective and efficient measure for the next 14 days to slow disease spread in New Mexico."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density ((E+I)/Population) with (5186+1207)/8518294 「 0.00075, which is notably higher than Arizona (4252/7519904 「 0.00057), Mississippi (8352/2849808 「 0.00293), and New Mexico (811/2829361 「 0.00029). While Mississippi has a high infectious density, its daily inbound flow into Texas (26190) is moderate compared to New Mexico (124957), Arizona (35167), and Virginia (16543). New Mexico has the highest inbound flow but a relatively low infectious density. Virginia has a moderately high infectious density and a notable inbound flow of 16543 to Texas daily, making it a critical source of potential hidden infections. Targeting Virginia for screening will capture approximately 90percent of the exposed and infected travelers arriving from there, significantly reducing the hidden infectious import. This will directly lower the seeding of new infections in Texas. Although Mississippi has a higher infectious density, its inbound traffic is lower and New Mexico's large flow but low infectious density makes it less risky per traveler. Screening Virginia addresses a secondary high-risk source beyond the obvious Mississippi hotspot, enhancing regional defense through a complementary approach rather than competing for the highest-risk source. This strategy optimizes detection utility and minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas over the next 14 days."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious risk from the origin states, Mississippi presents the highest infectious density among the candidates with (E+I)/Population approximately 0.00295, significantly higher than Arizona (0.00045), New Mexico (0.00028), and Texas (0.00010). Despite its smaller population, Mississippi's exposed and infected counts are relatively large, posing a substantial importation risk. The average daily inbound flow from Mississippi to Virginia is moderate at 3303 travelers, which means the number of hidden infections entering Virginia from Mississippi is non-negligible. Implementing a 90percent screening and detection mandate for inbound travelers from Mississippi can effectively convert the majority of exposed and infected individuals into confirmed cases upon arrival, thereby reducing hidden community transmission. Arizona and Texas, while having higher overall inflows, have lower infectious densities, making their relative risk per traveler lower. New Mexico has both low inflow and low infectious density, making it a less critical target. Targeting Mississippi fills an important gap in regional defense by addressing a secondary high-risk source that might be overlooked compared to larger states like Texas or Arizona, thus complementing broader epidemic control efforts. This focused intervention is expected to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia over the next 14 days by limiting the importation of hidden infections from the highest risk origin state."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Mississippi presents the highest infectious density among origin states evaluated, with (E+I)/Population approximately 0.0051, significantly exceeding others: New Mexico (~0.00025), Texas (~0.00014), and Virginia (~0.00094). Despite moderate inbound flow into Arizona (1596 daily), Mississippi's elevated hidden infectious population (E+I = 13814) implies a higher absolute number of infectious travelers entering Arizona. Implementing targeted inbound screening on Mississippi travelers will detect and convert 90percent of these hidden cases (E and I) into confirmed cases (Q) upon arrival, substantially reducing the risk of undetected community seeding. In contrast, Texas and Virginia have larger inflows but lower infectious densities, and New Mexico, though having high inflow (23793), has very low infectious prevalence. Prioritizing Mississippi balances risk and resource allocation by focusing on a high-risk state that might be under-monitored by others, thus filling a regional defense gap rather than competing redundantly on more obvious but lower-risk sources. This strategy optimally minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona over the next 14 days by significantly cutting the importation of hidden infections from the highest-risk origin state."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state shows Virginia as having the highest risk profile with approximately 8071 infected/exposed individuals over a population of 8,530,655, yielding an infectious density near 0.00095, which is notably higher than Arizona (~0.00008), New Mexico (~0.00025), and Texas (~0.00014). Despite Texas having a large absolute number of infections, its huge population dilutes infectious density. Virginia sends an average daily inflow of 3671 travelers to Mississippi, presenting a significant channel for potential importation of hidden infections. By implementing a 90percent rigorous screening at the Virginia inbound flow, we can effectively identify and quarantine the majority of exposed and infected individuals arriving from this relatively high-risk source, thus reducing covert disease spread within Mississippi. Targeting Virginia fills a crucial gap in regional defense, as other states like Texas have higher absolute flows but lower infectious density. Arizona and New Mexico, though smaller in infectious density, have similar or slightly lower flows but less risk. This focused intervention balances detection utility and resource allocation, minimizing overall case and death importation. Hence, selecting Virginia for targeted inbound screening optimizes epidemic control in Mississippi over the next 14 days.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits a notably high infectious density with (E+I) totaling 13814 over a population of approximately 9,751,534, yielding an infectious density of about 0.00142. This high density combined with a daily inbound flow of 1,241 travelers into New Mexico presents a significant risk of importing hidden infections. Screening travelers from Mississippi with a 90percent detection rate of exposed and infected individuals would effectively convert a substantial portion of these hidden cases into confirmed cases upon arrival, thereby reducing the seeding of new infections in New Mexico. Although Texas has a much larger inbound flow (84,392) and considerable infected individuals, its lower infectious density (~0.00014) and higher population dilute its relative risk. Arizona and Virginia have moderate infectious densities but greatly differ in inbound flows and total population, making their risk profiles less critical. Targeting Mississippi is a strategic choice to fill a gap in regional defense by focusing on a high-risk source with manageable traveler volume, balancing detection utility and operational feasibility. This approach complements broader regional controls likely targeting larger states, thus minimizing New Mexico¨s cumulative confirmed cases and deaths effectively over the next 14 days.'

2025-12-24 19:41:05,104 - od_agent - INFO - Region texas policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Evaluating the infectious density, Mississippi has the highest combined fraction of Exposed (E=9375) and Infected (I=4439) relative to its total population (~27.4 million), significantly exceeding other states. This indicates a notably higher risk of importing hidden infections into Texas. The daily inbound flow from Mississippi into Texas is substantial at 30,835 travelers, meaning a sizable volume of potentially infectious individuals could enter. Implementing targeted inbound screening on Mississippi travelers can rigorously identify and quarantine 90percent of these hidden cases, drastically reducing Texas¨s infection importation and subsequent local transmission. Arizona, despite a high inflow (41,317), has a much lower infectious density, and New Mexico, though having the highest inflow (136,934), has low infectious prevalence, thus lower risk per traveler. Virginia shows moderate risk but lower flow (19,791) than Mississippi. Choosing Mississippi balances impact by focusing on a high-risk, moderate flow source, filling a critical gap in regional defense rather than competing for obvious high-volume but lower-risk origins like New Mexico. This targeted policy minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas effectively over the next 14 days.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density, defined as (E+I)/Population, for each origin state reveals that Mississippi poses the highest risk to Virginia. Mississippi's exposed plus infected individuals total 13,814, with a population of approximately 2,737,715, resulting in an infectious density of roughly 0.00504. This is significantly higher than Arizona (E+I=5999/7,722,702=0.00078), New Mexico (857/3,426,632=0.00025), and Texas (3,935/27,330,147=0.000144). Additionally, Mississippi's average daily inbound flow into Virginia is 3,307, which is substantial enough to warrant concern but not the largest. Implementing a 90percent screening and detection mandate on travelers from Mississippi would convert approximately 90percent of the hidden infections (E and I) entering Virginia from this source into confirmed cases (Q), effectively reducing the risk of undetected infectious individuals entering the community. Choosing Mississippi targets a critical high-risk origin that might be overlooked if only the largest flow states were considered, thereby complementing regional defense rather than competing for the obvious high-volume sources like Texas or Arizona. This targeted intervention is expected to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two-week horizon by sharply reducing imported hidden infections from the highest infectious density state among the options."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals that Mississippi, with approximately 21,042 infectious individuals (E=14254, I=6788) out of a population of 6,282,009, has an infectious density around 0.00335, which is higher than Texas (~0.00018), Virginia (~0.00117), and New Mexico (~0.00024). Arizona's inbound flow from Mississippi is moderate at 1,899 daily travelers, but given the relatively high infectious density, the potential number of hidden infections entering Arizona from Mississippi is significant. Implementing a 90percent screening of inbound travelers from Mississippi would effectively convert the majority of exposed and infected individuals into confirmed cases on arrival, thereby reducing the risk of hidden infectious individuals seeding new cases in Arizona. While Texas contributes the largest volume of inbound travelers (42,323 daily), its infectious density is substantially lower, making the marginal benefit of screening there less impactful per traveler. Virginia and New Mexico have higher inbound flows than Mississippi except New Mexico's flow is higher, but their infectious densities are lower than Mississippi's. Choosing Mississippi as the targeted origin state addresses a higher-risk, less obvious vector of disease importation and complements possible overlapping policies by other states or agencies focusing on higher volume states like Texas. This targeted approach balances risk reduction with resource allocation efficiency, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona during the next 14-day horizon."

 policy={'texas': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals that Texas has a moderate infectious density compared to others: Texas (E=1852 + I=2940 = 4792) over a population roughly estimated by summing compartments is about 26.4 million, yielding an infectious density around 0.018percent. Arizona and Virginia have higher absolute exposed and infected counts but also vastly larger populations, resulting in lower densities approximately 0.09percent and 0.012percent respectively, while New Mexico is much lower in both counts and density. Texas also contributes the highest average daily inbound flow into Mississippi at 47,996 travelers, significantly greater than the others (Arizona 2,480, New Mexico 2,180, Virginia 4,364). This combination of a non-negligible infectious density and the largest inbound flow implies a higher absolute number of potentially infected individuals entering Mississippi from Texas. Implementing a targeted 90percent rigorous screening on inbound travelers from Texas would convert the majority of exposed and infected arrivals into confirmed cases, effectively removing hidden infections from community circulation in Mississippi. Choosing Texas addresses a major importation source, filling a critical gap in regional defense given its volume and risk profile, while other states with higher infectious densities have considerably lower travel volumes, making their contribution to importation risk less significant. This focused intervention balances risk reduction and resource allocation by targeting the most impactful origin state for inbound screening, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next two weeks.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='The decision to target Mississippi for the 14-day inbound screening policy is based on a detailed risk assessment of infectious density and inbound flow. Mississippi exhibits a notably high infectious density with (E+I) = 21042 over a population of approximately 25.7 million, resulting in an infectious density around 0.000818, which is substantially higher than other origin states. Although the inbound flow from Mississippi to New Mexico is relatively low (~1324 daily), the concentration of hidden infections (E and I) among arriving travelers remains significant. By implementing a 90percent screening and conversion of these hidden infections into the confirmed compartment upon arrival, we expect to markedly reduce the importation of undetected infectious individuals, thereby minimizing community transmission. Arizona and Texas, while having higher inbound flows, show lower infectious densities, and Virginia has a moderate infectious density but with low inbound flow. Targeting Mississippi fills a strategic gap in regional defense, addressing a high-risk secondary source rather than competing to screen the obvious larger flow states with lower infection prevalence. This targeted approach balances the systemic risk and resource allocation to optimize epidemic control in New Mexico, aiming to reduce cumulative confirmed cases and deaths effectively.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals that Mississippi poses the highest risk. Mississippi's infectious density is approximately (14254+6788)/(2569624+...), roughly 0.0080, significantly higher than Arizona (~0.00095), New Mexico (~0.00024), and Virginia (~0.0012). Mississippi also has a substantial inbound flow into Texas of 37,780 daily travelers, providing a meaningful pathway for disease importation. Implementing a 90percent screening on travelers from Mississippi would convert a large portion of exposed and infected individuals into confirmed cases upon arrival, effectively curbing hidden infections entering Texas and reducing community spread. Arizona and Virginia, while having large populations and inbound flows, have lower infectious densities, and New Mexico, despite the highest inbound flow (158,164), has a much lower infectious density, making it a lower-risk source. Targeting Mississippi is a strategic choice to fill a gap in regional defense, as other states might focus on more obvious high-volume or large-population states, leaving this high-risk but moderate-flow state unchecked. This policy balances the reduction of importation risk with operational feasibility, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals critical insights for targeted inbound screening. Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density with (E+I) = 14254 + 6788 = 21042 over a population of approximately 25,696,624, yielding an infectious density of about 0.000819, significantly higher than Arizona (~0.000100), New Mexico (~0.000242), and Texas (~0.000183). Despite Mississippi's lower inbound flow into Virginia (4177 travelers daily) compared to Texas (21124) and Arizona (4525), the high infectious density implies a higher proportion of hidden infections entering Virginia from Mississippi. Implementing a 90percent screening and detection policy on incoming travelers from Mississippi would convert a large fraction of exposed and infected individuals into confirmed cases, substantially reducing the risk of undetected infectious importation. While Texas has the highest absolute inbound flow, its lower infectious density reduces the marginal benefit of screening compared to Mississippi. Arizona and New Mexico show both lower infectious densities and inbound flows, making them less critical targets. Selecting Mississippi as the single targeted origin state balances risk and resource allocation by addressing a high-infectious-density source that might be less obvious but poses a substantial importation threat. This approach complements potential measures by other states focusing on large-volume but lower-risk origins, thus enhancing regional epidemic control through strategic coordination rather than competing for the same high-volume states."

2025-12-24 19:41:44,554 - od_agent - INFO - Region arizona policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, Mississippi exhibits the highest risk among the origin states with a combined exposed and infected count of 30,511 over a population of approximately 6,519,208, resulting in an infectious density of about 0.00468. In comparison, Virginia's infectious density is roughly 0.00162, Texas about 0.00020, and New Mexico a very low 0.00025. Mississippi's infectious density is nearly three times that of Virginia and significantly higher than Texas and New Mexico. Furthermore, Mississippi's average daily inbound flow into Arizona is 2,382, which, while lower than Texas and New Mexico, still represents a substantial source of potential disease importation. Enforcing a 90percent rigorous screening on travelers from Mississippi can effectively capture a large fraction of hidden infections (E and I), reducing their introduction into Arizona's community and thus curbing secondary transmission. By targeting Mississippi, the policy fills a critical gap in regional defense, as other states might already be focusing on higher-volume but lower-risk flows such as from Texas or New Mexico. This targeted approach balances detection utility and resource allocation, aiming to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Arizona over the next two weeks. Therefore, selecting Mississippi for inbound screening optimally mitigates systemic risks from the highest infectious density origin state with manageable flow volumes."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density calculated as (E+I)/Population, approximately (10332+2412)/8649698 「 0.00152, which is higher than Arizona (~0.00128), Texas (~0.00021), and New Mexico (~0.00025). Although Texas has the largest inbound flow to Mississippi (52561 daily), its infectious density is much lower, reducing its relative importation risk per traveler. Virginia's moderate inbound flow (4702 daily) coupled with the highest infectious density implies a significant risk of importing hidden infections. Implementing a 90percent screening at the Virginia-Mississippi border will effectively identify and quarantine a large portion of exposed and infected travelers, significantly reducing hidden infectious importation. Targeting Virginia is a strategic choice to address a high-risk source that may be less obviously targeted by other states who might focus on Texas due to volume. This policy balances reducing imported infections from a moderate-volume but high-risk source, complementing broader regional efforts and improving Mississippi's epidemic control without overly disrupting large-scale flows from Texas or Arizona. Hence, screening Virginia inbound travelers maximizes detection utility and mitigates regional epidemic risk effectively over the next 14 days."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Considering the source risk profiles, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density among all origin states, calculated as (E+I)/Population = (20670+9841)/6511171 「 0.00467, which is significantly higher than Arizona (~0.0013), Texas (~0.00021), and Virginia (~0.00157). Despite Mississippi's relatively low average daily inbound flow into New Mexico (1425), the high infectious density means that each inbound traveler from Mississippi carries a disproportionately higher risk of being exposed or infected. Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy on travelers from Mississippi will capture approximately 90percent of these hidden infections (E and I), substantially reducing the importation of infectious individuals and thereby curbing potential community spread. While Texas contributes the largest absolute number of inbound travelers (115,020/day) to New Mexico, its much lower infectious density diminishes the relative benefit of screening there compared to Mississippi. Arizona and Virginia have moderate infectious densities and flows but are outperformed by Mississippi in risk concentration. By targeting Mississippi, we address a high-risk but potentially overlooked source state, filling a gap in regional defense where other agents might prioritize larger states like Texas or Arizona. This focused approach balances detection utility with practical enforcement capacity, achieving maximal disease importation reduction per screened traveler and optimizing resource allocation for inbound screening over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for origin states reveals mississippi as the highest risk source: with E=20670 and I=9841 over a population approximately equal to S+E+I+Q+R+D ~ 2389826+20670+9841+5476+15149+655 「 2.43 million, the infectious density approaches roughly 1.2percent, significantly higher than arizona (~0.13percent), new mexico (~0.02percent), and virginia (~0.16percent). Mississippi also has a substantial average daily inbound flow into texas (39,776), which means a high volume of potentially infectious travelers. Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy on mississippi travelers will effectively identify and quarantine approximately 90percent of exposed and infected individuals arriving from that state, drastically reducing hidden infectious cases entering texas. Arizona, despite a large population and flow, shows a low infectious density, and new mexico and virginia have both lower infectious densities and smaller inbound flows relative to mississippi. Targeting mississippi addresses a critical gap in regional defense by focusing on a high-risk state with substantial mobility links, rather than the obvious large but lower risk states like arizona or new mexico. This strategic selection balances detection utility and systemic risk reduction, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in texas over the next two weeks.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi presents the highest infectious density when calculated as (E+I)/Population, with E=20670 and I=9841 over a population of approximately 23,899,426, yielding an infectious density significantly higher than Arizona, New Mexico, or Texas. Despite Mississippi's lower average daily inbound flow into Virginia (4198) compared to Texas (25244) and Arizona (5493), its very high infectious density means that the proportion of hidden infections entering Virginia from Mississippi is substantial. Implementing targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi means rigorously screening and converting 90percent of exposed and infected inbound individuals to confirmed (Q), effectively reducing the hidden infectious population entering Virginia and mitigating new local transmission chains. Arizona and Texas have larger inbound flows but lower infectious density, and New Mexico has both low infectious density and low inbound flow, making Mississippi the optimal single target. This choice focuses on a significant high-risk source that might be overlooked if only high-volume states are considered, providing a complementary layer of defense and reducing systemic risks from a secondary but highly infectious source. Therefore, targeting Mississippi balances infectious risk and traffic volume, maximizing screening utility to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the four origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population = (27885+13292)/6521022 「 0.0063, which is significantly higher than New Mexico (~0.00026), Texas (~0.00022), and Virginia (~0.0021). This indicates Mississippi poses the greatest risk of importing hidden infections into Arizona. The inbound flow from Mississippi to Arizona is moderate at 2601 daily travelers, meaning a meaningful number of exposed and infected individuals potentially enter Arizona daily. By implementing a 90percent screening and detection mandate on travelers from Mississippi, we can identify and convert a large portion of these hidden infections (E and I) directly into the confirmed (Q) compartment, effectively reducing the silent spread within Arizona. While Texas has the largest inbound flow, its infectious density is much lower, diluting the risk per traveler. Targeting Mississippi addresses a high-risk source that might be under-prioritized by other states or regions focusing on Texas or Virginia, filling a critical gap in regional defense. This targeted intervention balances impact and feasibility, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona over the next two weeks by sharply reducing the importation of hidden infections from the riskiest origin state.'

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Virginia has the highest infectious density calculated as (E+I)/Population. Virginia's infectious density is approximately (12981+3030)/8647012 = 0.00186, which is significantly higher than Arizona (~0.00153), New Mexico (~0.00027), and Texas (~0.00022). Although Texas has the largest absolute number of infected individuals, its infectious density is comparatively low due to its large population. Virginia also contributes a moderate inbound flow of 5376 daily travelers into Mississippi. By imposing a targeted inbound screening on travelers from Virginia, 90percent of exposed and infected individuals entering Mississippi can be identified and moved to confirmed (Q) status, effectively reducing hidden infections arriving from this source. This intervention targets a secondary but significant regional risk source, complementing likely efforts from other states that may target larger states like Texas or Arizona. Focusing on Virginia fills a critical gap in regional defense, helping to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next 14 days. The balance of infection prevalence and inbound flow suggests Virginia is the optimal state to restrict for maximum epidemic control benefit."

2025-12-24 19:42:23,755 - od_agent - INFO - Region new mexico policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi is based on a detailed risk and utility analysis. Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density among the origin states, with (E+I)/Population approximately 0.0199 (27885+13292)/2118693, significantly higher than Arizona (~0.0016), Texas (~0.00022), and Virginia (~0.0021). This high infectious density indicates a substantial hidden infectious population potentially entering New Mexico. Although Mississippi's average daily inbound flow to New Mexico is relatively low (1605), the high infection prevalence means that even a small number of travelers could disproportionately contribute to new infections. Implementing a 90percent screening and detection protocol on inbound travelers from Mississippi would effectively convert most exposed and infected individuals into confirmed cases upon arrival, reducing hidden transmission chains. This intervention targets a secondary but high-risk source, complementing and filling gaps in regional defenses that may focus on larger origin states but with lower infection densities. Arizona and Texas have much higher inbound flows but lower infectious densities, making screening less efficient in detection per traveler. Virginia's risk is moderate but still lower than Mississippi. Therefore, focusing resources on Mississippi provides a strategic balance between infection risk and detection utility to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks."

2025-12-24 19:42:30,844 - od_agent - INFO - Region texas policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density, defined as (E+I)/Population, mississippi exhibits the highest risk among the origin states with (27885+13292)/2118693 「 0.0197, significantly surpassing arizona (~0.00156), new mexico (~0.00027), and virginia (~0.0023). Despite mississippi's smaller population, its infectious density is nearly an order of magnitude higher than others, signaling a concentrated risk. The inbound flow from mississippi to texas is moderate at 37844 daily travelers, which means a substantial number of potentially exposed or infected individuals could be entering texas daily. Implementing a 90percent screening mandate here would effectively identify and isolate the majority of these hidden cases (E and I), sharply reducing the number of infectious individuals entering texas undetected. This targeted approach mitigates the risk from the most infectious source, which might be overlooked if focusing solely on states with higher flows but lower infectious density, such as new mexico. Coordinating screening on mississippi fills a critical regional defense gap, complementing any policies other agents might pursue targeting high population states. Overall, prioritizing mississippi maximizes detection utility and minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in texas over the next two weeks by addressing the highest per capita infectious risk with effective screening."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population = (27885+13292)/~21,18,693 = approximately 0.0199 or 1.99percent, which is substantially higher than Arizona (~0.0016), New Mexico (~0.00027), and Texas (~0.00022). This indicates a significantly higher prevalence of exposed and infected individuals relative to its population size, making it a critical source of potential disease importation risk for Virginia. Despite having a lower daily inbound flow (4459) compared to states like Arizona (6387) and Texas (26942), the high infectious density in Mississippi means that even this smaller flow may introduce a disproportionate number of hidden infections. Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy on travelers from Mississippi will capture approximately 90percent of these hidden infections (E and I), converting them to confirmed cases (Q) and thus reducing silent community spread in Virginia. This targeted approach fills a gap in regional defense since other states like Texas and Arizona, despite larger flows, have much lower infectious density, and New Mexico's infectious density is negligible. Prioritizing Mississippi balances detection utility and risk profile effectively, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia over the two-week horizon."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals that Mississippi poses the highest risk. Mississippi has (33715+16109)/6371393 「 0.0078 infectious density, notably higher than New Mexico (~0.0003), Texas (~0.00023), and Virginia (~0.0023). Additionally, Mississippi's average daily inbound flow into Arizona is 2337 travelers, which is moderate but significant enough to impact Arizona's epidemic trajectory. Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy on travelers from Mississippi would rigorously identify and quarantine 90percent of exposed and infected individuals entering Arizona, substantially reducing hidden infection importation. This detection utility is crucial because Mississippi's high infectious density combined with nontrivial travel volume presents a disproportionate importation risk. Although Texas has a much larger flow (49331) into Arizona, its infectious density is much lower, diminishing the relative benefit of screening there. New Mexico and Virginia, while having moderate flows, have lower infectious densities compared to Mississippi. Targeting Mississippi addresses a high-risk yet potentially under-monitored origin, supplementing regional defenses that may otherwise focus on larger states like Texas. This approach balances impact and feasibility, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona over the next two weeks by focusing on the most consequential single source of imported infection."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Assessing the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals that virginia has the highest infectious density among the candidates. Virginia's E+I sum is 20104 over a population sum of approximately 8,642,357, yielding an infectious density of about 0.00233. Arizona follows with a lower infectious density (~0.00195), Texas has a much lower density (~0.00023), and New Mexico is the lowest (~0.0003). Although Texas has the largest inbound flow into Mississippi (63,448 daily), its infectious density is low, so the absolute number of infected travelers is moderate. Virginia has a smaller inbound flow (6,108 daily) but a higher infectious density, resulting in a significant number of infected individuals entering Mississippi. Screening at the border with a 90percent detection rate of exposed and infected travelers from virginia will effectively reduce a substantial number of hidden infections entering Mississippi daily, thus lowering the risk of new chains of transmission. Targeting virginia addresses a notable secondary source of infection risk that might be overlooked if only large-volume states are screened, ensuring a layered defense in regional epidemic control. Arizona's large inbound flow but lower infectious density and Texas's low infectious density make them less optimal for screening given resource constraints. New Mexico's low infectious density and flow make it the least impactful target. Hence, the recommended policy is to implement targeted inbound screening for travelers arriving from virginia for the next 14 days."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals distinct risk profiles: Arizona has an infectious density of approximately 0.0019, Texas around 0.00024, Virginia about 0.0024, and Mississippi a notably high 0.0320, indicating a significantly greater proportion of hidden infections in Mississippi. Considering average daily inbound flows into New Mexico, Mississippi contributes a low volume (~1565/day) compared to Texas (~132,369/day) and Arizona (~41,834/day), but its extremely high infectious density translates into a disproportionately high importation risk per traveler. Implementing targeted inbound screening on Mississippi travelers would detect and quarantine roughly 90percent of infected or exposed individuals entering from that state, effectively reducing hidden importations from the highest risk source. While Texas and Arizona have higher absolute flows, their lower infectious densities result in fewer hidden infections intercepted per traveler screened. Targeting Mississippi fills a critical gap in regional defense by addressing a smaller but highly infectious source, complementing potential broader efforts by neighboring states focusing on larger volume but lower risk sources. This targeted approach balances detection utility with resource allocation and minimizes overall cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico for the upcoming two-week horizon.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The key rationale for targeting Mississippi for inbound screening into Texas is based on its notably high infectious density and significant hidden infection risk. Infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, is highest for Mississippi among the origins: (33715+16109)/1739439 「 0.0286, which is substantially greater than Arizona (~0.002), New Mexico (~0.0003), and Virginia (~0.0023). This elevated infectious density indicates a higher proportion of exposed and infected individuals relative to total population, raising the likelihood of disease importation. Mississippi's average daily inbound flow to Texas is 36298, moderate but sufficient to pose systemic risk. By enforcing a 90percent screening detection mandate on travelers from Mississippi, a large portion of hidden infections (E and I) can be identified and quarantined upon arrival, effectively removing these cases from community transmission chains. This intervention can significantly reduce secondary spread fueled by undetected imported cases. Although Arizona and Virginia have higher absolute inbound volumes, their infectious densities are far lower, reducing the marginal benefit of screening. New Mexico¨s infectious density and flow are also low, making it a less critical source. Targeting Mississippi fills a regional gap in defense, as other agents might prioritize obvious high-volume states like Arizona or Virginia, while Mississippi¨s high infection prevalence and moderate flow represent a critical but under-addressed importation risk. Thus, screening incoming travelers from Mississippi optimally balances infection importation risk and resource use to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Texas over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Mississippi presents the highest infectious density among origin states with (E+I) = 49824 over a population of approximately 7.4 million, resulting in an infectious density of about 0.0067, significantly higher than other states like Arizona (0.002), New Mexico (0.0003), and Texas (0.00023). Despite Mississippi's lower inbound flow into Virginia (4848 daily) compared to Texas (28822) and Arizona (6789), the combination of its high infectious density and non-negligible flow implies a substantial importation risk. Screening travelers from Mississippi would capture and convert roughly 90percent of hidden infections (E+I) entering Virginia, effectively reducing the number of undetected infectious individuals arriving. Targeting Mississippi thus fills a critical gap in controlling a less obvious yet highly infectious source, complementing potential measures by neighboring states or other agents focusing on more obvious high-volume origins. This targeted inbound screening aligns with minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia by concentrating resources on the highest threat per traveler, rather than just volume, optimizing the benefit of the screening mandate over the 14-day horizon."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Evaluating the infection risk from origin states to Arizona, Mississippi presents the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population = (37299+17909)/6369349 「 0.0086, which is significantly higher than New Mexico (~0.00033), Texas (~0.00025), and Virginia (~0.0032). The daily inbound flow from Mississippi to Arizona is moderate at 2348 travelers. Applying a 90percent screening on this flow could convert approximately 0.9 * 2348 * 0.0086 「 18 hidden infections (E and I) daily into confirmed cases upon arrival, effectively reducing the import of unseen infections. Although Texas has a much higher daily inflow (46103), its infectious density is substantially lower, resulting in fewer hidden infections intercepted per traveler. New Mexico¨s flow is high but infectious density is minimal, and Virginia, while having a moderate infectious density, has a lower flow. Targeting Mississippi addresses a notable source of risk that may be overlooked by other states focusing on larger flows from Texas or New Mexico, thus filling a regional defense gap. This targeted screening will reduce Arizona¨s cumulative confirmed cases and deaths over the 14-day horizon by intercepting a disproportionate number of hidden infections relative to traveler volume, optimizing resource allocation for epidemic control.'

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state relative to Mississippi's risk, Virginia presents the highest infectious density among the candidates with (20396+4762)/~8.6M 「 0.0030, compared to Arizona (~0.0024), Texas (~0.00025), and New Mexico (~0.00033). Despite Texas having the highest absolute number of infected individuals, its infectious density is lower due to its large population. Virginia's inbound flow into Mississippi is moderate (5270 daily), which offers a manageable target for screening efforts. Screening 90percent of inbound travelers from Virginia will effectively convert a significant portion of exposed and infected individuals into confirmed cases (Q) upon arrival, substantially reducing hidden infections entering Mississippi. This targeted intervention focuses on a high-risk but less obvious source compared to Texas, which might already be under scrutiny by other states or agencies due to its volume. By selecting Virginia, we fill a gap in regional defense, preventing an overlooked but consequential importation risk. This approach balances maximal reduction of imported infections with operational feasibility and systemic risk minimization, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next 14 days."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Mississippi presents the highest infectious density among the origin states, with combined exposed and infected individuals totaling 55,208 out of a population of approximately 6,366,000, yielding an infectious density of about 0.00867. This is significantly higher than Arizona (0.00245), Texas (0.00025), and Virginia (0.00322). Despite Mississippi's relatively low daily inflow to New Mexico (1,638), the elevated infectious density means that each traveler from Mississippi has a substantially higher risk of being exposed or infected. Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy focused on Mississippi will effectively identify and isolate a large portion of these hidden infections (about 90percent detection of E and I), thus preventing the importation of numerous hidden cases that could propagate local transmission. Although Texas has the highest inflow volume, its infectious density is much lower, reducing the marginal benefit of screening there. Arizona and Virginia have moderate infectious densities but with either large inflows or intermediate risk. Targeting Mississippi fills a critical gap in regional defense by mitigating risk from a high-prevalence but lower-volume source often overlooked in favor of larger states. This approach balances the need for impactful intervention with resource allocation efficiency, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals critical insights. Mississippi, despite its smaller population (~1.37 million), exhibits a very high exposed count (E=37299) and infected (I=17909), yielding an infectious density approximately 0.039 or 3.9percent. This is substantially higher than other states: Arizona (~0.0025), New Mexico (~0.00033), and Virginia (~0.0033). The inbound flow from Mississippi to Texas averages 33,936 daily, which is moderate but significant enough to impact Texas' epidemic dynamics. By implementing a targeted inbound screening policy on travelers from Mississippi, we can detect and quarantine roughly 90percent of hidden infections (E and I) among these travelers, thereby sharply reducing imported infectious pressure. This intervention is crucial because Mississippi is a high-risk secondary source with a disproportionately high infectious density, which might be overlooked if the focus was only on states with larger absolute flows but lower infectious densities like New Mexico. Targeting Mississippi fills a gap in regional defense and complements broader epidemic control efforts, potentially preventing a surge in Texas' confirmed cases and deaths. Arizona and Virginia have lower infectious densities or similar levels but their inbound flows or infectious proportions are less critical compared to Mississippi. New Mexico, although sending the highest flow, has very low infectious density, thus less priority for screening. Therefore, restricting Mississippi inbound travelers with rigorous screening maximizes detection utility and optimally reduces Texas' systemic risk."

2025-12-24 19:43:31,847 - od_agent - INFO - Region virginia policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi presents the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population approximately 0.039 (55208 infected out of ~1.37 million), markedly higher than Arizona (~0.0025), New Mexico (~0.00033), and Texas (~0.00025). Despite having a smaller inbound flow to Virginia (4413 daily) compared to Arizona (6475) and Texas (29507), Mississippi's extremely high hidden infectious population (E+I) means that even limited flows could introduce significant risk. Implementing targeted inbound screening on Mississippi travelers would capture about 90percent of the estimated 55,208 hidden infections daily entering Virginia from Mississippi, significantly reducing undetected importation. Arizona and Texas, although having higher absolute inflows, have much lower infectious densities, implying lower per capita risk. New Mexico's low infection rates and inflow render screening less impactful. By focusing on Mississippi, this policy fills a regional defense gap by targeting a high-risk but less obvious source, complementing potential broader measures by others who may target more populous states. This strategic choice optimizes resource allocation and minimizes cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia over the 14-day horizon by cutting off a disproportionate portion of hidden infectious imports from a critical high-risk origin."

2025-12-24 19:43:36,138 - od_agent - INFO - Region arizona policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density among origin states, with (E+I)/Population approximately 0.0519 (57,301 infectious out of ~1.1 million), far exceeding other states. Despite a moderate daily inflow to Arizona (~1984), the absolute number of potentially infected travelers is substantial. Implementing targeted inbound screening here will identify and quarantine 90percent of exposed and infected arrivals, effectively reducing hidden infectious importation by over 50,000 individuals in two weeks, significantly mitigating community transmission risk. Texas has a large inflow (~44,848) but a much lower infectious density (~0.00027), so screening there yields less marginal benefit per traveler. New Mexico and Virginia have intermediate densities but either lower infectious counts or lower inflows. Targeting Mississippi addresses this high-risk source that may be underprioritized by others focusing on high volume but lower prevalence states, thus filling a gap in regional epidemic control. This focused screening balances risk reduction and resource allocation, minimizing Arizona's cumulative cases and deaths by curbing a disproportionately infectious import route over the next 14 days."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, we evaluate infectious density as (E+I)/Population using the given averages. Arizona's infectious density is approximately (25108+1599)/~8,944,944 「 0.00306, New Mexico's is (1728+370)/~5,530,193 「 0.00038, Texas's is (2563+4160)/~24,983,169 「 0.00027, and Virginia's is (25451+5945)/~8,512,977 「 0.00376. Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density, indicating a higher proportion of hidden infectious individuals potentially entering Mississippi. Considering inbound flow, Virginia contributes a moderate daily inflow of 4,887 travelers, which is smaller than Texas (51,070) but non-negligible. Implementing targeted inbound screening with 90percent detection on arrivals from Virginia will effectively identify and quarantine a significant fraction of exposed and infected travelers, reducing the hidden infectious importation risk. While Texas has a large volume of travelers, its lower infectious density reduces the marginal benefit of screening. Arizona also has a high infectious density but a higher inflow to Mississippi (2,079) than Virginia, yet Virginia's combination of high infectious density and moderate inflow makes it the optimal target to maximize detection utility. This strategy complements other states' efforts by focusing on a high-risk source that might be overlooked due to moderate flow size, thus filling a regional defense gap instead of competing with obvious high-volume origins. Therefore, we recommend enforcing the rigorous 90percent screening mandate on inbound travelers from Virginia for the next 14 days to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Mississippi."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, with E=38590 and I=18711 over a population of approximately 7,060,762 (sum of S, E, I, Q, R, D), yielding a notably elevated hidden infection prevalence compared to others. Although its daily inbound flow to New Mexico is relatively low (1219), the high infection burden means that even this smaller flow poses significant importation risk. Implementing targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi will capture approximately 90percent of these hidden infections (E and I), effectively converting them to confirmed cases (Q) and thus removing a substantial fraction of potential new community transmissions. In contrast, Arizona and Virginia have higher inflows but comparatively lower infectious densities, while Texas has moderate density but the highest inbound flow. Choosing Mississippi targets a high-risk yet less obvious source, filling a critical gap in regional defense by preventing importation from a secondary but highly infectious origin, rather than solely focusing on the largest flows. This strategic choice balances detection utility and systemic risk, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next 14 days without overextending screening resources.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, indicating a substantial proportion of exposed and infected individuals relative to its population size. Specifically, Mississippi has 38590 exposed and 18711 infected individuals out of a population approximately equal to the sum of all compartments, which yields a notably higher infectious density compared to Arizona, New Mexico, and Virginia. Considering the inbound flow to Texas, Mississippi contributes a moderate volume of travelers (31542 daily inflow), which while not the highest, is significant enough to pose importation risk. Implementing targeted inbound screening on Mississippi travelers can effectively detect and convert approximately 90percent of hidden infections (E and I) into confirmed cases (Q) upon arrival, substantially reducing the risk of undetected disease introduction. This focused intervention on Mississippi addresses a high-risk source that might be overlooked if only the largest inflow states with lower infection density were screened, thereby complementing regional defense strategies and avoiding redundant efforts on obvious high-volume but lower-risk states like New Mexico or Arizona. Thus, the policy balances detection utility against epidemiological risk and travel volume, optimizing disease control outcomes in Texas for the next two weeks.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density defined as (E+I)/Population. With E=38590 and I=18711 out of a population approximately equal to S+E+I+Q+R+D = 1091397 + 38590 + 18711 + 12963 + 63943 + 2174 「 1,246,778, the infectious density is roughly 4.6percent, significantly higher than other states. Mississippi's inbound flow to Virginia is moderate at 3,879 travelers daily. By targeting Mississippi for a 90percent rigorous screening converting exposed (E) and infected (I) travelers into confirmed (Q), we can capture a substantial number of hidden infections entering Virginia. Estimating hidden infections entering Virginia daily from Mississippi as (E+I)/Population * inflow 「 572 hidden cases per day, 90percent detection would quarantine approximately 515 individuals daily, greatly reducing the importation risk. Other states like Arizona and Texas have larger inflows but lower infectious density, while New Mexico has very low infectious density and inflow. Choosing Mississippi reflects a strategic focus on a high-risk, moderate inflow source, addressing a significant potential importation vector possibly overlooked by other agents who might focus on larger states like Texas or Arizona. This targeted approach balances detection utility and resource allocation, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia over the next 14 days."

2025-12-24 19:44:08,842 - od_agent - INFO - Region arizona policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Mississippi exhibits an extremely high infectious density with a combined exposed and infected population of 52,700 out of roughly 6.46 million total (sum of S+E+I+Q+R+D), yielding an infectious density significantly higher than other origin states. This means a greater proportion of incoming travelers from Mississippi are likely to be in the hidden infectious categories E and I. With an average daily inflow of 1,831 travelers from Mississippi into Arizona, the absolute number of potentially infectious individuals entering is substantial. Implementing targeted inbound screening here would allow us to identify and quarantine approximately 90percent of these hidden cases, effectively reducing importation-driven seeding of new infections within Arizona. Other states like Texas and Virginia have larger inflows but much lower infectious densities, making the expected number of infectious arrivals relatively lower despite volume. New Mexico, while having a large inflow, shows very low infectious prevalence, thus posing less risk. Targeting Mississippi fills a critical gap in regional defense by focusing on a less obvious but highly risky source, rather than competing with others likely to impose screening on Texas or Virginia. This focused intervention will minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona over the next two weeks by intercepting a disproportionate share of imported infections with relatively manageable resource allocation.'

2025-12-24 19:44:14,333 - od_agent - INFO - Region mississippi policy response:
 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the four origin states, Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population approximately 0.0047, calculated from E=31560 and I=7379 against a population sum of roughly 11,000,000. This density surpasses Arizona, Texas, and New Mexico significantly, indicating a higher hidden infectious risk per inbound traveler. The average daily inbound flow from Virginia to Mississippi is moderate at 5593 travelers, providing a manageable volume for screening resources. Implementing targeted inbound screening for Virginia can capture about 90percent of the exposed and infected individuals arriving, substantially reducing the hidden infectious importation. In contrast, Texas has a lower infectious density but a very high inbound flow, making strict screening more resource-intensive, while Arizona and New Mexico have both lower infectious densities and flows. Prioritizing Virginia balances impact and feasibility, addressing a significant risk source that might be under-targeted by neighboring states focusing on higher volume but lower density origins. This strategic targeting complements regional defense efforts and optimizes infection control without overextending screening capacity, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next two weeks.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Analyzing the infectious density (E+I)/Population of each origin state reveals stark contrasts. Mississippi has a notably high infectious density: (35366+17334)/6393211 「 0.0082, which is significantly greater than Arizona (「0.0038), Texas (「0.00029), and Virginia (「0.0048). Despite Mississippi having the lowest average daily inbound flow to New Mexico (1134), its extremely high infectious density means even small inbound flows could disproportionately contribute to hidden infections entering New Mexico. By targeting Mississippi for rigorous 90percent screening, we effectively convert the majority of these hidden infections (E and I compartments) into confirmed cases (Q) upon arrival, greatly reducing undetected community introductions. This targeted approach complements other agents likely focusing on larger inflow states like Texas and Arizona, addressing a critical gap in regional defense by mitigating risk from a secondary but high-risk source. Arizona and Texas, while having much larger inflows, have lower infectious densities and thus lower per capita risk, making Mississippi the optimal choice for maximizing screening utility and minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks.'

2025-12-24 19:44:30,461 - od_agent - INFO - Region texas policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, for each origin state reveals that Mississippi presents the highest risk. Mississippi's exposed and infected population sums to 52699 over a population of approximately 1,027,720 (sum of S, E, I, Q, R, D), resulting in an infectious density of about 5.13percent, significantly higher than Arizona (~0.39percent), New Mexico (~0.04percent), and Virginia (~0.48percent). Despite Mississippi's lower inbound flow into Texas (29,893 daily) relative to New Mexico (145,606) and Arizona (46,652), the high infectious density means a substantial number of hidden infections (E and I) are expected among travelers. By implementing the Targeted Inbound Screening policy on Mississippi travelers, rigorous 90percent screening can convert a majority of these hidden infections into confirmed cases upon arrival, effectively reducing the number of infectious individuals entering Texas undetected. This targeted approach prioritizes a high-risk source with moderate flow rather than the obvious largest inflow states with lower infectious densities, thus filling a critical gap in regional defense and complementing other states' policies. The choice balances detection utility and systemic risk reduction, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals that Mississippi has an exceptionally high infectious density compared to others. Mississippi's combined exposed and infected population (E=35366, I=17334) relative to its population (~838667+35366+17334+13094+80556+2611) indicates a very high hidden infection rate. Despite a modest average daily inbound flow into Virginia (3963), targeting Mississippi offers the highest leverage in intercepting hidden infections entering the state. Screening travelers from Mississippi at ninety percent efficacy would convert a substantial portion of exposed and infected travelers to confirmed cases, reducing undetected spread within Virginia. Arizona and Texas, while having larger absolute inbound flows, have much lower infectious densities and thus lower risk per traveler. New Mexico's infectious density is very low, making screening there less impactful. The policy targets Mississippi as a secondary source filling a gap in regional defense rather than the obvious largest flow states (Arizona, Texas), which may be more likely targeted by other agents, enhancing overall coordination and minimizing systemic risk. This approach balances infection risk and inbound traffic volume to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia over the next 14 days."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E + I)/Population = (28934 + 14295)/6433672 「 0.0067, which is significantly higher than New Mexico (~0.00049), Texas (~0.00031), and Virginia (~0.0056). Mississippi's average daily inbound flow into Arizona is moderate at 1898 travelers, lower than Texas and New Mexico but sufficient for importation risk. Implementing a targeted inbound screening on Mississippi travelers, with rigorous 90percent detection of exposed and infected individuals, would capture approximately 90percent of the estimated hidden infections among the 1898 daily arrivals. This intervention would substantially reduce the importation of hidden infections from a high-risk source, limiting additional seeding in Arizona. Targeting Mississippi addresses a critical vulnerability by focusing on a smaller but highly infectious source, rather than competing with other agents likely to target large inflow states like Texas or New Mexico. This strategic choice complements broader regional defense efforts by mitigating risk from a notable infectious hotspot that might otherwise be overlooked. Overall, the policy balances infection risk with flow volume to optimize case and death reductions in Arizona over the next 14 days."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="To determine the optimal inbound screening target for Mississippi, we first assess the infectious density (E+I)/Population of each origin state. Virginia has a notably high infectious density with (38753+9067)/~8,447,412 「 0.0057, which is significantly higher than Texas (~0.00031), Arizona (~0.0047), and New Mexico (~0.00049). Despite Virginia's smaller daily inbound flow to Mississippi (~4,911) relative to Texas (~42,933) and Arizona (~2,059), the higher infectious density means a greater proportion of inbound travelers could be hidden carriers. Implementing a 90percent screening policy targeting Virginia travelers allows us to capture and quarantine most exposed and infected individuals entering from this state, substantially reducing the risk of importing undetected cases. While Texas has the largest inbound flow, its infectious density is an order of magnitude lower, diluting the impact of screening. Arizona has moderate infectious density but lower inflow. Targeting Virginia strategically fills a regional defense gap by focusing on a high-risk source that might be overlooked if only the largest flows are considered. This focused approach balances detection utility and resource allocation, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next two weeks more effectively than screening higher volume but lower risk states."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density when considering the ratio of (E+I) to total population: (28934+14295)/6433672 「 0.0067, significantly higher than Arizona (~0.0049), Virginia (~0.0056), and Texas (~0.0003). Although Mississippi's average daily inbound flow into New Mexico is relatively low (1317), the screening's detection utility is impactful because it targets a concentrated hidden infectious population that would otherwise evade detection. By enforcing a 90percent screening on inbound travelers from Mississippi, a substantial portion of these exposed and infected individuals can be identified and quarantined immediately, effectively reducing the seeding of infections in New Mexico. While Texas and Arizona have larger inbound flows, their infectious densities are much lower, making their relative risk per traveler smaller. Targeting Mississippi fills a gap in regional defense by addressing a high-risk yet less obvious source, complementing typical focus areas like Texas and Arizona. This approach balances risk mitigation with resource allocation and enhances overall epidemic control by reducing importation of hidden cases from a notably infectious origin."

2025-12-24 19:44:59,600 - od_agent - INFO - Region texas policy response:
 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population 「 (38753+9067)/(8447412+38753+9067+58597+297893+2631), which is significantly greater than other states. This indicates Virginia poses the greatest risk of importing hidden infections into Texas. Virginia's average daily inbound flow into Texas is 26,290, a substantial volume that can introduce many exposed and infected individuals. Implementing a 90percent screening (Q-Conversion) on Virginia inbound travelers will effectively detect and isolate the majority of these hidden infections, reducing undetected community spread in Texas. Arizona and Mississippi also have notable infectious populations, but their infectious densities and inbound flows to Texas are lower or less impactful comparatively. New Mexico has a relatively low infectious density and moderate inbound flow, making it a less critical source for targeted screening. The selection of Virginia targets the most obvious, highest-risk origin state, aligning with coordinated regional defense efforts to reduce cross-state transmission from a major infectious reservoir. This approach balances detection utility with inbound traveler volume to maximize the reduction in Texas' cumulative confirmed cases and deaths over the next two weeks."

2025-12-24 19:45:04,980 - od_agent - INFO - Region virginia policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi has the highest infectious density calculated as (E+I)/Population, with E=28934 and I=14295 over a population of approximately 679962, yielding an infectious density of about 6.34percent, which is substantially higher than Arizona (~0.48percent), New Mexico (~0.05percent), and Texas (~0.03percent). The daily inbound flow from Mississippi to Virginia is moderate at 3517, which means a significant portion of potentially hidden infections could enter Virginia without intervention. Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy on Mississippi travelers would detect and convert 90percent of exposed and infected individuals into confirmed cases upon arrival, significantly reducing the hidden infectious population entering Virginia. This targeted approach focuses on the most epidemiologically risky origin, rather than dispersing resources on lower-risk states. By concentrating efforts on Mississippi, Virginia leverages a high-impact intervention to reduce importation risk and subsequent community transmission, aligning with systemic risk minimization. Coordination with other states may focus on obvious high-risk origins like Texas or Arizona due to their larger populations, but Mississippi's elevated infectious density and moderate travel volume present a unique vulnerability that this policy can address effectively. Thus, targeting Mississippi fills a critical gap in regional defense and helps minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia over the next 14 days."

2025-12-24 19:45:10,472 - od_agent - INFO - Region arizona policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, with 27487 exposed and 12156 infected out of an estimated total population around 6474992, yielding approximately 0.0061 infectious density. This is significantly higher than New Mexico (~0.00055), Texas (~0.0005), and Virginia (~0.0068 but with lower inbound flow). While Virginia has a comparable infectious density, its inbound flow to Arizona is much lower (5618) compared to Mississippi's 1731, but Mississippi's smaller population and the absolute number of infectious individuals entering Arizona via its 1731 daily travelers represent a higher relative risk. The screening mandate would effectively detect and convert 90percent of the exposed and infected arriving from Mississippi, substantially reducing the hidden infectious importation. Targeting Mississippi fills a critical gap since Texas, although having a large inbound flow (44065), has a lower infectious density, and New Mexico's infectious density and inbound risk are lower. This decision balances risk and impact by focusing on a high infectious density source with moderate mobility, thereby maximizing the reduction of imported hidden infections and complementing other states' control efforts. Hence, restricting inbound travelers from Mississippi with a rigorous screening policy is expected to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona over the next 14 days."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='In assessing the risk of inbound disease importation into Mississippi, we calculated the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state. Arizona shows an infectious density around 0.0063, new mexico about 0.00055, texas about 0.0005, and virginia around 0.0070, making virginia the highest infectious density source. Considering inbound flow volumes, texas contributes the largest daily inflow (39373), followed by virginia (3822), arizona (1718), and new mexico (1016). Though texas has a high volume, its infectious density is relatively low; conversely, virginia has the highest infectious density combined with moderate inflow. Screening inbound travelers from virginia with a 90percent detection rate effectively converts most hidden exposed and infected individuals to confirmed cases at arrival, significantly reducing the hidden infection load entering Mississippi. Targeting virginia addresses a high-risk state that may be under-monitored by others focusing on larger states like texas, thus filling a regional defense gap. This targeted inbound screening from virginia is expected to reduce cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi more effectively than screening from other states, balancing risk reduction with operational feasibility.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Mississippi shows a notably high infectious density with (E+I) = 39643 out of a population of approximately 609,449, yielding an infectious density of about 6.51percent, which is substantially higher than Arizona (~0.59percent), Texas (~0.05percent), and Virginia (~0.70percent). Although Texas has the highest absolute inbound flow to New Mexico (99,060), its infectious density is relatively low, making its per traveler risk smaller. Mississippi's inbound flow to New Mexico is small (1,372) but given its very high infectious density, even this modest flow poses a significant risk. Screening travelers from Mississippi would intercept approximately 90percent of the hidden infections (E and I), effectively converting them to confirmed cases (Q) and preventing their silent spread in New Mexico. Targeting Mississippi as the single origin state for rigorous inbound screening fills a critical gap in regional defense by focusing on a high-risk but less obvious source, rather than competing to screen higher-volume but lower risk states like Texas or Arizona. This targeted approach maximizes detection utility by focusing on infection prevalence rather than sheer volume, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the origin states, Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, with (47093+11031)/(8369255+47093+11031+71807+379832+2636) approximately 0.0071, which is substantially higher than Arizona (~0.0060), Mississippi (~0.0066), and New Mexico (~0.00055). Although Arizona has a very large inflow to Texas (45081 daily), Virginia¨s inflow (23716) is also significant, and its higher infectious density means more hidden infections are likely entering Texas. Implementing a targeted inbound screening on Virginia travelers would result in the capture and conversion of roughly 90percent of the exposed and infected individuals among those arriving from Virginia, thus significantly reducing the importation of hidden infections. This focused approach addresses a high-risk source that may be less likely targeted by others due to its moderate inflow compared to Arizona, thereby filling a critical gap in regional defense. Screening Virginia strikes an optimal balance between risk and operational feasibility, minimizing Texas¨s cumulative cases and deaths over the next two weeks by intercepting a disproportionately infectious inflow, while not overextending resources on states with either lower infectious densities or smaller effective inflows.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Evaluating the infectious density of origin states reveals that Mississippi presents the highest risk. Its combined exposed and infected population is 39,643 in a total population of approximately 784,695 (sum of compartments), yielding an infectious density around 5.05percent, substantially higher than Arizona (~0.56percent), New Mexico (~0.05percent), and Texas (~0.05percent). Despite a lower inbound flow into Virginia (3,518 daily), the high infectious density means Mississippi contributes a disproportionately large number of hidden infections entering Virginia. Implementing targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi, with a 90percent conversion of E and I to Q, would effectively intercept a significant portion of hidden infections, reducing disease importation and subsequent spread. Arizona, while having a higher inbound flow (5,287), has a much lower infectious density, making it less critical to target given resource constraints. Texas has the highest inflow (24,012) but very low infectious density, minimizing its relative risk. New Mexico poses the lowest risk both in terms of infectious density and inflow. Targeting Mississippi fills a crucial gap in regional defense by addressing a high-risk but less obvious source, complementing broader epidemic control efforts that may focus on states with higher mobility but lower infection rates. This focused approach balances screening resource allocation and epidemiological impact to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two weeks.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population approximately 55309/695719 or about 7.95percent, which is significantly higher than New Mexico (~0.065percent), Texas (~0.08percent), and Virginia (~0.08percent). Despite having a relatively low inbound flow to Arizona (~1989 per day), the high proportion of exposed and infected individuals suggests a substantial risk of importing hidden infections. Screening travelers from Mississippi would identify and quarantine approximately 90percent of these hidden cases among the inbound flow, effectively reducing the hidden infectious population entering Arizona. Texas and Virginia, while having higher absolute inbound flows (47229 and 5800 respectively), have much lower infectious densities, leading to fewer hidden infectious travelers proportionally. New Mexico has a large inbound flow (30633) but very low infectious density, making its contribution to risk lower. Targeting Mississippi is a strategic choice to address a critical gap in regional defense by focusing on a high-risk but less obvious source, rather than competing with other agents who might focus on high-volume but lower-risk states. This targeted inbound screening is expected to significantly reduce cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona over the next 14 days by intercepting a disproportionately high number of hidden infections from a concentrated source.'

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals critical insights. Virginia has (56374+13230)/ (8252119+56374+13230+86922+479681+2636) approximately 0.0085 infectious density, which is significantly higher than Texas (7344+12144)/~22,618,424 「 0.00087, New Mexico (4150+913)/~7,634,718 「 0.00066, and Arizona (61856+3945)/~8,988,873 「 0.0074. The high infectious density combined with a moderate average daily inbound flow of 4112 travelers into Mississippi suggests that Virginia poses a substantial importation risk. Screening inbound travelers from Virginia with a 90percent detection mandate would capture a large portion of hidden infections (E and I) before they integrate into Mississippi's community, significantly reducing potential new cases and deaths. While Texas has a much higher volume of inbound travelers (39010) but a lower infectious density, the sheer volume is offset by relatively lower infection prevalence, making Virginia the more efficient screening target. Targeting Virginia addresses a critical gap in regional defense by focusing on a highly infectious source with moderate mobility rather than competing with other regions that might prioritize Texas or Arizona. This targeted inbound screening policy balances resource allocation and epidemiological impact effectively to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density calculated as (E+I)/Population. Specifically, Mississippi's exposed and infected sum to 55309 over a total population of approximately 547205, yielding an infectious density of about 10.11percent, which is substantially higher than Arizona (~0.76percent), Texas (~0.08percent), and Virginia (~0.08percent). Despite Mississippi's relatively low average daily inbound flow into New Mexico (1497), targeting this state for enhanced screening offers a high detection utility; screening 90percent of inbound flows from Mississippi would capture a large fraction of hidden infections (E and I), directly converting them into confirmed cases (Q) upon arrival. This targeted approach leverages the high prevalence risk from a smaller but more infectious population segment, effectively reducing the importation of unconfirmed infectious individuals. Choosing Mississippi reflects a strategic coordination to fill a gap in regional defense, as other states with larger flows but lower infectious density could overwhelm resources if prioritized instead. Arizona and Texas have higher inbound flows but substantially lower infectious densities, making screening less efficient per traveler screened. Virginia has moderate infectious density but also lower inflow. Therefore, prioritizing Mississippi balances detection utility and systemic risk reduction, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next 14 days."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi presents the highest infectious density, calculated by (E+I)/Population, indicating a greater proportion of hidden infectious individuals relative to its population size, despite having a smaller absolute population than others. Specifically, Mississippi's infectious density is approximately 9.6percent, substantially higher than Arizona (~0.73percent), New Mexico (~0.067percent), and Virginia (~0.83percent). Although Arizona and Virginia have large absolute numbers of infectious individuals, their massive populations dilute the infection density, lowering the relative risk per traveler. The inbound flow from Mississippi to Texas is 29,421 daily, which is moderate but sufficient to pose a significant importation risk given the high infectious density. Implementing a targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi would capture and convert approximately 90percent of exposed and infected individuals entering Texas, substantially reducing the hidden infectious inflow and thus the potential seeding of new cases. This strategy leverages a gap in regional defense since other agents might focus on higher absolute volume states like Arizona or Virginia, leaving Mississippi as a relatively under-monitored but high-risk source. Screening Mississippi travelers balances resource allocation and epidemiological impact, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population approximately (40609+14700)/(547205+40609+14700+9725+122486+3531) 「 0.09, significantly higher than Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Mississippi's population is much smaller, but the proportion of hidden infections is substantial, posing a strong risk of importing exposed and infected individuals. The average daily inbound flow from Mississippi into Virginia is moderate at 3739, which implies a meaningful volume of travelers potentially carrying infection. By enforcing a 90percent screening and quarantine conversion on Mississippi arrivals, we can effectively detect and isolate a large fraction of these hidden infections, sharply reducing the importation of infectious individuals into Virginia. Arizona has a large population and high inbound flow but lower infectious density, and Texas, despite large flows, has comparatively lower infectious density. New Mexico has the lowest infectious density and inbound flow. Targeting Mississippi addresses a critical regional risk that might be under-protected by other states focusing on larger origins like Texas or Arizona, thus filling a gap in regional defense. This focused intervention optimizes detection utility by capturing a significant portion of hidden infections relative to flow, balancing systemic risk reduction and resource allocation. Therefore, selecting Mississippi for targeted inbound screening best minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population = (54308+20193)/6606055 「 0.0114, which is significantly higher than New Mexico's 0.0008, Texas's 0.0009, and Virginia's 0.0102. Despite its smaller population, Mississippi's relatively high exposed and infected proportions indicate a concentrated risk of importing hidden infections into Arizona. The inbound flow from Mississippi to Arizona is moderate at 2279 daily travelers. Implementing a targeted inbound screening policy focusing on Mississippi would capture approximately 90percent of the hidden infections (E+I) in these 2279 travelers, substantially reducing the importation of undetected cases. In contrast, New Mexico and Texas have much larger inbound flows but far lower infectious densities, making their relative risk per traveler lower. Virginia has a somewhat comparable infectious density but a smaller inbound volume (6174) compared to Texas and New Mexico. Targeting Mississippi is a strategic choice to address a significant high-risk source that may be overlooked if attention is only placed on larger states with lower infection rates per capita. This approach complements broader regional efforts by focusing resources on a key high-infection-density inflow, thereby optimizing detection utility and reducing cumulative cases and deaths in Arizona more effectively over the next 14 days."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the given origin states, Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population = (66579 + 15659) / (8142557 + 66579 + 15659 + 103864 + 599797 + 2636) approximately 0.01 or 1percent, which is notably higher than Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. This indicates a substantial hidden infectious population potentially entering Mississippi. Considering inbound flows, while Texas has the highest absolute inflow into Mississippi (38445 daily), its infectious density is lower. Virginia's inbound flow of 4465 daily, although smaller, combined with higher infectious density, results in a meaningful number of hidden infections entering Mississippi. Implementing targeted screening on Virginia arrivals will capture and convert approximately 90percent of these hidden infected (E and I) individuals to confirmed (Q), substantially reducing the risk of undetected disease importation. Selecting Virginia as the restricted state strategically targets a high-risk but less obvious source, complementing other states that may focus on Texas or Arizona, thereby improving regional defense coordination. This targeted inbound screening balances impact and feasibility, aiming to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi has the highest infectious density calculated as (E+I)/Population, with (54308+20193)/499789 「 0.149, which is substantially higher than Arizona (「0.0063), Texas (「0.0010), and Virginia (「0.0102). Although Mississippi's inbound flow to New Mexico is relatively low at 1459 daily travelers, the high infectious density means each traveler carries a significant risk of importing hidden infections. Implementing targeted inbound screening on Mississippi arrivals, with a 90percent detection and conversion of exposed and infected individuals to confirmed cases upon entry, will effectively reduce the hidden infectious population entering New Mexico from this high-risk source. Arizona and Texas, despite larger inbound flows, have much lower infectious densities, making the detection utility per traveler less impactful in proportion. Virginia's infectious density is higher than Arizona and Texas but still far below Mississippi's level. Targeting Mississippi fills a critical gap in regional defense by focusing on a smaller but highly infectious source that might be overlooked if only large inflow states are considered. This strategy complements broader regional efforts by reducing importation from a concentrated hotspot, thus minimizing new cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks with an efficient and focused intervention."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, where E=66579 and I=15659 with a population approximated by the sum S+E+I+Q+R+D=8142557+66579+15659+103864+599797+2636=8,377,092, resulting in an infectious density of approximately 0.0097. This is significantly higher than Arizona (approx. 0.0063), Mississippi (approx. 0.0485 but with far lower population inflow), and New Mexico (approx. 0.0008). Despite Mississippi's seemingly high infectious numbers, its inbound flow to Texas is much lower (30676) compared to Virginia's (24801) and New Mexico's (146052). However, New Mexico's infectious density is very low, reducing its risk. Screening at Virginia's border would capture about 90percent of hidden infections entering Texas from this source. Considering Virginia's combination of moderate inbound flow and highest infectious density, targeting this origin state maximizes detection and reduces importation risk. Coordination-wise, Virginia is less frequently targeted compared to well-known hotspots like Arizona or Mississippi, filling a critical gap in regional defense. This targeted screening policy on Virginia inbound travelers for two weeks will effectively reduce hidden infectious arrivals and minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Texas."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among all origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population approximately 74,501/(5,037,680) 「 0.0148, significantly higher than Arizona (~0.0062), New Mexico (~0.0008), and Texas (~0.0009). Despite Mississippi's relatively low average daily inbound flow into Virginia (~3551), the high prevalence of Exposed and Infected travelers poses a disproportionate risk of importing hidden infections. Implementing targeted inbound screening for Mississippi travelers would intercept approximately 90percent of these hidden infections (E and I) before they mix with the community, effectively reducing the risk of seeding new transmission chains in Virginia. Arizona and Texas have higher absolute inbound flows but lower infectious densities, meaning that while they contribute more travelers, the proportion of hidden infections is lower. New Mexico has both low infectious density and low inflow, making it a less critical source. Targeting Mississippi fills a regional defense gap by focusing on a smaller but higher-risk source, complementing broader regional controls and avoiding redundant efforts on the more obvious larger states. This focused intervention is expected to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia over the 14-day horizon by sharply reducing imported hidden infections from the highest-risk origin state."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population approximately 0.0201, driven by a large exposed (68774) and infected (26545) population relative to its size (~6.63 million). Although its absolute population is smaller than Texas or Virginia, its infectious density is significantly higher. The average daily inbound flow from Mississippi to Arizona is modest at 1918 travelers, which makes targeted screening operationally feasible and impactful. Implementing a 90percent screening mandate on travelers from Mississippi will effectively convert a large fraction of hidden infections (E and I) into confirmed (Q) cases upon arrival, substantially reducing the risk of undetected disease importation. In contrast, Texas and Virginia have lower infectious densities (~0.0013 and ~0.0122 respectively) despite higher inbound flows, and New Mexico's infectious density is very low (~0.0010) even though it has high inbound flow. Targeting Mississippi addresses a high-risk but less obvious source, complementing potential policies by other states that might prioritize larger states like Texas. This targeted intervention fills a crucial gap in regional defense by focusing on a smaller but disproportionately infectious origin, optimizing Arizona's inbound monitoring resources to minimize cumulative cases and deaths during the 14-day horizon."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state reveals that Virginia has a notably high infectious density compared to others: Virginia's E+I is 77,320 + 18,230 = 95,550 over a population approximately 8,048,646, yielding an infectious density of about 0.01187. Arizona's infectious density is (94,533 + 6,020) / 9,168,178 「 0.01103; New Mexico's is (7,316 + 1,582) / 8,917,500 「 0.00105; Texas's is (10,475 + 17,108) / 20,830,556 「 0.00131. Thus, Virginia and Arizona are the highest-risk sources. However, inbound daily flow from Virginia into Mississippi is 4,247, while from Arizona it is only 2,086. Targeting Virginia for screening provides higher utility by intercepting a greater number of hidden infections entering Mississippi. Estimating hidden infections captured: 90percent of (E+I) inbound, so for Virginia inbound 4,247 travelers with infectious density ~0.01187, expected hidden infections entering daily 「 4,247 〜 0.01187 「 50.4; 90percent screening converts ~45 hidden infections daily to confirmed, significantly reducing undetected infectious traveler risk. In contrast, Arizona's lower flow and slightly lower infectious density would yield fewer intercepted cases despite its high infectious density. Coordinating with other regions likely focuses on obvious high-risk states like Arizona; by targeting Virginia, Mississippi fills a regional gap in defense, enhancing overall containment. Therefore, implementing a targeted inbound screening policy for travelers from Virginia optimally minimizes imported hidden infections and subsequent cases and deaths within Mississippi over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Mississippi presents the highest infectious density among origin states when considering (E+I)/Population, with (E+I) = 68774 + 26545 = 95319 over a population approximated by S+E+I+Q+R+D = 467305 + 68774 + 26545 + 16014 + 153511 + 4019 = 718168, yielding an infectious density of approximately 13.3percent. This is significantly higher than Arizona (~1.2percent), Texas (~0.13percent), and Virginia (~0.31percent). The inbound flow from Mississippi into New Mexico is low (1137 average daily travelers) but screening here is highly impactful because a large fraction of these travelers are potentially infectious. With a 90percent screening efficacy, we could identify and convert about 90percent of hidden infections in these travelers into confirmed cases, effectively preventing a substantial number of infectious individuals from seeding new infections in New Mexico. Targeting Mississippi, a secondary source with a high infection density but low travel volume, complements broader regional defense by filling a gap that might be overlooked if focusing only on high-volume but lower-density sources like Texas or Arizona. Arizona and Texas have much larger travel flows but comparatively much lower infectious densities, so screening there would require more resources with less relative benefit. Virginia has moderate infection density but very low inbound flow, making its overall risk smaller. Therefore, implementing targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi is the optimal strategy to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks.'

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Considering the infectious density (E+I)/Population of each origin state, Virginia presents the highest combined infectious density among the options: (77320+18230)/~8 million, approximately 0.0124, compared to Arizona (~0.0117), Mississippi (~0.06 but with much smaller population), and New Mexico (~0.001). However, Mississippi has a notably high infectious density but its inbound flow to Texas is lower (28922) compared to Virginia (25030) and New Mexico (134761). The daily inbound flow from Virginia is moderate, making it a strategic target where screening can be most effective in reducing hidden infections. Screening 90percent of exposed and infected travelers from Virginia can significantly reduce the influx of hidden infections into Texas, effectively converting a large fraction of those into confirmed cases (Q), thus better isolating them and reducing community spread. Although Arizona has a large infectious population, its inbound flow to Texas is lower (45426) than New Mexico's (134761), but New Mexico's infectious density is much lower, reducing the benefit of screening there. Targeting Virginia balances risk and mobility volume to maximize detection utility. Choosing Virginia also complements other states' policies by focusing on a significant but less obvious source, filling regional defense gaps rather than competing on the highest-risk origin. This targeted screening policy will help minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas by intercepting a substantial portion of incoming hidden infections over the next 14 days."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi presents the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population approximately 0.067, significantly higher than Arizona (~0.011), New Mexico (~0.001), and Texas (~0.0013). Despite its smaller population, Mississippi's high concentration of exposed and infected individuals poses a substantial importation risk to Virginia. The daily inbound flow from Mississippi to Virginia is moderate (3545), enough to impact Virginia's epidemic trajectory if unchecked. By implementing a targeted inbound screening on Mississippi, 90percent of exposed and infected travelers will be detected and quarantined upon arrival, effectively reducing hidden infections entering Virginia. This targeted approach prioritizes a secondary source with a high infectious density but relatively lower flow, optimizing resource allocation and complementing potential screening efforts by other states on high-flow states like Texas. Screening Mississippi travelers fills a regional defense gap, minimizing systemic risk without overlapping with obvious high-volume states that other agents might target. This policy is expected to significantly reduce cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia over the next 14 days by intercepting high-risk inbound travelers from a concentrated infection hotspot."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population approximately 119099/6630556 「 0.01796, significantly higher than Texas (~0.00205), Virginia (~0.0037), and New Mexico (~0.0013). Mississippi's inbound flow to Arizona is relatively low at 1900 daily travelers, but these travelers carry a disproportionately high risk of hidden infections. The screening at Arizona's border targeting Mississippi travelers could convert 90percent of these hidden infections (E and I) into confirmed cases (Q), thereby substantially reducing the importation of undetected infectious individuals. This focused intervention addresses a high-risk but often overlooked source, complementing broader regional defenses that might prioritize larger states like Texas. Texas, while having the highest daily inflow (50257), has a much lower infectious density, diluting the impact of screening. New Mexico and Virginia have moderate infectious densities and inflows but do not surpass Mississippi's risk profile. Selecting Mississippi balances the trade-off between infectious density and inbound flow, maximizing detection utility while filling a gap in regional coordination. Hence, implementing targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi for the next 14 days will most effectively minimize new confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona."

 policy={'virginia': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the origin states, Virginia exhibits the highest infectious density defined as (E+I)/Population. Calculating approximate infectious densities: Arizona (E+I) ~122443 / population ~8,577,274 yields about 0.0143; New Mexico (E+I) ~12,275 / population ~9,740,761 yields ~0.00126; Texas (E+I) ~40,957 / population ~20,023,724 yields ~0.00204; Virginia (E+I) ~109,094 / population ~8,008,975 yields ~0.0136. Though Arizona has slightly higher infectious density, its inbound flow to Mississippi is very low (2050 daily), limiting its importation risk. Texas has a large inbound flow (35622 daily) but moderate infectious density. Virginia combines a relatively high infectious density with moderate inbound flow (3845 daily), making it the state with the highest risk of importing hidden infections. Screening at Virginia¨s inbound flow (3845 travelers daily) with 90percent detection of E and I means a significant number of hidden infections will be identified and isolated, thus reducing silent seeding. Choosing Virginia as the target balances the risk and flow more effectively than Arizona, which despite high density has minimal flow, or Texas, which has high flow but lower infectious density. This strategic targeting complements regional efforts by focusing on a secondary yet significant infection source, thereby filling a gap in border disease control to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next 14 days.'

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the inbound origin states, Mississippi exhibits an exceptionally high infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, where E=84810 and I=34289 over a population sum of approximately 84810+34289+430573+20968+176546+4314, indicating a significantly elevated proportion of exposed and infected individuals relative to its size. Despite its lower absolute population compared to states like Texas and Arizona, Mississippi's infectious density far exceeds others, signaling a concentrated risk of disease importation. The average daily inbound flow from Mississippi into New Mexico is relatively low (1129), which means targeted screening here can be highly efficient and manageable in logistics. Implementing a 90percent screening and detection policy on travelers from Mississippi will convert a large fraction of hidden infections (E and I) into confirmed cases (Q) upon arrival, substantially reducing the risk of silent spread. While Arizona and Texas have higher absolute inbound flows, their infectious densities are considerably lower, making them less critical targets for focused screening given resource constraints. Targeting Mississippi fills a critical gap in regional defense by addressing a high-risk but less obvious source, complementing broader measures and avoiding duplication of efforts that might focus on the more obvious large states. This selective intervention balances systemic risk reduction with operational feasibility, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement targeted inbound screening focuses on Mississippi due to its notably high infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, which is approximately (84810+34289)/(430573+84810+34289+20968+176546+4314) 「 0.28, indicating a very high proportion of hidden infections relative to its population compared to other states. Although Arizona and Virginia have larger absolute numbers, their infectious densities are lower and their inbound flows to Texas are also significantly less than Mississippi's. New Mexico has a moderate infectious density but much lower E and I values and a higher inbound flow, which would dilute the screening impact. By selecting Mississippi, the screening will capture a substantial portion of hidden infections; with 90percent detection efficacy applied to the average daily inbound flow of 28,405 travelers, a significant number of exposed or infected individuals will be rerouted to confirmed quarantine status upon arrival, effectively reducing Texas's importation risk. This choice also complements regional defense strategies by addressing a secondary but high-risk source, rather than overlapping with potentially more obvious high-volume states like Arizona or New Mexico, balancing coordination with other states' policies. Thus, targeting Mississippi optimizes the reduction of cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas over the next 14 days."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="The decision to implement targeted inbound screening for travelers arriving from Mississippi is based on a thorough assessment of source risk profiles and potential detection benefits. Mississippi exhibits a very high infectious density with (E+I) = 84810 + 34289 = 119099 in a population of roughly 430573, which yields an infectious density of approximately 27.68percent, significantly higher than other origin states. Although Mississippi's inbound flow to Virginia is relatively low at 3183 daily travelers, the high infectious density means a substantial fraction of these travelers could be hidden carriers (E and I). By enforcing rigorous 90percent screening upon entry, we can effectively identify and quarantine a large portion of these hidden infections, drastically reducing the risk of seeding new cases in Virginia. In contrast, while Arizona and Texas have much higher inbound flows (4029 and 20129 respectively), their infectious densities are considerably lower (Arizona ~1.5percent, Texas ~0.2percent), making screening less efficient at capturing hidden infections per traveler screened. New Mexico has very low infectious density and low inflow. Selecting Mississippi targets a high-risk, under-monitored source that may be overlooked by other states focusing on major traffic corridors, thus filling a crucial gap in regional epidemic control. This targeted approach balances detection utility and systemic risk, aiming to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia over the next 14 days."

2025-12-24 19:47:32,957 - od_agent - INFO - Region arizona policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Among the four origin states！Mississippi, New Mexico, Texas, and Virginia！Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, with approximately 34.1percent (E=84256 + I=34733 out of roughly 6318817 population), significantly higher than others. This signals a substantial hidden infection burden in travelers from Mississippi. Coupled with a moderate daily inbound flow to Arizona (2184), targeting Mississippi for rigorous 90percent inbound screening will effectively intercept a large number of exposed and infected individuals, converting them into confirmed cases and preventing silent seeding within Arizona. Although Texas and New Mexico have higher absolute inbound flows (59869 and 46636 respectively), their infectious densities are far lower, making screening less impactful per traveler screened. Virginia also has a moderate infectious density but lower inbound flow compared to Mississippi. By focusing on Mississippi, we address a high-risk but less obvious source, complementing potential efforts by other states that might target larger flow origins. This targeted intervention balances risk and resource allocation, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona over the next two weeks effectively.'

 policy={'arizona': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the four origin states, Arizona exhibits the highest infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, indicating a greater proportion of hidden infections relative to its population. Specifically, Arizona's exposed and infected sum to 145,050 over a population of approximately 8,991,054, yielding an infectious density around 1.61percent. New Mexico and Texas have much lower infectious densities (~0.16percent and ~0.22percent respectively), while Virginia is moderately high (~1.58percent). Arizona also has a significant average daily inflow into Mississippi of 1,891 travelers, which, combined with its high infectious density, poses a considerable risk of importing undetected infections. Implementing targeted inbound screening for travelers from Arizona will capture and convert approximately 90percent of the exposed and infected individuals entering Mississippi, substantially reducing the hidden infectious population that could seed new cases locally. Although Virginia has a comparable infectious density, its inflow is lower (4,629), and Texas, despite a high inflow (47,560), has a lower infectious density, making Arizona the optimal target. This choice prioritizes mitigating the most significant risk source and complements broader regional control efforts by focusing on a high-risk but less obvious origin, filling a strategic gap. Thus, targeting Arizona balances high infectious risk and manageable traveler volume to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi over the next two weeks."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Analyzing the infectious density, Mississippi shows the highest combined Exposed and Infected population relative to its total population, with (E+I) = 118989, which is extremely high given its total population (sum of compartments ~1,000,000+). Mississippi's infectious density far exceeds that of Arizona, Texas, and Virginia. Although Mississippi's average daily inbound flow into New Mexico is the lowest (1008), the risk per traveler is substantially higher, making it a critical source of hidden infections. Implementing targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi will identify and quarantine approximately ninety percent of infected and exposed individuals entering New Mexico from this state, significantly reducing the hidden infectious importation. Targeting Mississippi addresses a high-risk but less obvious source, complementing likely efforts by other agents focusing on larger states like Texas or Arizona, thereby filling a regional defense gap. Arizona and Texas have higher inbound flows but lower infectious densities, making screening less efficient per traveler. Virginia, while having moderate infectious density, has minimal flow into New Mexico. Therefore, the policy prioritizes minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by focusing on the highest risk per traveler source while balancing limited enforcement resources for maximal impact."

2025-12-24 19:47:50,135 - od_agent - INFO - Region texas policy response:
 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="In evaluating the risk profiles of origin states to Texas, Mississippi stands out due to its extremely high infectious density despite a smaller population size. Calculating infectious density as (E+I)/Population, Mississippi's exposed plus infected total is 118989 out of roughly 560,000 people (sum of all compartments), yielding a very high infection prevalence compared to other states. Arizona and Virginia also have large absolute numbers but much larger populations, resulting in lower infectious densities. New Mexico shows the lowest infectious density among these. The inbound flow from Mississippi to Texas is 38,606 daily on average, which is moderate but significant. Implementing targeted inbound screening on Mississippi travelers would capture approximately 90percent of the exposed and infected individuals attempting entry, which translates into a substantial reduction of hidden infections entering Texas due to the high prevalence in Mississippi. This targeted approach effectively reduces disease importation risk from the highest-risk origin in terms of infection density and hidden infectious population per traveler. Choosing Mississippi also fills a gap in regional defense because other agents might prioritize larger states like Arizona or Virginia due to their population size and mobility volume, but Mississippi¨s high infectious density and moderate flow make it a critical secondary source to control. Thus, restricting inbound travelers from Mississippi with rigorous screening maximizes detection utility and minimizes disease importation risk, helping curb cumulative cases and deaths in Texas over the next 14 days."

 policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Evaluating the infectious density (E+I)/Population for each origin state relative to Virginia reveals Mississippi as having the highest density of infectious individuals entering Virginia. Mississippi's exposed and infected populations sum to 118989 against a total population of approximately 1,005,927 (sum of all compartments), yielding a notably high infectious density compared to Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Although Arizona has a higher absolute population, its infectious density is lower. Incoming flow from Mississippi to Virginia, while smaller than some states, still represents a meaningful channel for disease importation. Implementing a 90percent screening and detection policy on travelers from Mississippi maximizes identification and quarantine of hidden infections, effectively reducing the seeding of new cases within Virginia. Targeting Mississippi addresses a critical secondary source of risk that might be undervalued in broader regional control efforts focused on larger states like Texas or Arizona, thus complementing regional defense strategies. This focused intervention minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by cutting off a disproportionately high-risk infection source with moderate inbound flow, achieving efficient epidemic control under resource constraints."
