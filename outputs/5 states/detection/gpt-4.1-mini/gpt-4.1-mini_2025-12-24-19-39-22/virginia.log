2025-12-24 19:47:00,698 - virginia - INFO - Parsed PolicyResponse: policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation="Among the origin states, Mississippi presents the highest infectious density with (E+I)/Population approximately 0.067, significantly higher than Arizona (~0.011), New Mexico (~0.001), and Texas (~0.0013). Despite its smaller population, Mississippi's high concentration of exposed and infected individuals poses a substantial importation risk to Virginia. The daily inbound flow from Mississippi to Virginia is moderate (3545), enough to impact Virginia's epidemic trajectory if unchecked. By implementing a targeted inbound screening on Mississippi, 90percent of exposed and infected travelers will be detected and quarantined upon arrival, effectively reducing hidden infections entering Virginia. This targeted approach prioritizes a secondary source with a high infectious density but relatively lower flow, optimizing resource allocation and complementing potential screening efforts by other states on high-flow states like Texas. Screening Mississippi travelers fills a regional defense gap, minimizing systemic risk without overlapping with obvious high-volume states that other agents might target. This policy is expected to significantly reduce cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia over the next 14 days by intercepting high-risk inbound travelers from a concentrated infection hotspot."

  "global_guidance": "The decision to implement targeted inbound screening for travelers arriving from Mississippi is based on a thorough assessment of source risk profiles and potential detection benefits. Mississippi exhibits a very high infectious density with (E+I) = 84810 + 34289 = 119099 in a population of roughly 430573, which yields an infectious density of approximately 27.68%, significantly higher than other origin states. Although Mississippi's inbound flow to Virginia is relatively low at 3183 daily travelers, the high infectious density means a substantial fraction of these travelers could be hidden carriers (E and I). By enforcing rigorous 90% screening upon entry, we can effectively identify and quarantine a large portion of these hidden infections, drastically reducing the risk of seeding new cases in Virginia. In contrast, while Arizona and Texas have much higher inbound flows (4029 and 20129 respectively), their infectious densities are considerably lower (Arizona ~1.5%, Texas ~0.2%), making screening less efficient at capturing hidden infections per traveler screened. New Mexico has very low infectious density and low inflow. Selecting Mississippi targets a high-risk, under-monitored source that may be overlooked by other states focusing on major traffic corridors, thus filling a crucial gap in regional epidemic control. This targeted approach balances detection utility and systemic risk, aiming to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia over the next 14 days."
