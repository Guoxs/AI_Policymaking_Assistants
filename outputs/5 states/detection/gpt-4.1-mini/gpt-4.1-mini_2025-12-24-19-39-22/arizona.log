Although its absolute population is smaller than Texas or Virginia, its infectious density is significantly higher. The average daily inbound flow from Mississippi to Arizona is modest at 1918 travelers, which makes targeted screening operationally feasible and impactful. Implementing a 90percent screening mandate on travelers from Mississippi will effectively convert a large fraction of hidden infections (E and I) into confirmed (Q) cases upon arrival, substantially reducing the risk of undetected disease importation. In contrast, Texas and Virginia have lower infectious densities (~0.0013 and ~0.0122 respectively) despite higher inbound flows, and New Mexico's infectious density is very low (~0.0010) even though it has high inbound flow. Targeting Mississippi addresses a high-risk but less obvious source, complementing potential policies by other states that might prioritize larger states like Texas. This targeted intervention fills a crucial gap in regional defense by focusing on a smaller but disproportionately infectious origin, optimizing Arizona's inbound monitoring resources to minimize cumulative cases and deaths during the 14-day horizon."

Mississippi's inbound flow to Arizona is relatively low at 1900 daily travelers, but these travelers carry a disproportionately high risk of hidden infections. The screening at Arizona's border targeting Mississippi travelers could convert 90% of these hidden infections (E and I) into confirmed cases (Q), thereby substantially reducing the importation of undetected infectious individuals. This focused intervention addresses a high-risk but often overlooked source, complementing broader regional defenses that might prioritize larger states like Texas. Texas, while having the highest daily inflow (50257), has a much lower infectious density, diluting the impact of screening. New Mexico and Virginia have moderate infectious densities and inflows but do not surpass Mississippi's risk profile. Selecting Mississippi balances the trade-off between infectious density and inbound flow, maximizing detection utility while filling a gap in regional coordination. Hence, implementing targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi for the next 14 days will most effectively minimize new confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona."
