Mississippi exhibits the highest infectious density among the origin states, with (E+I)/Population approximately 0.0199 (27885+13292)/2118693, significantly higher than Arizona (~0.0016), Texas (~0.00022), and Virginia (~0.0021). This high infectious density indicates a substantial hidden infectious population potentially entering New Mexico. Although Mississippi's average daily inbound flow to New Mexico is relatively low (1605), the high infection prevalence means that even a small number of travelers could disproportionately contribute to new infections. Implementing a 90% screening and detection protocol on inbound travelers from Mississippi would effectively convert most exposed and infected individuals into confirmed cases upon arrival, reducing hidden transmission chains. This intervention targets a secondary but high-risk source, complementing and filling gaps in regional defenses that may focus on larger origin states but with lower infection densities. Arizona and Texas have much higher inbound flows but lower infectious densities, making screening less efficient in detection per traveler. Virginia's risk is moderate but still lower than Mississippi. Therefore, focusing resources on Mississippi provides a strategic balance between infection risk and detection utility to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks."

This is significantly higher than Arizona (~1.2%), Texas (~0.13%), and Virginia (~0.31%). The inbound flow from Mississippi into New Mexico is low (1137 average daily travelers) but screening here is highly impactful because a large fraction of these travelers are potentially infectious. With a 90% screening efficacy, we could identify and convert about 90% of hidden infections in these travelers into confirmed cases, effectively preventing a substantial number of infectious individuals from seeding new infections in New Mexico. Targeting Mississippi, a secondary source with a high infection density but low travel volume, complements broader regional defense by filling a gap that might be overlooked if focusing only on high-volume but lower-density sources like Texas or Arizona. Arizona and Texas have much larger travel flows but comparatively much lower infectious densities, so screening there would require more resources with less relative benefit. Virginia has moderate infection density but very low inbound flow, making its overall risk smaller. Therefore, implementing targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi is the optimal strategy to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks."

2025-12-24 19:46:49,677 - new mexico - INFO - Parsed PolicyResponse: policy={'mississippi': [0.5, 0.5]} explanation='Mississippi presents the highest infectious density among origin states when considering (E+I)/Population, with (E+I) = 68774 + 26545 = 95319 over a population approximated by S+E+I+Q+R+D = 467305 + 68774 + 26545 + 16014 + 153511 + 4019 = 718168, yielding an infectious density of approximately 13.3percent. This is significantly higher than Arizona (~1.2percent), Texas (~0.13percent), and Virginia (~0.31percent). The inbound flow from Mississippi into New Mexico is low (1137 average daily travelers) but screening here is highly impactful because a large fraction of these travelers are potentially infectious. With a 90percent screening efficacy, we could identify and convert about 90percent of hidden infections in these travelers into confirmed cases, effectively preventing a substantial number of infectious individuals from seeding new infections in New Mexico. Targeting Mississippi, a secondary source with a high infection density but low travel volume, complements broader regional defense by filling a gap that might be overlooked if focusing only on high-volume but lower-density sources like Texas or Arizona. Arizona and Texas have much larger travel flows but comparatively much lower infectious densities, so screening there would require more resources with less relative benefit. Virginia has moderate infection density but very low inbound flow, making its overall risk smaller. Therefore, implementing targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi is the optimal strategy to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks.'

  "global_guidance": "Among the inbound origin states, Mississippi exhibits an exceptionally high infectious density, calculated as (E+I)/Population, where E=84810 and I=34289 over a population sum of approximately 84810+34289+430573+20968+176546+4314, indicating a significantly elevated proportion of exposed and infected individuals relative to its size. Despite its lower absolute population compared to states like Texas and Arizona, Mississippi's infectious density far exceeds others, signaling a concentrated risk of disease importation. The average daily inbound flow from Mississippi into New Mexico is relatively low (1129), which means targeted screening here can be highly efficient and manageable in logistics. Implementing a 90% screening and detection policy on travelers from Mississippi will convert a large fraction of hidden infections (E and I) into confirmed cases (Q) upon arrival, substantially reducing the risk of silent spread. While Arizona and Texas have higher absolute inbound flows, their infectious densities are considerably lower, making them less critical targets for focused screening given resource constraints. Targeting Mississippi fills a critical gap in regional defense by addressing a high-risk but less obvious source, complementing broader measures and avoiding duplication of efforts that might focus on the more obvious large states. This selective intervention balances systemic risk reduction with operational feasibility, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next two weeks."
