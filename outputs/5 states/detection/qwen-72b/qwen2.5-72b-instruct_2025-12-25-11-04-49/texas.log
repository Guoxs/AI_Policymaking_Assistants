By implementing targeted screening on Mississippi, we can capture approximately 2,087 (E+I) individuals over the 14-day period, converting them directly to Q-status. This approach helps minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas while addressing a significant risk point. While Arizona and Virginia also have high infectious densities, Mississippi's lower baseline inflow makes it a more manageable target for screening, potentially filling a gap in regional defense without overwhelming resources."
