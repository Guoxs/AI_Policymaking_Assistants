By implementing targeted inbound screening on travelers from Mississippi, we can capture and convert approximately 27percent of the inbound flow's hidden infections (E and I) to Q-status, significantly reducing the risk of undetected disease spread into Virginia. This approach balances the need to minimize imported cases while avoiding over-concentration on the most obvious high-risk state, which might already be under scrutiny by other neighboring states."
