After analyzing the origin states, we decide to target Texas, as it has the highest Infectious Density $(E+I)/Population$ of 0.0027, which poses the highest risk of disease importation. The Detection Utility of the screening is estimated to be high, as Texas has a significant number of exposed and infected individuals. By targeting Texas, we can capture a substantial number of 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) and convert them to Q-status, reducing the risk of disease spread in New Mexico. This targeted approach also helps to fill a gap in regional defense, as Texas is a major source of inbound traffic to New Mexico. Implementing a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for Texas will significantly reduce the 'hidden' infectious population entering New Mexico, thereby minimizing the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in the state."

Arizona's high Infectious Density (E+I)/Population of 0.0155 (12508/8303349) indicates a higher risk of disease importation. Implementing a rigorous ninety percent screening mandate at the border, as described in the Q-Conversion, will significantly reduce the 'hidden' infectious population entering New Mexico. This targeted approach minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico while managing the systemic risks of disease importation. The Detection Utility of this policy is substantial, as it will capture a significant number of 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) and convert them to Q-status upon arrival. Considering the Coordination vs. Competition aspect, targeting Arizona fills a gap in regional defense, as it is a neighboring state with a high risk profile, making it a more effective and focused effort compared to targeting a more distant state."

Based on the Infectious Density (E+I)/Population of origin states, Texas has the highest rate, with 0.0110. In addition, the beta value for New Mexico is 0.1117782502495318, indicating a relatively high transmission rate. By targeting Texas, we can capture and convert a significant number of 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) to Q-status via the screening, effectively reducing the 'hidden' infectious population entering our community. This policy aims to strike a balance between coordination and competition, as targeting the high-risk state Texas fills a gap in regional defense while minimizing the risk of missed infections from other origin states. The rigorous ninety percent screening mandate will be enforced for travelers entering New Mexico from Texas, effectively identifying and moving individuals from the Exposed (E) and Infected (I) compartments directly into the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival. This intervention is expected to significantly reduce the disease spread and minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico."
