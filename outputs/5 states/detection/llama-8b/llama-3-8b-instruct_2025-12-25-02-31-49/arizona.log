The 'Source Risk Profile' evaluation reveals that Mississippi has a relatively high 'Infectious Density' of $(906+1753)/2970629 \approx 0.007$, which is higher than the other origin states. The 'Detection Utility' of the screening policy is estimated to convert approximately 90% of the 'Hidden Infections' in Mississippi into 'Confirmed' cases, effectively reducing the influx of infectious individuals into Arizona. In terms of 'Coordination vs. Competition', targeting Mississippi fills a gap in regional defense, as it is not the obvious high-risk state. The rigorous 90% screening mandate will significantly reduce the 'hidden' infectious population entering Arizona, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. Therefore, I recommend restricting inbound traffic from Mississippi for the next 14 days."

According to the 'Source Risk Profile,' mississippi's infectious density is relatively higher compared to other origin states, with (E+I)/Population = 0.0769, indicating a higher potential for disease importation. The 'Detection Utility' of this policy is expected to be high, capturing and converting a significant number of 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) from mississippi, thus reducing the risk of disease spread in arizona. This targeted approach is chosen over other origin states as it addresses a more prominent source of risk, 'Coordination vs. Competition,' without compromising the overall effectiveness of the policy. By implementing this policy, we can minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in arizona while considering the systemic risks of disease importation."
