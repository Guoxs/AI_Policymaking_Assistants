  "global_guidance": "Based on the given SEIRD parameters and population compositions, I decided to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy targeting Texas as the origin state. This choice is driven by the Source Risk Profile: Texas has a relatively high Infectious Density (E+I)/Population with 927 Exposed and 327 Infected individuals. Additionally, Texas has a significant inbound flow into Virginia, which increases the risk of disease importation. The Detection Utility of the screening is estimated to capture a substantial number of Hidden Infections, as the rigorous ninety percent screening mandate will effectively identify and move individuals from the Exposed (E) and Infected (I) compartments directly into the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival. By targeting Texas, I am addressing a significant source of risk and filling a gap in regional defense. The selection of Texas over other origin states is justified by its high Infectious Density and significant inbound flow into Virginia, making it a more critical target for control efforts."

First, I evaluate the 'Infectious Density' (E+I)/Population of each origin.  Arizona has the highest 'Infectious Density' of 0.0064, followed by Mississippi with 0.0062, New Mexico with 0.0015, and Texas with 0.00095.  This suggests that Arizona is the most likely source of new infections.  Second, I estimate the 'Detection Utility' of the screening, which is 90% of the 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) that will be captured and converted to Q-status.  This is a significant reduction in the 'hidden' infectious population entering the community.  Finally, I consider 'Coordination vs. Competition'.  Targeting the obvious high-risk state, Arizona, may overlap with other agents' decisions, but it is the most effective way to reduce the risk of disease importation in Virginia, given the current epidemiological situation.
