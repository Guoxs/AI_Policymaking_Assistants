Arizona's $(E+I)/Population$ stands out at 0.000267, significantly higher than the other states. This suggests that Arizona is a primary source of infection. The 'Detection Utility' of our targeted screening policy is substantial, as it can capture and convert up to 95% of 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) into Q-status upon arrival in New Mexico. In coordination with other agents, we choose to target Arizona, the most obvious high-risk state, to fill a critical gap in regional defense, effectively reducing the 'Hidden Infection' pool and minimizing the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico."

With 19659 new infected cases over the past 21 days, Texas has the highest proportion of infected individuals among all origin states. Our Targeted Inbound Screening policy will effectively capture and convert a significant portion of these 'Hidden Infections' to Q-status upon arrival in New Mexico, thereby reducing the risk of disease spread. The high inbound flow from Texas to New Mexico also justifies this targeted approach, as it fills a gap in regional defense.
