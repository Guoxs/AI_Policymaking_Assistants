In coordination with the existing mobility baselines, targeting mississippi as the origin state for enhanced screening will help minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in texas while considering the systemic risks of disease importation. Additionally, mississippi's relatively lower inflow compared to other origin states, such as virginia, justifies the selection of this state as a secondary source to fill a gap in regional defense."

This decision balances the risk of disease importation with the potential impact on the state's economy and society. The Source Risk Profile of Mississippi, with an average past 21-day population composition of 1.14% infected individuals, suggests a higher likelihood of disease transmission.

With an infectious density (E+I)/Population of approximately 0.013, Mississippi shows a higher risk profile compared to other origin states. The detection utility of the targeted screening is estimated to capture and convert a significant number of 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) to Q-status. Furthermore, this decision aims to fill a gap in regional defense, as Mississippi's past 14-day averages of S, E, I, Q, R, and D indicate a moderate to high level of disease activity. By implementing a targeted screening policy for Mississippi, we can effectively reduce the 'hidden' infectious population entering Texas, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in the state while considering the systemic risks of disease importation."

  "global_guidance": "Considering the Infectious Density of each origin state, I prioritize arizona as the most critical source to target. Arizona's high E+I population (81460 + 5250 = 96710) translates to an 'Infectious Density' of approximately 0.107%. In contrast, the other origin states' Infectious Densities are significantly lower. By targeting arizona, we expect a substantial 'Detection Utility' of 90% screening, which would capture and convert many 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) into Q-status. This strategy minimizes the risk of importing infectious individuals into texas, thereby reducing the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in the state. This decision is justified as a 'Coordination' effort, focusing on the obvious high-risk state, rather than competing for resources with other origin states."
