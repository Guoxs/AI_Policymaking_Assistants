Implementing a Targeted Inbound Screening policy for Texas will effectively identify and move individuals from the Exposed (E) and Infected (I) compartments directly into the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival, thereby significantly reducing the 'hidden' infectious population entering our community. This decision is justified by the source risk profile, which suggests that Texas presents a higher risk of disease importation. The detection utility of this targeted screening is substantial, as it will capture and convert a considerable number of 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) to Q-status. Furthermore, targeting Texas fills a significant gap in regional defense, as it is a major source of inbound flow into virginia, making this policy a crucial step in minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in the state while considering the systemic risks of disease importation."

The detection utility of targeted screening is substantial, as it can capture and convert a substantial number of 'hidden infections' (E and I) into Q-status.

Arizona and new mexico have relatively low infectious densities, while mississippi has a moderate to high infectious density. Texas has the highest infectious density. However, I prioritize mississippi as the target state due to its relatively higher average daily inbound flow into virginia. This decision aims to capture and convert more 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) into Q-status via the screening process. Considering the systemic risks of disease importation, I believe this targeted screening policy will help minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in virginia over the next two weeks."

Mississippi's past 14-day averages show a significant amount of E and I compartments, indicating a higher risk of disease importation into Virginia. By targeting Mississippi, we can detect and convert a substantial number of 'Hidden Infections' to Q-status, thereby reducing the number of undetected infectious individuals entering Virginia.
