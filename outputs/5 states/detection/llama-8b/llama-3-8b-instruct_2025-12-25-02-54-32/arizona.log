  "global_guidance": "For the next 14-day horizon, I recommend implementing a Targeted Inbound Screening policy targeting Mississippi as the origin state. The infectious density of Mississippi is higher compared to other origin states, with an average of 0.55% (E+I)/Population over the past 21 days. This suggests a higher risk of disease importation.

The detection utility of the screening is substantial, as it will effectively capture and convert a significant portion of the 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) into Q-status, reducing the 'hidden' infectious population entering Arizona. Additionally, screening at the border will provide an early warning system to detect and respond to potential outbreaks.

Coordinating with other agents to target the obvious high-risk state (Mississippi) helps to fill a gap in regional defense and reduces the risk of disease spread. This policy is expected to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona while considering the systemic risks of disease importation."

The 'Infectious Density' of Mississippi is $(28160+13440)/2118243 = 0.0446$, which is higher than other origin states. This suggests that Mississippi has a higher risk of disease importation. The 'Detection Utility' of this policy is estimated to capture and convert $(0.9*28160+0.9*13440)/8520155 \approx 0.0323$ of the 'Hidden Infections' in Arizona, which is a significant reduction in the 'hidden' infectious population. Meanwhile, the baseline inbound flow from Mississippi is relatively high, making it a prime target for enhanced screening. By targeting Mississippi, we can effectively reduce the number of new 'Hidden Infections' entering Arizona, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in the state. This policy is a coordinated effort to address the regional risk of disease spread, rather than competing with other agents to control different sources of importation."

For the next 2-week horizon, I select Mississippi as the origin state due to its high 'Infectious Density' $(E+I)/Population$ of 0.0774, which is significantly higher than the other origin states. This screening will effectively identify and move individuals from the Exposed (E) and Infected (I) compartments directly into the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival, reducing the 'hidden' infectious population entering the community. This decision also minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona while considering the systemic risks of disease importation. In particular, Mississippi's high E and I populations, combined with its large daily inbound flow, make it an attractive target for screening. By targeting Mississippi, we will capture and convert a significant number of 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) to Q-status, thereby reducing the spread of the disease. This decision balances coordination with other agents and competition for resources, as it addresses a significant source of risk while leaving room for other agents to address their own

With an infectious density of 0.0154, mississippi has a higher likelihood of generating hidden infections.

The ninety percent screening mandate will identify and move individuals from the Exposed (E) and Infected (I) compartments directly into the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival. This significant reduction in 'hidden' infectious population entering arizona will help minimize disease spread and prevent further outbreaks.

By focusing on mississippi, we optimize our regional defense strategy while acknowledging the systemic risks of disease importation."
