Among the origin states, Mississippi presents the highest 'Infectious Density' (E+I)/Population, which indicates a higher risk of disease spread. The 'Detection Utility' of the targeted screening policy is estimated to capture and convert a significant number of 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) into Q-status, thereby reducing the transmission risk. Considering the regional context, targeting Mississippi can be seen as a strategic move to fill a gap in regional defense, as it is not as heavily scrutinized as other high-risk states like Texas. By implementing a targeted inbound screening policy for Mississippi, Virginia can effectively reduce the risk of disease importation and minimize the spread of the disease within the state."

  "global_guidance": "For the next 14-day horizon, I recommend implementing a Targeted Inbound Screening policy targeting Mississippi as the origin state. This decision is based on the following reasoning: Firstly, I evaluated the 'Infectious Density' of each origin state, which is the ratio of Exposed (E) and Infected (I) individuals to the population. Mississippi has the highest Infectious Density among the four origin states, with a value of (34160+16340)/1738574 = 0.0244. This indicates that Mississippi is a significant source of potential infections. Secondly, I estimated the 'Detection Utility' of the screening policy. By targeting Mississippi, I expect to capture approximately 0.0244 * 6789 = 165 people who would have otherwise entered Virginia without being detected, based on the average daily inflow from Mississippi into Virginia. This is a substantial reduction in the number of 'Hidden Infections'. Finally, I considered the 'Coordination vs. Competition' aspect. As Virginia has already implemented screening measures, targeting Mississippi provides a clear secondary source of defense, rather than competing with other states for limited resources.
