  "global_guidance": "Based on the given information, I recommend implementing a Targeted Inbound Screening policy that restricts inbound traffic from Arizona. Arizona has the highest Infectious Density (E+I)/Population among all origin states, with a value of 0.0152. This indicates a higher risk of disease importation.

The Detection Utility of this policy will be significant, as Arizona has a relatively high number of exposed and infected individuals (E=12410, I=796) who could be identified and moved into the Confirmed (Q) compartment through rigorous screening. This will help reduce the 'hidden' infectious population entering Texas.

Additionally, Arizona's inbound flow into Texas is relatively high (12691405), making it a significant source of potential infections. By restricting traffic from Arizona, we can reduce the number of people potentially carrying the disease and minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas. The policy duration is fixed at 14 days, which will allow us to assess its effectiveness and make adjustments as needed."

Detection Utility is high, as the screening process will effectively identify and move individuals from the Exposed and Infected compartments directly into the Confirmed compartment upon arrival. This will significantly reduce the 'hidden' infectious population entering our community. Coordination vs. Competition: We target arizona as the obvious high-risk state, overlapping with other agents, to maximize the impact of the intervention. By restricting inbound traffic from arizona, we aim to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in texas while considering the systemic risks of disease importation."
