Arizona has the highest Infectious Density (E+I)/Population of 0.000734, which poses a significant risk to Mississippi. Additionally, Arizona has the highest number of past 14-day average daily inbound flow into Mississippi, which increases the likelihood of disease importation.

The Origin Risk Profile of Arizona indicates a higher probability of disease transmission, and the Detection Utility of the screening policy will likely capture and convert a substantial number of 'Hidden Infections' to Q-status. Furthermore, targeting Arizona fills a gap in regional defense by addressing a high-risk origin state, rather than simply targeting the most obvious high-risk state, which may already be being addressed by other agents."

Based on the Infectious Density $(E+I)/Population$ of each origin state, I have identified Texas as the highest-risk state.

The Detection Utility of the screening policy is estimated to capture and convert a significant number of 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) to Q-status, thereby reducing the number of cases entering Mississippi. In this scenario, I have chosen to implement a Targeted Inbound Screening policy on Texas, as it is the obvious high-risk state and implementing screening on this state will have the greatest impact on reducing disease spread. The policy will be in effect for the next 14 days. By targeting Texas, we can effectively reduce the 'hidden' infectious population entering Mississippi and minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in the state."
