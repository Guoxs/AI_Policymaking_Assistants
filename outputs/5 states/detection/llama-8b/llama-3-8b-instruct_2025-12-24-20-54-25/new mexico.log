This is due to its low proportion of Exposed (E) and Infected (I) individuals. However, considering the Detection Utility of the screening policy, we expect to capture and convert a significant number of 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) into Confirmed (Q) status. This will help reduce the 'hidden' infectious population entering our community. By targeting Texas, we are addressing a secondary source of disease importation, filling a gap in regional defense, and minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico. The coordination of efforts with other agents would be less effective in this scenario, as Texas is not the most obvious high-risk state, and focusing on it would not have a significant impact on the overall epidemic dynamics."

Arizona has the highest 'Infectious Density' among the given origin states, with $(12410+796)/8303030$ 「 0.0152. Mississippi has the second-highest density, with $(28153+13434)/2118351$ 「 0.0144. Texas and Virginia have significantly lower densities. We choose to target Arizona because it is the origin state with the highest infectious density, and thus has the greatest potential to import infections into New Mexico. This decision also considers the 'Detection Utility' of the screening policy. By targeting Arizona, we expect to capture and convert a significant number of 'Hidden Infections' into Q-status. The 'Coordination vs. Competition' aspect is also considered. Since Arizona is a neighboring state and has a high inbound flow to New Mexico, targeting it fills a gap in regional defense and prevents potential competition with other origin states.

  "global_guidance": "As the agent for New Mexico, I am recommending a targeted inbound screening policy for the next 2 weeks, focusing on Arizona as the origin state. The reasoning behind this decision is as follows: Source Risk Profile: Arizona has the highest 'Infectious Density' $(E+I)/Population$ of all origin states, with an average of 2.51% of its population in the Exposed (E) and Infected (I) compartments over the past 21 days. This suggests that Arizona is a high-risk origin state. Detection Utility: The rigorous screening and detection process for travelers from Arizona will effectively identify and move individuals from the Exposed (E) and Infected (I) compartments directly into the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival, thereby reducing the 'hidden' infectious population entering our community. Coordination vs. Competition: By targeting Arizona, we are addressing the most significant source of incoming infections, rather than spreading our efforts across multiple origin states, which could lead to a decrease in overall effectiveness. This targeted approach will help minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico while considering the systemic risks of disease importation."

The detection utility of the screening policy is also substantial, as it is likely to capture a significant number of 'Hidden Infections' in arizona. By targeting arizona, we can effectively reduce the number of new infections entering new mexico, thereby slowing the spread of the disease. This decision is supported by our evaluation of the Source Risk Profile and Detection Utility, and we believe it is the most effective way to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in new mexico while considering the systemic risks of disease importation. Additionally, our Coordination vs. Competition analysis suggests that targeting arizona fills a gap in regional defense, as it is a high-risk state that is not being targeted by other agents.
