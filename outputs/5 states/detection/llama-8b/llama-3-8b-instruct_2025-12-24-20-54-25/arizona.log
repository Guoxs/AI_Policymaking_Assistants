With an infectious density of $(28153+13434)/2118351\approx 0.0171$, Mississippi's past 14-day averages indicate a significant number of 'hidden' infections entering Arizona.

This is significantly higher than the other origin states, with new mexico being the next highest at 0.0126%. The detection utility of this policy is estimated to be 443 hidden infections captured and converted to Q-status via the screening, which is substantial considering the current E and I compartments in mississippi. By targeting mississippi, we are filling a gap in regional defense, as new mexico has been relatively low-risk in recent weeks. Additionally, mississippi's inbound flow to arizona is substantial, making this an attractive target for reducing the risk of disease importation. Overall, this policy is expected to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in arizona."

The Infectious Density (E+I)/Population of Mississippi is higher compared to the other origin states, which increases the risk of disease importation. The Detection Utility of the screening policy is high, as it will effectively identify and convert a significant number of 'Hidden Infections' (E and I) into Q-status, reducing the number of cases entering Arizona. Furthermore, targeting Mississippi fills a gap in regional defense, as it is a secondary source that may not be immediately obvious as a high-risk state. By implementing this policy, we can minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona while considering the systemic risks of disease importation."

  "global_guidance": "Selecting mississippi as the origin state for targeted inbound screening is justified due to its high 'Infectious Density' $(E+I)/Population$ of 0.1454. This is significantly higher than the other origin states. The rigorous ninety percent screening mandate will effectively identify and move individuals from the Exposed (E) and Infected (I) compartments directly into the Confirmed (Q) compartment upon arrival, significantly reducing the 'hidden' infectious population entering our community. Additionally, as the 'Detection Utility' of this screening will be substantial, we can expect to capture and convert a large number of 'Hidden Infections' to Q-status. Despite the potential for overlap with other agents targeting high-risk states, we believe the benefits of this targeted approach outweigh the costs, and it is a crucial step in minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in arizona while considering the systemic risks of disease importation."
