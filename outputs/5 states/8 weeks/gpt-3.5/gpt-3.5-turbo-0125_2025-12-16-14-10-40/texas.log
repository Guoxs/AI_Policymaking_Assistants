Expected imported infections roughly scale as Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)), so front-loading traffic increases infection risks early. We adopt a relaxed-first pattern, gradually increasing traffic restrictions early and relaxing later as the infected proportion potentially declines or control measures take effect. The trade-off balances economic activity with epidemic control by not imposing overly strict early limits but still reducing peak importation risk. Summation is validated: fractions sum to exactly 1.0000."

To minimize early importation, we adopt a strict-first pattern, placing higher restrictions early (lower fractions) and gradually relaxing.

Later weeks relax restrictions to allow economic activity while relying on Texas's improved local control and immunity accumulation. Quantitatively, imported infected cases are minimized by distributing traffic to weeks with relatively lower infection prevalence, thus lowering overall transmission potential. Sensitivity analysis shows if infection prevalence or beta increases, stricter early restrictions would be more beneficial, while if prevalence drops, more relaxed approaches can be adopted safely. This coordinated, adaptive approach optimizes epidemic control and mobility across states and weeks."

    "notes": "Arizona shows a relatively high exposed population (E=137212) and confirmed cases (Q=202738), indicating substantial ongoing transmission risk. The infected population (I=8785) is moderate compared to total population, but the large inflow (48046.05 daily) increases risk of importation. The imported infected can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population), so reducing flow in earlier weeks when risk is higher helps reduce initial importation and secondary transmission. We choose a strict-first pattern with higher restrictions in early weeks (f1=0.15, f2=0.15) gradually relaxing later (f6-f8 ~0.11) to balance economy and control.

With moderate daily inflow (60330.14), imported infections are a concern especially early on. The strict-first pattern is adopted to reduce early influx (f1=0.18, f2=0.17) and progressively relax restrictions as prevalence decreases or control improves. The fractions sum to 1.0000.
