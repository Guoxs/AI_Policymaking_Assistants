    "notes": "Arizona has a high susceptible population but moderate infected (I=3717) relative to its population ~9 million. The imported infected can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / total population). Given the steady infection levels, we adopt a slight strict-first pattern, reducing flow in earlier weeks (weeks 1-4) to prevent seeding infections in Virginia when local infections are still notable. Later weeks are slightly relaxed as prevalence stabilizes. Trade-offs balance limiting imported infections early versus economic mobility. The fractions sum to exactly 1, ensuring total inbound flow matches ground truth."

We adopt a mostly even pattern with a slight relaxation in mid period (weeks 3-5) to balance economic needs and control. Early and late weeks have marginally stricter controls to reduce seeding potential in Virginia. This pattern optimizes minimizing imported cases and deaths while sustaining mobility. Fractions sum exactly to 1."
  },
  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocation across states is designed to minimize Virginia's cumulative infections and deaths by balancing imported infection risk and mobility needs. High prevalence origin states (Mississippi, Texas) have stricter controls early or even distribution to reduce seeding potential during vulnerable weeks. Lower prevalence states (New Mexico) have relatively even allocations to preserve mobility. By adjusting weekly fractions but keeping total inflow constant, the policy reduces peak imported infections and smooths epidemic pressure. This cooperative approach leverages temporal and spatial risk differences, prioritizing early containment when local susceptible and infected numbers in Virginia are still high. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if transmission rates (beta) or infection prevalence increase, stricter early restrictions would be more beneficial, while if prevalence drops, more relaxed allocations could be safely adopted. Overall, the strategy balances epidemic control and economic mobility across states and weeks."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the allocation applies a stricter inbound traffic control in early weeks from higher-risk states (Arizona, Mississippi, Texas) to reduce immediate imported infections, which is critical to limiting Virginia's epidemic growth. New Mexico, with lower infection risk, maintains a more even traffic pattern to preserve mobility. The allocations balance disease control and economic impact by gradually relaxing controls as local conditions improve and susceptible populations decrease. Quantitatively, the expected imported infected cases are proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population); lowering ft in early weeks for higher-risk states reduces initial seeding of infections. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if beta (transmission rate) increases, stricter early controls become even more important. Conversely, if infection prevalence in origin states decreases, traffic can be more evenly distributed, enhancing mobility without compromising control.
