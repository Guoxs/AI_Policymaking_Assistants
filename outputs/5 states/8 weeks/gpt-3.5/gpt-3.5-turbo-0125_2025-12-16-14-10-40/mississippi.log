    "notes": "Arizona has a moderate exposed (E=57831) but relatively low infected (I=3717) population compared to its total. The risk of importing infected individuals is roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)), so steady moderate control is effective. The pattern chosen is slightly strict-first, reducing flow early (weeks 1-4) to preempt potential imported infections while allowing slightly relaxed flow later as infections stabilize. This balances disease control with economic mobility needs. The sum of fractions equals 1.00 exactly, ensuring total flow is preserved."

We adopt a relaxed-first pattern, allowing higher flows early (weeks 1-3) while gradually tightening late (weeks 7-8) to avoid late-stage importation risks. The expected imported infected is Flow*ft*(I/population), so this pattern balances low risk with some early mobility. The fractions sum to 1.00 exactly."

The imported infected risk is high, so a strict-first pattern is chosen: tight controls early to suppress initial imported infections, then gradual relaxation in later weeks as local control improves. This pattern helps delay peak imported infections and reduces overall burden. Fractions sum to 1.00 exactly."

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy balances epidemic control and mobility by adjusting weekly inbound flows based on each origin state's infection prevalence. States with higher infected populations (Texas) have stricter controls earlier, minimizing immediate imported infections. States with lower infection rates (New Mexico) have more relaxed early flows, allowing economic activity. The weekly fractions sum to 1 for each state, preserving total mobility volume. By spreading restrictions unevenly over time, we reduce peak importation risks and help flatten the epidemic curve in Mississippi. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early-week reductions are more impactful. Cooperation across states in timing flow relaxation avoids synchronized importation waves, lowering cumulative cases and deaths in Mississippi."

    "notes": "Arizona has a large susceptible population with moderate exposed and infected cases. The infected-to-population ratio is low but non-negligible, resulting in moderate importation risk proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population). Given this, a strict-first pattern is chosen, concentrating stricter controls in the early weeks (lower fractions) to reduce initial importation pressure and gradually relaxing later. This balances epidemic control by reducing early seeding of infections and allows some mobility restoration later. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000, ensuring flow conservation."

The imported infected estimation using Flow*ft*(I/population) suggests moderate risk initially.

To mitigate early seeding, strict controls are applied in the first four weeks (lower fractions) followed by relaxed controls later (higher fractions), a strict-first pattern. This approach reduces cumulative infections and deaths by cutting initial imported cases while balancing economic and social mobility needs in later weeks. Fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

    "notes": "Virginia has moderate infected and exposed levels relative to population and inbound flow. The imported infected risk is moderate and fairly stable. A nearly even pattern with slightly stricter control in mid-weeks is selected to balance risk and mobility, consistent with a slight strict-first approach. This helps smooth importation pressure avoiding spikes while maintaining flow conservation. Fractions sum exactly to 1.000."
  },
  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocations focus on reducing early importation of infections from all origin states, especially those with higher infected prevalence and flow such as Texas and Arizona. The strict-first pattern for high-risk states lowers initial imported infections, decreasing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Mississippi. For states with lower prevalence or flow, more even or mildly strict patterns preserve mobility while controlling risk. This cross-state balancing leverages temporal risk trends to minimize overall imported infections and deaths. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become even more critical, while reductions in prevalence allow for more relaxed flow. This cooperative allocation strategy optimally distributes inbound flow over 8 weeks maintaining total volume but reducing epidemic pressure on Mississippi."
