    "notes": "Mississippi shows relatively high exposed (E=24024) and infected (I=10448) proportions compared to its population (~6.5 million). The risk of importing infected individuals is proportional to inbound flow times infected ratio (I/population). Given the high infection prevalence, a strict-first pattern is chosen to reduce early-week inflow, decreasing immediate importation risk and allowing Arizona to prepare. The fractions start lower (0.10) and gradually increase to 0.13 to balance mobility needs later. Trade-offs include temporary mobility restrictions vs. epidemic control, aiming to minimize cumulative infections and deaths in Arizona. The fractions sum exactly to 1."

Although its flow into Arizona is large, the infection risk per traveler is lower. We adopt a mostly even pattern with slight reduction in the last week (0.06) to anticipate any late surges and balance flow. This distribution smooths traffic while maintaining control. The expected imported infections scale with flow times infected ratio; thus, small fluctuations have modest impact. The fractions sum exactly to 1."

We apply a strict-first pattern with stricter control in early weeks (0.09-0.11) to reduce initial importation risk, then gradually relax control as prevalence is expected to decrease or as Arizona adapts.

This smooth approach limits sudden spikes in imported infections. Imported infected scale with flow times infected ratio. The fractions sum exactly to 1."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocations reduce expected imported infections and deaths by imposing stricter controls in early weeks for states with higher prevalence and large flows (Mississippi, Texas), while allowing more balanced flows from lower-risk origins (New Mexico, Virginia). This distribution balances risks by shifting traffic away from weeks of peak infection pressure, aiming to flatten the importation curve. The quantitative logic uses infection pressure (I/population) times flow and fraction per week to estimate imported infections, assigning lower fractions to weeks with higher expected risk. Sensitivity to prevalence means if infected counts rise, stricter early-week controls would be reinforced; if beta changes, timing of peak infection risk shifts, requiring dynamic adjustment. This policy supports Arizona's epidemic control by minimizing imported cases while sustaining essential mobility."

Imported infected can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/population), thus concentrating flow early weeks risks higher importation. Given steady infection levels, we apply a strict-first pattern with lower fractions in later weeks to reduce risk gradually while balancing mobility needs. Early weeks have moderate restrictions (fractions 0.15) and later weeks stricter (0.1) to minimize cumulative imported infections. The sum of fractions is exactly 1, meeting constraints."

  "global_guidance": "The allocation strategy balances inbound traffic from all origin states to minimize cumulative infections and deaths in Arizona. States with higher infection prevalence (Mississippi, Texas) have stricter early or late controls to reduce imported infections, while states with lower prevalence (New Mexico) have more relaxed early flow to support mobility. This cross-state balancing distributes risk over time, preventing surges in imported infections and allowing Arizona's healthcare to manage cases. Quantitatively, imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/population), so varying ft weekly controls risk temporally. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection rates or beta increase, stricter controls earlier would be necessary to avoid overwhelming local capacity. Conversely, if prevalence falls, more relaxed patterns can be adopted. Overall, this cooperative policy reduces Arizona's epidemic burden while maintaining essential mobility."
