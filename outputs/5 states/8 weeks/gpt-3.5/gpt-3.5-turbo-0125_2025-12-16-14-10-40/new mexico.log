    "notes": "Arizona has a moderately high number of exposed (57831) and infected (3717) individuals relative to its population, indicating a significant infection pressure. Expected imported infections are roughly proportional to Flow * ft * (I/population), where I/population is around 0.00041. To minimize risk, stricter controls are applied early (weeks 1-3) with lower fractions (0.08) to reduce initial importation, then gradually relaxed as prevalence stabilizes. This strict-first pattern helps prevent early seeding of infections while balancing mobility needs later. The fractions sum exactly to 1.0, ensuring total flow is maintained with timing adjustments."

The inbound flow is low (1534.76), so impact of strict controls is moderate. We choose an even pattern with slight relaxation in last two weeks to balance control and mobility. This approach minimizes importation risk while maintaining some flow consistency. Fractions sum exactly to 1.0 as required."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic allocations across origin states prioritize early strict controls for states with higher infection prevalence and larger flows (Texas, Arizona), employing a strict-first pattern to minimize early seeding of infections in New Mexico. For states with smaller flows or lower prevalence (Mississippi, Virginia), the approach is moderate strictness early with gradual relaxation to maintain essential mobility. Collectively, this staggered, risk-weighted strategy reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths by lowering infection pressure during high-risk early periods while balancing economic and social needs. The sum-to-one constraint ensures total inbound traffic remains stable; reallocation over weeks is the lever to optimize epidemic control. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, even stricter early controls would be warranted, whereas lower prevalence could allow more relaxed flows. These policies dynamically balance epidemic risk with mobility to protect New Mexico's population."

    "notes": "Arizona shows a moderate infected population (I=8785) with a substantial exposed count (E=137212), indicating ongoing transmission risk. Given the large susceptible population (S=8,420,475), the infected proportion is relatively low but non-negligible. Expected imported infections roughly scale with Flow * ft * (I / population), implying weeks with higher fractions increase risk. To minimize introductions, a strict-first pattern is applied: stricter control (lower fractions) early to delay and reduce seeding, relaxing later as local controls and immunity improve. Trade-offs include economic mobility versus infection control; front-loading restrictions reduce cumulative cases by limiting early seeding. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000, validating allocation."
