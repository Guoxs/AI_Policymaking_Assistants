    "notes": "Arizona has a large susceptible population but significant exposed (E=60027) and infected (I=3878) cases, indicating moderate infection pressure. Imported infected individuals can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/Population), so controlling weeks with higher infections is key. The infection trend appears relatively stable, so a relaxed-first pattern with slightly increasing flow early helps balance control and mobility, allowing initial lower restrictions and gradually maintaining flows. This approach mitigates importation risk by spreading inflow, while not overly restricting traffic initially, considering Arizona's large flow. The fractions sum exactly to 1.0000, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocation collectively prioritizes early restrictions on states with higher infection prevalence (mississippi, virginia) to reduce imported infections into New Mexico when local epidemic is vulnerable (E=7506, I=1742). States with large flows but moderate infection pressure (arizona, texas) have more balanced or relaxed-first patterns to maintain mobility without excessive risk. The total daily inbound flow per origin is conserved by ensuring fractions sum to 1, and weekly distribution is adjusted to flatten infection importation peaks. This cooperation balances cross-state epidemic pressures and preserves economic activity. Sensitivity to parameters like beta (transmission rate) means stricter early control would benefit if transmission increases. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, controls can relax earlier. This adaptive allocation aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in New Mexico by strategically timing inbound traffic to lower infection importation risk."

    "notes": "Arizona has a large susceptible population but also a significant exposed (E=141634) and infected (I=9056) population, indicating moderate infection pressure. Imported infections can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)), so higher traffic fractions during weeks of high infection prevalence increase risk. The infection pressure seems to be steady, so a gradual relaxation pattern is chosen: strict-first, progressively relaxing traffic controls over weeks. Early weeks have stricter controls to limit importation when risk is higher, then gradually relax to balance mobility needs. This trade-off reduces new infections while maintaining essential movement. The fractions sum to exactly 1.0000, validating the allocation."

    "notes": "Mississippi has a smaller susceptible pool but very high exposed (E=53970) and infected (I=21259) relative to population, indicating high infection risk. Imported infections relate to Flow*ft*(I/population). Because of high infection pressure, stricter controls at start weeks are prudent, with gradual relaxation as the epidemic potentially stabilizes or due to mobility demands. This 'strict-first' pattern reduces early seeding risks. The trade-off balances epidemic control with mobility needs, especially given the low baseline flow here. Fractions sum exactly to 1.0000, ensuring valid allocation."

The absolute infected count is notable due to population size, so imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/population). Infection pressure appears relatively stable without extreme peaks. An 'even' distribution is chosen to maintain consistent traffic, avoiding spikes that may cause outbreaks while allowing steady mobility. This approach balances epidemic risk and economic activity.

    "notes": "Virginia shows moderate infection pressure with exposed (E=114266) and infected (I=27254) indicating some risk. Traffic allocation uses a 'strict-first' approach with slightly higher restrictions early to curb importation risk, then gradual relaxation. This pattern mitigates importation during peak risk periods while accommodating mobility needs later. The trade-off considers the relatively low baseline flow from Virginia, so moderate controls suffice. The fractions sum exactly to 1.0000, ensuring compliance."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocations from all origin states prioritize early-stage strict controls ('strict-first' patterns) for states with high infection prevalence (Mississippi, Arizona, Virginia) to reduce initial importation risk into New Mexico, which has moderate infections. Texas, with a very large population and steady infection prevalence, receives an 'even' distribution to maintain stable flow without spikes. This staggered control across weeks balances epidemic control and economic mobility, effectively minimizing expected new infections and deaths by reducing high-risk flows when infection pressure is greatest. The total flows remain constant for each origin state, respecting mobility needs while adjusting weekly proportions for epidemic control. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls should be intensified; if prevalence decreases, controls can be relaxed sooner. This coordinated approach across states and weeks leverages temporal infection trends and population risk profiles to optimize control policies."
