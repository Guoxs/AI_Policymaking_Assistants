    "notes": "Mississippi shows a relatively high prevalence of infected (I=15725) and exposed (E=34770) relative to its population (~6.5 million), indicating a significant importation risk. The imported infected can be approximated by Flow*ft*(I/population), suggesting that reducing flow fractions in earlier weeks when Arizona's epidemic status is vulnerable can slow seeding. We choose a strict-first pattern, front-loading stricter controls (lower fractions) in later weeks and relaxing initially to spread the flow somewhat, because the epidemic in Mississippi appears moderately high and sustained. This approach balances epidemic control by reducing peak imported infections early and gradually relaxing mobility to not overly harm travel. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

Thus, the imported infection risk is lower per flow unit. The allocation favors a relaxed-first pattern, with lower control (higher fractions) in later weeks as the epidemic risk is lower, but some moderate early restrictions to prevent seeding. This balances allowing mobility while controlling risk. The fractions sum precisely to 1.000."

    "notes": "Texas has a large population and high infected count (I=22354) and exposed (E=13397), posing a substantial importation risk. The imported infected is roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), so a somewhat even distribution with mild relaxation towards mid weeks is chosen to avoid sharp spikes in imported infections. This even pattern mitigates risk over the entire period, balancing epidemic control and economic mobility. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

A strict-first pattern is used, with stricter control in later weeks to prevent late surges of imported infections as Arizona's epidemic evolves. Early weeks have moderate flow to maintain essential mobility. Trade-offs balance risk reduction with mobility needs. Fractions sum to 1.000 exactly."
  },
  "global_guidance": "Collectively, these inbound allocations prioritize reducing imported infections from states with higher infection prevalence (Mississippi, Texas, Virginia) by applying stricter controls early or across the period, thereby lowering seeding risk in Arizona. States like New Mexico with lower infection prevalence receive relatively relaxed controls to maintain essential mobility. The 8-week fraction patterns are designed to smooth imported infection pressure over time, reducing peaks that could overwhelm Arizona's control measures. Quantitatively, this approach balances Flow*ft*(I/population) terms across states and weeks, minimizing cumulative infections and deaths. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or beta increases, stricter early controls should be intensified, while lower prevalence allows more relaxed policies. Cross-state cooperation ensures Arizona receives reduced infection importation without excessive mobility disruption."

    "notes": "Mississippi presents relatively high exposed (E) and infected (I) counts compared to its population, indicating significant infection pressure. The expected imported infections can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/population), where I/population is elevated. Hence, stricter control in earlier weeks (lower fractions) helps reduce early introduction of infections into Arizona. The pattern chosen is strict-first, gradually relaxing traffic to balance mobility needs while minimizing risk. This phased approach mitigates early seeding of infections when local Arizona prevalence is still high. The fractions sum to exactly 1 (within 4 decimals), ensuring the total expected inflow remains constant."

The infection pressure is moderate, so a slightly relaxed-first pattern is applied, allowing more flow in later weeks when Arizona's local control might improve. Expected imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/population), and early restrictions reduce initial seeding. Balancing mobility and control, we gradually increase fractions to support economic activity. The fractions add to exactly 1, respecting total flow constraints."

The imported infections follow Flow*ft*(I/population). Given Texas's size, a relaxed-first pattern is chosen to allow gradual increase in traffic as Arizona's control measures stabilize. This pattern balances economic and social mobility needs while controlling early infection importation. The fractions are validated to sum to 1 exactly."

Using the formula Flow*ft*(I/population), early weeks with stricter control can significantly reduce imported infections. Thus, a strict-first pattern is employed, progressively relaxing control as weeks progress. This approach prioritizes epidemic risk reduction while cautiously restoring mobility. The fractions sum precisely to 1, maintaining constant total flow."
  },
  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocations collectively reduce expected imported infections and deaths in Arizona by applying stricter controls during early weeks when infection importation risk is highest, especially from states with higher infection prevalence like Mississippi and Virginia. Traffic from states with lower infection pressure, such as New Mexico and Texas, is allowed to increase gradually to balance epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs. Quantitatively, this phased approach distributes infection risk over time, preventing early seeding that could accelerate Arizona's local outbreak. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls would become even more critical to delay and reduce case spikes. Alternatively, if local control in Arizona improves faster, the fractions could shift toward slightly relaxed controls earlier to restore normalcy. Overall, this dynamic, state-specific allocation strategy optimizes epidemic mitigation while preserving necessary mobility."
