The expected imported infected cases scale as Flow*ft*(I/population), so keeping inbound flow more stable initially helps avoid sudden spikes.

  "global_guidance": "The proposed inbound flow allocations collectively aim to reduce imported infections into Virginia by dynamically adjusting weekly traffic controls based on origin state infection prevalence and inbound flow volumes. States with higher infection prevalence and flow volume (Texas, Mississippi) face stricter early restrictions to blunt the peak importation pressure, while lower-risk states (Arizona, New Mexico) maintain more stable or slightly relaxed patterns to preserve economic and social connectivity. This cooperative balance optimizes the overall risk of new infections and deaths in Virginia, smoothing epidemic waves and preventing healthcare overload. Sensitivity analysis shows that increasing transmission rate beta or prevalence in origin states would warrant more stringent early reductions, while lower parameters allow more relaxed controls. Adjusting weekly fractions rather than total flow preserves travel demand fairness. This targeted, temporally adaptive policy reduces cumulative cases and deaths effectively."

    "notes": "Arizona has a relatively high number of infected (9056) and exposed (141634) compared to its population (~11.6M total), indicating a moderate prevalence. The expected imported infections roughly scale as Flow * fraction * (I / population). To minimize importation risk, stricter controls are applied early (weeks 1-2), then gradually relaxed as prevalence may decline or control measures take effect. The chosen pattern is strict-first to reduce early seeding of infections in Virginia. This balances epidemic control and mobility by allowing some relaxation later when risk is lower, preserving economic activity. The fractions sum to exactly 1.00, ensuring total flow is maintained."

Given the large daily inflow (28069.71), early strict controls are essential to reduce imported infections (Flow * fraction * (I/population)). Hence, a strict-first pattern with low fractions in weeks 1-2 and gradual relaxation later is used to balance epidemic control while allowing mobility later. Fractions sum to 1.00 exactly."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocations prioritize early strict control for states with higher prevalence ratios and larger inflow volumes (Arizona, Mississippi, Texas), reducing early importation pressure that could seed outbreaks in Virginia. New Mexico, with low prevalence, has a more relaxed and even distribution to balance mobility and risk. By redistributing flow fractions across weeks but keeping total volumes constant, early epidemic seeding is minimized while preserving overall mobility. This cross-state approach balances risk and economic activity, considering state-specific infection pressures. Sensitivity analysis shows that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become even more critical, while if prevalence drops, a more even or relaxed pattern may suffice. Collective coordination across states reduces cumulative infections and deaths in Virginia by pacing inbound flow to avoid simultaneous high-risk importation peaks."
