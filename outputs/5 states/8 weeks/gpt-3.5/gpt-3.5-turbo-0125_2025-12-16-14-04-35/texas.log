  "global_guidance": "The overall inbound traffic control policy prioritizes early-week restrictions on flows from states with higher infected and exposed prevalence (Mississippi, Virginia, Arizona) to minimize early importation of infections into Texas, which has a significant susceptible population. Conversely, flows from New Mexico, with low prevalence, are relaxed initially to support mobility. This staggered approach balances epidemic control and social-economic mobility, minimizing cumulative infections and deaths in Texas. The weekly fractions for each state sum precisely to 1, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases in any origin state, stricter early-week restrictions will be even more crucial. This coordinated allocation across states and weeks reduces overlapping peaks of imported cases and allows Texas to manage healthcare capacity effectively."

    "notes": "Arizona shows a moderately high exposed (E=141634) and confirmed cases (Q=208204) with a relatively low infected (I=9056) compared to its population, indicating ongoing but somewhat controlled transmission. The imported infected estimate per week is approximately Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)), so delaying higher traffic to later weeks (weeks 5-8) reduces importation risk during peak infectious periods in Texas. The chosen pattern is relaxed-first with increasing fractions in later weeks to balance epidemic control and mobility, allowing initial stricter control to curb immediate risk. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (1.0000), ensuring traffic volume consistency."

    "notes": "Mississippi has a high exposed (E=53970) and infected (I=21259) ratio relative to its population, signaling significant epidemic pressure. To minimize imported infections (imported infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population)), stricter controls should be early to prevent seeding Texas' epidemic. Hence, the pattern is strict-first with higher restrictions in first 4 weeks and a slight relaxation afterward to maintain mobility. This trade-off balances controlling case importation while allowing gradual economic activity. The fractions sum precisely to 1 (1.0000), maintaining the total inbound flow."

    "notes": "New Mexico has a large susceptible population and relatively low infected cases (I=3524), indicating lower immediate risk for importing infections. The expected imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/population), which is low here. Hence, a relaxed-first pattern with increasing fractions over time is optimal, allowing more mobility initially and gradually increasing restrictions to preempt potential future surges. This balances economic and public health needs. Fractions sum exactly 1 (1.0000), preserving total flow."

    "notes": "Virginia has relatively high exposed (E=114266) and infected (I=27254) cases, posing notable infection importation risk. The imported infections ~ Flow*ft*(I/population) suggest early strict control is beneficial to reduce seeding in Texas. The pattern is strict-first, with higher restrictions in early weeks and gradual relaxation later to balance epidemic control and mobility. Fractions sum exactly 1 (1.0000), ensuring total inbound flow consistency."
  },
  "global_guidance": "The allocation strategy balances risks across origin states by imposing stricter controls during weeks when the risk of importation is higher, particularly focusing on states with higher infected and exposed populations like Mississippi and Virginia. By distributing traffic control dynamically over the 8 weeks, we flatten the potential imported infection curve, reducing peak seeding events in Texas. The quantitative cooperation logic considers each state's infected proportion and average flow to optimize timing of restrictions, thus minimizing cumulative infections and deaths in Texas. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, controls can be moderately relaxed without significant risk increase. Overall, this coordinated, dynamic control approach achieves epidemic mitigation while maintaining essential mobility."
