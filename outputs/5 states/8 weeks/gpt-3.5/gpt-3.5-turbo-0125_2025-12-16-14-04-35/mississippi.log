    "notes": "Arizona has a very large susceptible population but a relatively low infected proportion (I=3878 out of ~8.8M), indicating moderate risk of importing infections. Expected imported infections depend on flow*ft*(I/population), so frontloading strict controls reduces early introduction risks. We apply a strict-first pattern, with stricter control (lower fractions) in later weeks as the local epidemic may worsen, balancing mobility by easing early weeks slightly. The fractions sum exactly to 1.0, ensuring consistent inbound flow allocation."

The flow is smaller, so we adopt a slightly relaxed-first approach to allow some mobility early when risk is lower, then tighten mid-period to prevent possible increase in cases.

We use a strict-first pattern to reduce early importation risk, which is higher due to the high exposed and infected counts.

  "global_guidance": "The inbound allocations collectively prioritize reducing early importation risks from origin states with higher infected proportions and inflows, such as Texas and Virginia, by implementing stricter controls in initial weeks. Arizona and Virginia follow strict-first patterns due to moderate to high infection risk, while New Mexico uses a relaxed-first approach reflecting lower risk and smaller flows. Texas employs an even distribution to mitigate its large flow and infection count. This cross-state balancing strategically reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths by smoothing traffic to avoid surges. Sensitivity to prevalence and transmission rate beta is addressed by frontloading restrictions where infection pressure is greatest, thus allowing adaptive response if conditions worsen. These allocations ensure total flow remains consistent while optimizing timing of controls for epidemic suppression and mobility preservation."

The imported infected risk is proportional to Flow*f_t*(I/population), which is low but non-negligible. To minimize risk, we apply a slight strict-first pattern by reducing flows initially (f1=0.15, f2=0.14, f3=0.13) then gradually relaxing later weeks as infection pressure is likely stable or decreasing. This balances epidemic control with mobility needs. The sum of fractions is exactly 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "The collective allocation reduces expected imported infections by emphasizing stricter controls in earlier weeks for higher-risk states (Texas, Arizona) while allowing moderate flows from lower-risk states (New Mexico, Virginia). This balances infection importation pressure across weeks, flattening potential import spikes. Quantitatively, imported infections scale with Flow*f_t*(I/population), so reducing f_t early in high-I states lowers cumulative infections and deaths in Mississippi. The pattern also considers mobility needs by relaxing restrictions later. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if beta or prevalence increases, stricter early restrictions would gain importance. Conversely, if prevalence drops, allocations could be more relaxed. This coordinated approach minimizes epidemic risk while maintaining essential mobility."
