The imported infected estimate Flow*ft*(I/total_pop) implies a relatively high infection pressure. Thus, a strict-first approach is optimal, imposing heavier restrictions early (higher control, lower fractions) to minimize initial seeding into Virginia. Gradual relaxation is planned as local and inbound cases hopefully reduce. This approach balances epidemic control and mobility by prioritizing immediate risk reduction.

States with higher infection pressures, such as Mississippi and Texas, adopt strict-first patterns to reduce early importation risk, while states with lower infection prevalence, like New Mexico, follow relaxed-first patterns to sustain mobility. Arizona presents moderate risk and adopts a slightly front-loaded restriction pattern. The approach balances epidemic control and mobility by distributing restrictions temporally, avoiding long-term total flow reduction which could harm economic ties. Quantitatively, keeping total inflow constant but redistributing weekly fractions reduces peak importation risks and allows epidemic dynamics within Virginia to stabilize. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early controls become more critical; conversely, lower prevalence allows more relaxed initial inflows. This coordinated inter-state approach optimally manages importation risk and internal epidemic progression."

    "notes": "Arizona has a moderately high infected population (I=9229) relative to its total population, resulting in significant infection pressure. The imported infections roughly scale as Flow*ft*(I/total population). Given the average daily inflow of 5765.86, the expected infected arrivals are non-negligible. The fraction pattern is a 'strict-first' approach, applying stronger controls earlier (lower fractions) to suppress initial imported cases and allow Virginia's internal control to reduce prevalence before relaxing controls gradually. This balances epidemic control with maintaining some mobility. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000, ensuring total flow consistency."

Expected imported infections are proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population). A 'strict-first' pattern is used to reduce early-week flows to minimize immediate imported cases, preserving healthcare capacity in Virginia. As weeks progress and internal recovery increases, flow is relaxed slightly. This approach weighs infection risk against economic mobility and maintains the sum of fractions at 1."

With a smaller inflow (2314.43), the risk of imported cases is relatively moderate. An 'even' pattern is selected to maintain balanced mobility restrictions over the 8 weeks, as neither strict early control nor relaxation is strongly justified. This balances consistent epidemic control with mobility needs. The fractions sum precisely to 1.000."

    "notes": "Texas has a high infected count (I=28878) and a large inflow to Virginia (28069.71), indicating a high infection import risk. A 'relaxed-first' pattern is chosen, with stricter controls later, based on the assumption that initial weeks may have lower prevalence due to possible recent controls in Texas or to reduce socio-economic disruption early. Increasing fractions in later weeks gradually relax restrictions as Virginia's internal control improves, balancing epidemic control and mobility. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound allocations collectively reduce expected imported infections by applying stricter controls in weeks with the highest relative infection pressure from origin states, especially from Texas and Mississippi, which pose the highest risks due to large infected populations and high inflow volumes. Arizona and Mississippi employ more stringent restrictions early on to curb imported cases, while New Mexico maintains steady moderate controls reflecting its lower risk. Texas's pattern, slightly relaxed initially, assumes some external control or recent decline in prevalence, with stricter controls later to prevent resurgence. This strategy balances the need to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases while preserving essential mobility. Quantitatively, the policy distributes traffic to weeks with relatively lower infection import risk, leveraging the formula imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population). Sensitivity analysis shows that if transmission rates (beta) or infection prevalence rise, stricter early controls are even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, controls can be relaxed earlier. This cooperative balancing across states and weeks minimizes cumulative disease burden in Virginia while respecting mobility demands."
