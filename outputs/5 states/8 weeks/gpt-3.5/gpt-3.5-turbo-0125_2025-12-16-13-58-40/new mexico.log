The imported infected cases are risky if flow is high early on.

This trade-off delays some mobility but helps epidemic control. The fractions sum to 1 exactly."

We apply a strict-first pattern, enforcing lower flow fractions early (weeks 1-2) and gradually relaxing towards later weeks.

    "notes": "Virginia's infected and exposed counts are moderate relative to population. Here a strict-first pattern is used, with higher control early on (higher fractions in early weeks) tapering to lower fractions later. This minimizes importation during critical early periods. The fractions sum to 1 exactly, confirming validity."
  },
  "global_guidance": "Across all origin states, the allocation strategy prioritizes reducing early weeks' inbound flows from states with higher infection prevalence (especially Mississippi and Texas) to limit imported infections when New Mexico is most vulnerable. States with moderate infection rates (Arizona, Virginia) have more balanced or slightly strict-first patterns to smooth importation risk. By distributing traffic restrictions unevenly but ensuring total flow remains constant, the policy leverages temporal control to minimize cumulative infections and deaths. This cooperation balances mobility needs and epidemic risk across states and weeks. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection rates or transmission (beta) increase, stricter early-week controls would become more critical, whereas lower prevalence allows more even or relaxed schedules. This approach is robust to moderate parameter variations and aligns with epidemic control principles under SEIQRD dynamics."

    "notes": "Arizona exhibits a high exposed (E=144530) and infected (I=9229) population relative to its total population, indicating a substantial infection pressure. The imported infected cases are roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), where I/population is about 0.0011. Given the moderately high infection prevalence, a balanced approach using a slightly relaxed-first pattern was chosen to allow some initial mobility while gradually increasing restrictions as infection pressure peaks. This pattern balances control and economic activity to minimize cumulative infections and deaths. The fractions sum to exactly 1.0000, ensuring flow consistency."

    "notes": "Mississippi shows a relatively high exposed (E=36948) and infected (I=14308) proportion in a smaller population, leading to a high infection rate (I/pop ~0.030). This suggests a significant risk of importing infected individuals. We adopt a strict-first pattern, with lower flow fractions in earlier weeks to curb early importation and then gradually relax controls as prevalence potentially decreases. This trade-off limits the early seeding of infections, crucial for epidemic control, while balancing required mobility. Fractions sum to 1.0000 exactly, respecting total flow constraints."

Given this moderate risk and high baseline flow, an even distribution of traffic allocation is chosen to prevent sudden spikes in imported cases while maintaining steady economic activity.

The risk suggests a relaxed-first approach, allowing slightly increased flow in later weeks as control measures elsewhere reduce overall risk. This pattern helps smooth mobility restrictions while curbing early importation risk. The fractions add up to 1.0000 exactly, maintaining flow consistency."

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy distributes the inbound traffic flow to New Mexico from each origin state according to their infection prevalence and risk of importing infections. States with higher infection proportions like Mississippi receive stricter early controls to curb initial seeding. States with moderate or lower prevalence like Texas and Arizona have more balanced or relaxed-first patterns to maintain economic activity with controlled risk. By staggering controls across weeks, we reduce simultaneous importation peaks, lowering cumulative infections and deaths in New Mexico. This cooperation optimizes the trade-off between epidemic control and mobility. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls would be more beneficial, while lower prevalence allows more relaxed policies. This dynamic allocation helps adapt to changing epidemic conditions across states and time."
