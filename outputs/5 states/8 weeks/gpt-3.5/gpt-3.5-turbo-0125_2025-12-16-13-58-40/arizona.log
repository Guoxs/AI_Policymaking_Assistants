The imported infected cases approximately follow imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing early weeks' fractions lowers immediate infection importation. Given that Mississippi's infection prevalence shows slight decreasing trends, we adopt a strict-first pattern to impose stronger restrictions initially (weeks 1-4) and gradually relax controls later (weeks 5-8). This balances epidemic control by delaying importation to allow Arizona's local measures to stabilize, while maintaining total flow constant. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000."

However, its inbound flow is large (41,259 daily), so imported infections can accumulate. We choose a strict-first pattern to initially reduce flow fractions, then gradually relax in later weeks to balance risk and mobility. The relatively steady low prevalence supports gradual relaxation. This approach mitigates early surge risks while preserving mobility later. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

The large inbound flow (57,130) necessitates cautious smoothing of traffic to avoid sudden infection spikes.

We use a strict-first pattern, front-loading tight controls in weeks 1-2 to reduce early importation risk, then gradually relaxing but maintaining some control in later weeks due to observed steady infection levels. This approach provides front-loaded epidemic control while allowing some mobility recovery. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic allocations prioritize early strict control on states with higher infection prevalence (Mississippi, Virginia) and large flows (Texas), reducing imported infections in Arizona's most vulnerable initial weeks. States with lower infection prevalence (New Mexico) have more relaxed patterns later to balance mobility needs. By balancing the weekly fractions so that total inflow remains constant per origin, we avoid economic disruption while strategically delaying importation peaks to enable better local epidemic management. This cooperative pattern across states ensures Arizona's imported infection pressure is smoothed over time, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. Sensitivity analysis suggests if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls are warranted, while decreases allow more relaxed later traffic. Overall, these allocations collectively reduce the risk of sudden epidemic surges triggered by mobility, leveraging temporal distribution to optimize public health outcomes."

    "notes": "Mississippi shows a relatively high proportion of exposed (E=36948) and infected (I=14308) relative to its population (~6.6 million), indicating moderate infection pressure. The imported infected cases roughly scale as Flow * fraction * (I / population), so reducing flow early can cut initial imported infections. The pattern chosen is strict-first, with lower fractions in the first 4 weeks to suppress early imported risk, then slightly relaxed in later weeks as prevalence presumably drops. This balances epidemic control with mobility needs, allowing some normalization later without increasing total flow. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant."

The imported infected estimate is smaller compared to other states.

Early weeks have stricter controls (lower fractions) to reduce initial imported infections, following a strict-first pattern. Later weeks allow slightly relaxed controls to balance mobility.

The imported infected estimation suggests moderate initial risk that declines over time. A strict-first pattern is chosen with gradually increasing fractions to reduce early risk while allowing gradual normalization. This balances epidemic control with maintaining essential inbound mobility. Fractions sum to 1.000 exactly."
  },
  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic control policies reduce imported infection risk by prioritizing stricter controls in the earlier weeks when the infectious pressure is generally higher across origin states. Mississippi and Texas, with higher infected ratios, receive more front-loaded restrictions to curtail early importation. New Mexico, with lower prevalence, maintains even distribution to avoid unnecessary disruption. Virginia adopts a moderate strict-first approach reflecting intermediate risk. By keeping total inbound flows constant but adjusting weekly proportions, this strategy reduces the peak imported infections, flattening the infection curve in Arizona. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if beta or prevalence increases, stricter early restrictions become even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccination improves, controls could be relaxed earlier.
