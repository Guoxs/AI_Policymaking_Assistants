    "notes": "Arizona shows moderate exposed (E=60532) but low infected (I=3908) relative to its large susceptible population (S=8.8M). The imported infected per week is roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)). To reduce immediate risk, we apply a strict-first pattern with lower fractions early weeks (0.05 to 0.10) to curb early importation of infections, then gradually relax as we assume control measures and natural progression reduce prevalence. The trade-off balances epidemic control with mobility needs for economic activity. The fractions sum exactly to 1.00, ensuring total inflow volume is preserved."

We select a strict-first pattern, with higher control in later weeks (fractions decline from 0.17 to 0.06) to mitigate sustained import risk. Early moderate easing allows some mobility but restricts peak risk periods. The sum of fractions is exactly 1.00. This approach reduces peak importation while maintaining total flow."

We choose a strict-first pattern with lower inflow fractions early (0.08) to reduce immediate import risk, gradually relaxing through week 5-6 (0.18), then tapering down.

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocations prioritize reducing importation of infected individuals in the early weeks when cumulative infections in Texas are most vulnerable to new seeding. By applying strict-first patterns to states with higher prevalence (Mississippi, Virginia, Arizona), we limit early importation and allow subsequent relaxation as local control improves. For states with low prevalence but high flow (New Mexico), an even pattern reduces disruptions while managing risk. The quantitative cooperation logic balances weekly fractions so that total inbound flow remains constant but timing shifts to minimize cumulative infections and deaths. Sensitivity analysis shows that if beta (transmission rate) increases, stricter early controls would be more beneficial; if prevalence drops, more uniform relaxed patterns could be acceptable. This coordinated strategy across states reduces imported infection pressure and supports epidemic control in Texas effectively."

    "notes": "Arizona shows a large susceptible population (8,070,155) with a moderate exposed count (144,530) and relatively low infected (9,229) compared to its population. The infected fraction (I/S+E+I+Q+R+D) is small, but the exposed is high, indicating potential future increases in infections. The expected imported infected individuals per week can be approximated as Flow * fraction * (I / total population), suggesting that reducing flow early can prevent seeding infection in Texas. We chose a strict-first pattern, lowering fractions in the initial weeks to reduce early importation and then slightly relaxing later as risk decreases or stabilizes. This balances epidemic control and mobility, preventing early spikes while allowing some later mobility. The fractions sum to exactly 1 (1.000)."

Given this, a strict-first approach is used, with lower inbound fractions initially to mitigate early infection seeding, and slightly more relaxed control later to maintain mobility.

The risk of importing infected cases is significant. We use a strict-first pattern, with lower inbound fractions in early weeks to reduce early seeding of infections in Texas, gradually relaxing control as the situation hopefully improves. This trade-off favors reducing infections and deaths at the cost of more restrictive early mobility. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations across origin states prioritize reducing early importation of infections into Texas by adopting stricter controls in high-risk states (mississippi, virginia, arizona) at the beginning of the 8-week horizon. This reduces the initial seeding of infections, which is critical given the exponential nature of disease spread. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence (new mexico) have more relaxed early controls to maintain economic and social mobility. The weekly fractions sum to 1 per state ensuring total inbound flow remains constant, complying with constraints. Balancing control measures across states and weeks optimizes epidemic mitigation while maintaining mobility. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, even stricter early controls would be needed to prevent surges. Conversely, if prevalence falls, controls can be relaxed sooner. This coordinated, dynamic allocation minimizes cumulative infections and deaths by controlling temporal and spatial importation risks."
