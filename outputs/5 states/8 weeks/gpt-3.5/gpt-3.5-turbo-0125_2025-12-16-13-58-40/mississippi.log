The imported infections can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population). Given the relatively stable moderate infection prevalence, we adopt a slightly relaxed-first pattern with a mild increase in flow early on to allow some mobility, then stabilize, preventing sharp surges in imported infections. Trade-offs balance between controlling imported cases and maintaining reasonable mobility. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant."

Given this moderate risk, we choose an even pattern with slight front-loading to reduce early imported infections while maintaining steady flow later. This helps manage risk without severely disrupting mobility. The fractions add up to 1.000 exactly."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, these allocations aim to reduce imported infections and deaths in Mississippi by tailoring inbound flow patterns to each origin state's infection prevalence and epidemic dynamics. Strict-first patterns for high-prevalence states (Texas) reduce early importation risks, while relaxed or even patterns for low-prevalence states (New Mexico, Arizona, Virginia) balance epidemic control with mobility. This cooperative approach distributes traffic restrictions over time and states, minimizing cumulative exposure. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls would be even more crucial, while lower prevalence allows more relaxed controls. The traffic flows are conserved exactly, ensuring stable total inbound travel volumes while optimizing temporal distribution to mitigate disease spread."
