      "fractions": [0.3, 0.4, 0.3],
      "notes": "To minimize disease spread, I propose to implement stricter traffic control measures in the first week (f1=0.3) to reduce the initial influx of individuals from Arizona. This will be followed by a gradual relaxation in the subsequent weeks (f2=0.4, f3=0.3) to maintain a balance between controlling the spread and ensuring essential travel."
    },
  "mississippi": {
      "fractions": [0.5, 0.2, 0.3],
      "notes": "Considering the higher inflow from Mississippi, I recommend a higher restriction in the first week (f1=0.5) to limit the potential spread of the virus. This can be followed by a decrease in control in the second week (f2=0.2) and a moderate control in the third week (f3=0.3) to manage the inflow effectively."

  "texas": {
      "fractions": [0.2, 0.5, 0.3],
      "notes": "I suggest a moderate control approach for traffic from Texas. Starting with a lower control in the first week (f1=0.2) to allow essential travel, followed by tighter restrictions in the second week (f2=0.5) to mitigate potential risks. Finally, a balanced control in the third week (f3=0.3) to maintain safety while accommodating necessary travel."

  "virginia": {
      "fractions": [0.4, 0.3, 0.3],
      "notes": "For Virginia, I recommend a balanced approach to traffic control. Implementing moderate restrictions in the first week (f1=0.4) to manage the initial influx, followed by a slightly relaxed control in the second week (f2=0.3), and maintaining the same level of control in the third week (f3=0.3) to ensure a steady and controlled flow of individuals."

This approach ensures a balance between limiting disease spread and allowing essential travel, contributing to overall public health and safety."
