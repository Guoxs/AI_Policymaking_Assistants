To minimize the impact on Virginia, we adopt a strict-first pattern, concentrating stricter traffic control (lower fractions) in the early weeks to reduce the initial imported infections when Virginia's own epidemic is still sensitive. Relaxing controls gradually allows some mobility restoration later when local control improves. This approach balances epidemic control with mobility, preventing sudden spikes due to imported cases.

Applying a strict-first traffic control pattern reduces early week flows to prevent seeding new outbreaks in Virginia when its own epidemic is still vulnerable. Later weeks allow slightly increased flow to balance mobility needs. This trade-off helps suppress imported infections and deaths while maintaining reasonable travel.

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy for inbound traffic allocation to Virginia considers the infection prevalence and mobility flow from each origin state to minimize imported infections and subsequent morbidity and mortality. States with higher infection prevalence, such as New Mexico, are given stricter early controls (lower fractions in early weeks) to delay and reduce seeding of infections in Virginia. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence like Arizona have moderate early restrictions, balancing epidemic control with mobility needs. Mississippi’s pattern is more relaxed-first due to its low infected but higher exposed numbers, anticipating future infection changes. Texas, with very high flow and moderate infection prevalence, maintains a balanced approach with slight early restrictions to smooth importation pressures. This cooperative allocation across states helps distribute infection risks over time, preventing sharp spikes in Virginia’s epidemic curve. The fractions for each state sum exactly to 1, ensuring total flow remains constant but temporally redistributed. Sensitivity to prevalence changes or transmission rate beta suggests that if infection levels rise in any origin state, stricter early controls could be warranted to prevent importation surges. Conversely, if beta decreases or prevalence falls, relaxing controls earlier could be safe. This adaptive, data-driven policy supports minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia while maintaining essential mobility and economic activity."

States with higher infection prevalence, such as New Mexico, are given stricter early controls (lower fractions in early weeks) to delay and reduce seeding of infections in Virginia. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence like Arizona have moderate early restrictions, balancing epidemic control with mobility needs. Mississippi’s pattern is more relaxed-first due to its low infected but higher exposed numbers, anticipating future infection changes. Texas, with very high flow and moderate infection prevalence, maintains a balanced approach with slight early restrictions to smooth importation pressures. This cooperative allocation across states helps distribute infection risks over time, preventing sharp spikes in Virginia’s epidemic curve. The fractions for each state sum exactly to 1, ensuring total flow remains constant but temporally redistributed. Sensitivity to prevalence changes or transmission rate beta suggests that if infection levels rise in any origin state, stricter early controls could be warranted to prevent importation surges. Conversely, if beta decreases or prevalence falls, relaxing controls earlier could be safe. This adaptive, data-driven policy supports minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia while maintaining essential mobility and economic activity.'

    "notes": "Arizona shows moderate exposed (E=4309) and infected (I=1386) population relative to its large susceptible base (S=7121808). The imported infected estimate can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / total_population), where the population is roughly the sum of SEIQRD states. With a moderately stable infection rate, we apply a strict-first pattern, reducing inbound flow in the initial weeks (f1 and f2 are relatively low) to curb early importation of cases, then gradually relaxing. This balances controlling early disease spread with maintaining mobility over time. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000, ensuring total inbound flow remains unchanged."

The expected imported infections are proportional to Flow * ft * (I / population). Given the elevated exposed and infected numbers, a strict-first pattern is chosen to strongly limit inbound flow at the start (f1 and f2 highest restrictions) to reduce early importations, then gently increase flow as prevalence is expected to decline or control improves.

The imported infected cases scale with Flow * ft * (I / population). Due to this high infection pressure, a strict-first control pattern is optimal, imposing strong restrictions in early weeks to minimize initial importation, then gradually relaxing as the epidemic possibly stabilizes. This approach balances epidemic control with eventual mobility needs. Fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

The expected imported infected is roughly Flow * ft * (I / population). Given moderate infection pressure relative to population size, a mild strict-first pattern is used, with initial weeks slightly restricted to reduce importation risk, then gradually relaxing flow. This balances the high volume of inbound traffic (largest among origin states) and epidemic control. Fractions sum to 1.000 exactly."

  "global_guidance": "Across all origin states, the policy prioritizes strict controls in the early weeks to minimize the importation of infected individuals into Virginia when infection prevalence is highest and transmission risk is greatest. By front-loading traffic restrictions (strict-first pattern), we reduce the initial seeding of new cases and deaths locally. As weeks progress, gradual relaxation permits mobility recovery without significantly raising infection risk, balancing public health and economic considerations. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections scale with Flow * ft * (I / population) for each state-week; thus, lowering ft in weeks with high infection pressure reduces cumulative risk. Coordination across states ensures that restrictions are weighted by infection prevalence and inbound flow volume, which prevents shifting risk from one state to another. For instance, New Mexico with very high infection levels receives stronger early restrictions compared to Arizona or Texas. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increase, stricter or longer restrictions may be needed to maintain control, while reductions in prevalence allow earlier relaxation. This dynamic allocation optimizes cumulative case and death reductions in Virginia while preserving total inbound flow. The exact sum of fractions to 1.000 for each origin state ensures total inbound traffic volume remains consistent with baseline, fulfilling the mobility constraint."
