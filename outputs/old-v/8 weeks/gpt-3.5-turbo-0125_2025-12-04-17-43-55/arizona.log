States with higher infected ratios, like New Mexico, receive stricter early-week controls (lower fractions) to reduce early seeding of infections in Arizona. Mississippi also has moderately high infection pressure, warranting strict-first patterns. Texas, with a low infected ratio but large flow volume, receives an even allocation to balance mobility and epidemic control. Virginia's low infection pressure allows relaxed controls later after initial stricter weeks. This cross-state coordination balances risk, preventing overwhelming importation of cases early on and enabling gradual mobility restoration. Sensitivity to prevalence changes is significant: if infection rates increase in any origin, stricter early controls should be intensified. Similarly, if transmission beta rises, earlier and stricter control becomes more critical to prevent exponential growth in Arizona. Conversely, if prevalence or beta declines, relaxed allocations could be considered to ease mobility. Overall, the recommended traffic allocations strategically reduce cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by modulating imported infections through temporal traffic control patterns tailored to each origin state's epidemic status."

The key quantitative logic is that imported infected cases scale approximately as Flow * ft * (I/population) for each origin state and week. States with higher infected ratios, like New Mexico, receive stricter early-week controls (lower fractions) to reduce early seeding of infections in Arizona. Mississippi also has moderately high infection pressure, warranting strict-first patterns. Texas, with a low infected ratio but large flow volume, receives an even allocation to balance mobility and epidemic control. Virginia's low infection pressure allows relaxed controls later after initial stricter weeks. This cross-state coordination balances risk, preventing overwhelming importation of cases early on and enabling gradual mobility restoration. Sensitivity to prevalence changes is significant: if infection rates increase in any origin, stricter early controls should be intensified. Similarly, if transmission beta rises, earlier and stricter control becomes more critical to prevent exponential growth in Arizona. Conversely, if prevalence or beta declines, relaxed allocations could be considered to ease mobility. Overall, the recommended traffic allocations strategically reduce cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by modulating imported infections through temporal traffic control patterns tailored to each origin state's epidemic status."

    "notes": "Mississippi shows moderate exposed (E=11581) relative to infected (I=664) with a moderate susceptible population. The imported infected load to Arizona can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/Population), where Population is about 6.6 million. Given the moderate infection prevalence, a 'relaxed-first' pattern is chosen to delay higher inbound flow to later weeks, allowing Arizona to potentially reduce cases early. This pattern shifts more traffic to weeks 5-8 (15% each) and reduces early weeks to 10% each, to minimize early importation risk. The trade-off balances economic and social mobility with infection control, as too strict early controls may be disruptive. The fractions sum exactly to 1, validating the distribution. This approach assumes Mississippi's infection prevalence will decrease or be controlled in coming weeks, hence allowing some relaxation later."

    "notes": "New Mexico exhibits a very high exposed and infected population (E=36236, I=19908) relative to its population (~3.55 million). This signals a high risk of importing infected individuals into Arizona. Using the formula imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), the risk is substantial. Therefore, strict traffic control is warranted initially. We adopt a 'strict-first' pattern with only 5% of traffic allowed in each of the first four weeks, then gradually increasing to 17.5%, and finally relaxing to 22.5% in weeks 7-8, totaling 100%. This limits early imported infections, preventing early spikes in Arizona. The trade-off is economic and social disruption for New Mexico travelers early on, but necessary for epidemic control. The fractions sum to 1 exactly, confirming validity."

    "notes": "Texas has a large population with moderate exposed (E=13049) and infected (I=4358) numbers. Given its large inflow volume and moderate infection prevalence (~0.015% infected), an even distribution of traffic control is optimal to balance mobility and epidemic control. The imported infected load is proportional to traffic flow fractions, hence even fractions (12.5% each week) minimize abrupt spikes and allow steady control. This 'even' pattern avoids high risk weeks while maintaining predictable inflow. Trade-offs include consistency in mobility and epidemic pressure management without overburdening any particular week.

    "notes": "Virginia has relatively low infected (I=625) and exposed (E=2357) compared to its population (~8.4 million). Infection pressure is lower, but caution is still needed due to non-negligible inflow. Using the imported infected approximation, early weeks are restricted to 8% each to limit early imports, then moderately relaxed to 12% in weeks 5-6, and more relaxed to 22% in weeks 7-8. This 'relaxed-first' pattern helps keep Arizona's early epidemic burden low while allowing mobility recovery later. This balances health risk and mobility needs. The fractions sum exactly to 1."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic control policy across origin states collectively targets minimizing imported infections and subsequent cases and deaths in Arizona. States with higher infection prevalence and exposed populations, like New Mexico, receive stricter early restrictions, reducing early imported infectious pressure and allowing Arizona to stabilize its epidemic. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence, like Virginia and Mississippi, have traffic shifted towards later weeks, balancing control with economic and social mobility. Texas, due to its large population and moderate infection levels, is held to an even traffic distribution to avoid sudden epidemic spikes. Quantitatively, the expected imported infected each week is proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), so adjusting ft by infection prevalence and epidemic trends allows tailored risk management. The weekly fractions sum to 1 per state, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant. This coordinated approach reduces peak imported infections and prevents overwhelming Arizona's health system. Sensitivity analysis suggests if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls would be necessary, especially on high-prevalence states. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, traffic can be relaxed earlier. The policy balances epidemic control with maintaining essential mobility and economic activity, aiming for sustainable epidemic mitigation over the next 8 weeks."
