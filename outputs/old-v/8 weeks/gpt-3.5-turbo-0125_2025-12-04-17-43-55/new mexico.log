  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic control policies for New Mexico's origin states are designed to minimize imported infections and resultant confirmed cases and deaths by considering infection prevalence, population sizes, and inflow volumes. Texas, with its large inflow and moderate infected prevalence, receives the strictest early restrictions to reduce the highest risk of imported infections during the initial 4 weeks. Arizona, despite large inflow, has very low infected prevalence, allowing for a more relaxed pattern but still enforcing early controls to protect New Mexico's sizable infected population. Mississippi and Virginia have smaller inflows and lower infected prevalence, permitting more even distributions with moderate control. Balancing stricter early controls with later relaxation ensures epidemic pressures are managed when New Mexico's own population is vulnerable (significant exposed and infected counts), while mobility and economic activities can resume progressively. Quantitatively, this allocation reduces expected imported infections by lowering weekly fractions during high-risk periods and redistributing traffic to lower-risk weeks. Sensitivity analysis suggests if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early restrictions would be necessary, especially for high-volume states like Texas. Conversely, if prevalence drops, controls could be relaxed across weeks to support mobility. These policies reflect an adaptive, risk-informed approach that balances public health and economic considerations."

Texas, with its large inflow and moderate infected prevalence, receives the strictest early restrictions to reduce the highest risk of imported infections during the initial 4 weeks. Arizona, despite large inflow, has very low infected prevalence, allowing for a more relaxed pattern but still enforcing early controls to protect New Mexico's sizable infected population. Mississippi and Virginia have smaller inflows and lower infected prevalence, permitting more even distributions with moderate control. Balancing stricter early controls with later relaxation ensures epidemic pressures are managed when New Mexico's own population is vulnerable (significant exposed and infected counts), while mobility and economic activities can resume progressively. Quantitatively, this allocation reduces expected imported infections by lowering weekly fractions during high-risk periods and redistributing traffic to lower-risk weeks. Sensitivity analysis suggests if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early restrictions would be necessary, especially for high-volume states like Texas. Conversely, if prevalence drops, controls could be relaxed across weeks to support mobility. These policies reflect an adaptive, risk-informed approach that balances public health and economic considerations."

    "notes": "Arizona's population shows a very low proportion of active infected individuals (I=1386) relative to a large susceptible population (S=7121808). The exposed count (E=4309) is also low, indicating controlled transmission. The risk of importing infections is proportional to Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)). Given Arizona's substantial inflow into New Mexico (43660.18 daily), the total imported infections will depend heavily on the weekly fractions. We apply a relaxed-first traffic pattern, gradually increasing mobility restrictions over the 8 weeks. This is justified as Arizona's infection levels are low and stable, allowing some initial relaxed control to support mobility and economy, but stricter controls later to prevent resurgence. The fractions sum to exactly 1, ensuring total flow remains constant. The trade-off balances epidemic control and economic activity by front-loading relaxed mobility and tightening as weeks progress to minimize cumulative cases and deaths."

    "notes": "Mississippi shows a moderate exposed count (E=11581) compared to a smaller infected count (I=664) and population (S=2837877). This indicates a potentially increasing but not currently high infection pressure. Given the smaller average daily inflow to New Mexico (1829.29), the expected imported infections are smaller but non-negligible, computed as Flow*ft*(I/population). We adopt a relaxed-first pattern, starting with stronger restrictions (low fractions) and gradually easing them. This approach mitigates early importation risk when exposed cases are rising, while maintaining some mobility benefits later. The sum of fractions is exactly 1, preserving total traffic volume. This strategy balances epidemic control with economic considerations, emphasizing caution early to reduce transmission risk."

The risk of imported infections is substantial due to both high flow and moderate infection prevalence. Quantitatively, imported infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/(total population)), with total population around 28.5 million. We choose a relaxed-first pattern, starting with strict controls to reduce early importation risk, then gradually relaxing to balance mobility and economic needs. The fractions sum exactly to 1, ensuring consistent total inbound flow. This approach prioritizes epidemic control early to limit new outbreaks, then incrementally eases restrictions to avoid prolonged economic impact."

    "notes": "Virginia exhibits low infection prevalence with I=625 and E=2357 in a population of 8.4 million, indicating low transmission risk. The average daily inflow to New Mexico is 1310.36, relatively small. Imported infected cases are thus low, approximated by Flow*ft*(I/population). We adopt a relaxed-first pattern, allowing greater mobility initially to support economic activity while keeping some controls to prevent spikes. The fractions sum to 1 precisely. This strategy balances low risk of importation with maintaining travel and commerce."

  "global_guidance": "The traffic control policy across states strategically balances epidemic control and mobility by adjusting weekly inbound traffic fractions based on infection prevalence and flow magnitudes. States with higher infection pressure and larger flows (Texas, Arizona) start with stricter controls that progressively relax, mitigating early importation risk while supporting economic activity later. States with lower infection prevalence (Virginia) or smaller flows (Mississippi) use a relaxed-first pattern with gradually increasing fractions, reflecting lower risk and allowing more immediate mobility. This cooperation reduces cumulative imported infections by distributing restrictions temporally and spatially, avoiding simultaneous peaks of inflow that could overwhelm control measures. Quantitatively, the policy minimizes imported infected cases by modulating fractions to lower weeks with higher infection prevalence or flow, balancing the trade-off between epidemic suppression and economic impact. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, earlier and stricter controls become more critical to prevent exponential growth. If beta decreases, more relaxed policies with even distributions could be feasible. This dynamic approach ensures adaptive, data-driven traffic control to minimize cases and deaths in New Mexico while recognizing the importance of interstate mobility."
