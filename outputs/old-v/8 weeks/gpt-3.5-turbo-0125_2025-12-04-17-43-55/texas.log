The population is about 7.25 million. The inbound flow is high (48811 daily on average). The expected imported infected cases can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population) = 48811 * ft * (297 / 7,247,000) which is relatively low but still non-negligible. Given the steady but relatively low infection prevalence, a gradual relaxation pattern is appropriate, starting with strict controls (low fractions) and progressively relaxing to reduce economic impact while controlling risk. The fractions sum exactly to 1. This strict-first pattern allows minimizing imported infections during early weeks with higher risk, then relaxing controls as the infection risk reduces or stabilizes."

The inbound flow is moderate (58434 daily average). The expected imported infected is Flow * ft * (I / population) = 58434 * ft * (189 / 2,958,000), which is low but outbreak risk exists due to E and I values. A mildly strict-first traffic control pattern is chosen to initially curb inbound risk and slowly relax over time as prevalence monitoring continues.

  "global_guidance": "The cross-state traffic control policy aims to collectively minimize imported infections into Texas by balancing strictness and relaxation across states and weeks based on their respective infection pressures and flows. States with higher infection prevalence and larger inbound flows, such as New Mexico, are subjected to stricter early-week controls to sharply reduce early imported infections when risk is highest, then gradually relax to restore mobility. States with moderate risk like Arizona and Mississippi follow a strict-first pattern but with less aggressive early reductions, balancing epidemic control and economic activity. Virginia, with low prevalence and moderate flow, applies an even pattern to maintain steady control. This cooperative approach balances the total inbound flow constraints while timing restrictions to flatten importation peaks, reducing cumulative infections and deaths in Texas. The quantitative logic is based on the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population), which guides stricter controls when the product is higher, and relaxation when lower or risk stabilizes. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter and earlier controls would be necessary, especially for high-risk states, to avoid overwhelming Texas' healthcare system. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, controls can be relaxed sooner. This dynamic and state-specific allocation optimizes epidemic control while minimizing economic disruption across the 8-week horizon."

The imported infections can be approximated by Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)), where Flow is the daily inbound flow and ft is the fraction of traffic allowed that week. Since the infected proportion is low but not negligible, and mobility baseline suggests substantial traffic (44,315 daily), a strict-first pattern is chosen to front-load traffic restrictions.

For New Mexico, due to its notably higher infection rates, a gradual relaxation pattern is chosen to carefully balance epidemic risk and mobility needs. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections are proportional to each state's infection prevalence and the traffic fraction per week. By adjusting these fractions while holding total inbound flow constant, we reduce peak importation risk and distribute traffic to weeks with relatively lower epidemic pressure. This cooperative allocation across states and weeks helps flatten the imported infection curve, contributing to lower cumulative cases and deaths in Texas. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter and earlier traffic controls would be more effective. Conversely, if prevalence falls, more relaxed traffic could be allowed sooner. The strategy is robust but should be re-evaluated with updated data to adapt to epidemic dynamics.

This cross-state approach balances epidemic containment with mobility needs, reducing peak importation risk while allowing gradual traffic recovery.

    "notes": "Arizona shows a moderate infectious population (I=1386) relative to its susceptible population (S=7,121,808), with a relatively low exposed count (E=4309). The infection pressure importing to Texas can be approximated as imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), where the population is roughly S+E+I+Q+R+D. Arizona’s average daily inbound flow to Texas for the next 8 weeks is stable at ~53,498. Given the moderate I/Population ratio (~0.00019) and steady flow, a slight front-loading of restrictions (strict-first pattern) is chosen to reduce early imported infections while gradually relaxing controls as the epidemic is expected to stabilize. This approach balances epidemic control with mobility needs to avoid severe economic disruption. The fractions sum exactly to 1, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant over 8 weeks."

    "notes": "Mississippi’s infectious count (I=664) is lower proportionally to its susceptible population (S=2,837,877), but it has a higher exposed (E=11,581) relative to I, indicating a potential increase in infections soon. Imported infections scale as Flow*ft*(I/population). The average daily inbound flow from Mississippi to Texas is ~42,980. Due to the risk of upcoming infections, a more even distribution of traffic control (even pattern) is applied to maintain steady but controlled inflow, avoiding spikes in imported cases. This also allows some consistent mobility to avoid harsh economic impacts. The fractions total exactly 1, preserving overall flow balance."

    "notes": "New Mexico has a high exposed (E=36,236) and infected (I=19,908) relative to its susceptible population (S=1,557,169), indicating a significant epidemic pressure. Imported infections are roughly Flow*ft*(I/population), which is elevated here. The daily inbound flow to Texas (~82,355) is the largest among origin states. A strict-first pattern with more restrictive controls in the early weeks is used to sharply reduce imported infections when the risk is highest, followed by gradual relaxation as local epidemic pressure may decline. This pattern mitigates risk of overwhelming Texas healthcare and reduces deaths. Fractions sum to 1 exactly, maintaining consistent total flow."

    "notes": "Virginia has relatively low infected (I=625) and exposed (E=2357) compared to its susceptible population (S=8,403,360), indicating lower immediate epidemic risk. The imported infections estimated by Flow*ft*(I/population) are relatively low. The inbound flow to Texas is ~23,034 daily. A mild strict-first pattern is chosen to keep initial control while allowing moderate relaxation later to sustain mobility and economic activity. This balances epidemic control and travel needs effectively. The fractions sum precisely to 1, ensuring total flow remains unchanged."
  },
  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy balances epidemic control and mobility by adjusting inbound traffic flow fractions for each origin state based on their epidemic pressure (I and E relative to population) and average daily inbound flow to Texas. States with higher infection prevalence and exposure, such as New Mexico, receive stricter controls early (lower fractions) to minimize immediate imported infections and deaths, with gradual relaxation as risk reduces. States with moderate or low infection levels, such as Arizona, Mississippi, and Virginia, have more balanced or mild strict-first patterns to maintain continuous but controlled flow, thereby reducing sudden spikes in imported cases. The total inbound flow from each origin state remains constant over the 8 weeks, satisfying the constraint of fixed total flow but shifting weekly proportions to optimize epidemic outcomes. This cooperative allocation across states reduces the risk of overwhelming Texas's healthcare system by spreading out imported infections over time. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter front-loading patterns would be more beneficial, while lower prevalence allows more even or relaxed-first patterns. The coordinated multi-state approach ensures that Texas mitigates imported infection risk efficiently while minimizing disruption to mobility and economic activity."
