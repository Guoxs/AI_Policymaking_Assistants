Given these factors, a relaxed-first pattern is chosen, starting with moderate restrictions (ft=0.10) to contain immediate risk, then gradually relaxing to ft=0.15 in later weeks as the risk is expected to remain low or decrease.

Given this, a slightly front-loaded strict control (strict-first pattern) is chosen to reduce early imported infections, as the infection level is stable but non-negligible.

States with higher infection prevalence (new mexico) receive stricter controls early (strict-first pattern) to reduce initial imported infections, critical for curbing local outbreaks. Moderate-risk states with large inflows (texas) adopt a relaxed-first approach allowing some mobility initially but increasing controls as needed, balancing economic activity and epidemic risk. Low-risk states (virginia, arizona) employ even or slightly front-loaded strict patterns to maintain controlled, stable inflows. Quantitatively, imported infected cases are proportional to inflow * fraction * (I / population), so allocating lower fractions to high-risk weeks reduces imported infections. The total flow is conserved by ensuring fractions sum to 1, redistributing traffic temporally rather than reducing volume. Sensitivity to prevalence or transmission rates means if infection rates rise, stricter front-loading becomes more beneficial. Conversely, if prevalence drops, more even or relaxed policies suffice. This coordinated temporal modulation of inbound traffic reduces Mississippi's epidemic burden while balancing mobility needs across states and weeks."

States with higher infection prevalence (new mexico) receive stricter controls early (strict-first pattern) to reduce initial imported infections, critical for curbing local outbreaks. Moderate-risk states with large inflows (texas) adopt a relaxed-first approach allowing some mobility initially but increasing controls as needed, balancing economic activity and epidemic risk. Low-risk states (virginia, arizona) employ even or slightly front-loaded strict patterns to maintain controlled, stable inflows. Quantitatively, imported infected cases are proportional to inflow * fraction * (I / population), so allocating lower fractions to high-risk weeks reduces imported infections. The total flow is conserved by ensuring fractions sum to 1, redistributing traffic temporally rather than reducing volume. Sensitivity to prevalence or transmission rates means if infection rates rise, stricter front-loading becomes more beneficial. Conversely, if prevalence drops, more even or relaxed policies suffice. This coordinated temporal modulation of inbound traffic reduces Mississippi's epidemic burden while balancing mobility needs across states and weeks."

    "notes": "Arizona's population shows a low exposed (E=4309) and infected (I=1386) compared to its susceptible population (S=7121808), indicating moderate risk. The expected imported infections are proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), and since the I/S ratio is relatively low, a moderate relaxation of controls in later weeks is justified. The chosen pattern is relaxed-first, as the infection pressure is currently moderate and stable, allowing some initial easing followed by stricter controls if necessary. This balances the need to reduce imported infections and maintain mobility. The fractions sum to exactly 1.00, ensuring the total 8-week inbound flow remains constant."

The imported infection risk is Flow*ft*(I/population), suggesting stricter control in early weeks to reduce initial importation. Therefore, a strict-first pattern is adopted, starting with lower fractions and gradually relaxing controls as infection pressure is expected to decrease or as immunity builds.

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Mississippi, the inbound traffic control policy strategically redistributes weekly inbound flows from all origin states while keeping total 8-week flows constant. States with higher infection pressure, such as New Mexico, have stricter controls in the initial weeks (lower fractions), reducing imported infections when Mississippi's own infection load is significant. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure, like Virginia and Arizona, have a relaxed-first pattern, allowing slightly higher inbound flows early or mid-periods to sustain mobility with manageable risk. Texas, with a large population and moderate infection prevalence, adopts a strict-first approach to mitigate risk while balancing economic activity. This coordinated approach leverages the formula imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), dynamically adjusting ft to reduce peak infection importations. The weekly fractions sum to 1 for each state, preserving total mobility volumes and ensuring no overall mobility loss. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls would yield larger benefits in reducing disease spread. Conversely, if local Mississippi prevalence declines significantly, more relaxed patterns can be considered. This policy framework balances epidemic control and mobility, providing a coherent, data-driven strategy for Mississippi's inbound traffic management."
