Early strictness in higher-risk states reduces imported infections initially, lowering secondary transmission risk in Texas.

  "global_guidance": "The selected inbound traffic control strategies collectively aim to minimize imported infections while preserving essential mobility to Texas. States with higher infection and exposure rates (New Mexico, Arizona) are assigned the 'strict-first' strategy to reduce early high-risk inflows, protecting Texas when its own epidemic burden remains significant. Mississippi, with a growing epidemic trend, uses a 'relaxed-first-then-strict' approach to balance early mobility needs with precaution against later surges. Virginia, with lower prevalence and moderate inflow, employs a mid-strict consistent pattern to maintain steady but cautious mobility. This multi-state coordinated approach balances cumulative imported infection risk by front-loading restrictions where epidemic risk is highest and allowing relaxation where safer. Quantitatively, imported infected can be approximated as inflow * fraction * (I/pop). By modulating fractions weekly, this strategy reduces the peak importation burden and distributes mobility flexibly. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become more critical, especially from high-prevalence states. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccines reduce transmission (lower beta), more relaxed strategies could be considered to enhance mobility.

States with higher infection and exposure rates (New Mexico, Arizona) are assigned the 'strict-first' strategy to reduce early high-risk inflows, protecting Texas when its own epidemic burden remains significant. Mississippi, with a growing epidemic trend, uses a 'relaxed-first-then-strict' approach to balance early mobility needs with precaution against later surges. Virginia, with lower prevalence and moderate inflow, employs a mid-strict consistent pattern to maintain steady but cautious mobility. This multi-state coordinated approach balances cumulative imported infection risk by front-loading restrictions where epidemic risk is highest and allowing relaxation where safer. Quantitatively, imported infected can be approximated as inflow * fraction * (I/pop). By modulating fractions weekly, this strategy reduces the peak importation burden and distributes mobility flexibly. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become more critical, especially from high-prevalence states. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccines reduce transmission (lower beta), more relaxed strategies could be considered to enhance mobility. This carefully calibrated multi-state policy supports Texas’s epidemic control goals while considering economic and social mobility imperatives."

    "notes": "Arizona shows a moderate epidemic risk with a population of approximately 7.1 million susceptible individuals and relatively low exposed (4254) and infected (1378) counts compared to its population size. The infected proportion (I/S) is roughly 0.00019, which is low but given the large inbound flow to Texas (average daily ~53,498), even small prevalence can contribute to imported infections. Calculating imported infected individuals as Flow * fraction * (I / total population), the presence of a moderately sized infected pool and high mobility suggests an elevated risk early on. Therefore, a \"strict first then relaxed\" strategy (S1) is suitable to minimize initial importation risk by enforcing strict controls in early weeks to curb influx of infections, subsequently relaxing as local conditions improve. This balances epidemiological safety with mobility needs, gradually restoring travel and economic activity. The high early restrictions reduce imported cases during higher epidemic activity, while later relaxation leverages improving epidemic control and immunity buildup in Texas. The trade-off prioritizes minimizing imported infections while allowing phased reopening."

    "notes": "Mississippi has a smaller population (~2.8 million susceptible) but exhibits a notable exposed count (10400) relative to infected (598), indicating ongoing but controlled transmission. The infected proportion (I/S) is approximately 0.00021, slightly higher than Arizona's, but with lower inbound flow to Texas (~42,980 daily), the absolute imported infection risk is moderate. The balanced mid-strict strategy (S4) with moderately strict control in the middle weeks and slightly relaxed early and late weeks fits this profile by smoothing mobility restrictions over time rather than front-loading or back-loading. This approach mitigates infection import risk during the peak exposure phase while allowing some mobility to sustain economic and social activity. The strategy reflects a conservative but balanced trade-off, acknowledging Mississippi's moderate epidemic risk and the importance of maintaining steady mobility without abrupt changes."

    "notes": "New Mexico's epidemic profile is concerning, with a high exposed count (35965) and significant infected population (19809) relative to its susceptible population (~1.55 million). The infected proportion (I/S) is about 0.0128, substantially higher than other origin states. Coupled with a large inbound flow to Texas (82,355 daily), this poses a high risk of importing active infections. The \"strict first then relaxed\" strategy (S1) is selected to impose stringent mobility controls initially to curb infection importation during the epidemic peak in New Mexico. This approach allows Texas to limit imported infections when New Mexico’s infection prevalence is highest, then gradually relax restrictions as the epidemic wanes. The early strict control phase is crucial to protect Texas from a significant influx of infectious individuals, while the later relaxation phase balances essential mobility and economic activity once risk diminishes. This strategy prioritizes epidemic control given New Mexico's high risk."

    "notes": "Virginia presents a relatively low infection risk with infected count at 616 and exposed 2323 among a large susceptible population (~8.4 million). The infected proportion (I/S) is approximately 0.00007, the lowest among origin states. Inbound flow to Texas is moderate (~23,034 daily). Given this low prevalence and moderate flow, a more relaxed mid-period strategy (S5) is appropriate, allowing slightly higher mobility during mid weeks when infection risk is lower. This pattern supports steady travel and economic exchange while maintaining some control to prevent unexpected spikes. The moderate restrictions balance Texas’s need for essential connectivity with the low epidemic threat posed by Virginia, minimizing social disruption while managing epidemic risk prudently."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies collectively aim to minimize imported infections and deaths in Texas by tailoring strategies to each origin state's epidemic risk and mobility contribution. States with higher infected proportions and larger inbound flows, such as New Mexico and Arizona, receive stricter initial controls (S1) to suppress early importation risk when active infections are high. Mid-risk states like Mississippi employ a balanced mid-strict strategy (S4) to smooth restrictions and adapt to epidemic phases, while low-risk states such as Virginia are assigned a mid-relaxed pattern (S5) to maintain essential mobility with moderate controls. This cross-state risk-based differentiation optimizes resource allocation and epidemic control, ensuring Texas reduces cumulative cases without unnecessarily hindering economic and social activities. The cooperation logic balances weekly import risks by modulating fractions over eight weeks, frontloading restrictions where necessary and relaxing as risks decline or immunity builds. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter and more front-loaded controls will be even more critical to prevent overwhelming imported infections. Conversely, lower prevalence or enhanced local control in Texas may allow more relaxed patterns. This nuanced, data-driven approach leverages SEIQRD epidemiology and mobility baselines to harmonize disease control with mobility preservation, ultimately safeguarding public health while sustaining vital interstate connections."
