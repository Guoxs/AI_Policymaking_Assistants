Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas share moderate to high infection prevalences combined with significant inbound flows, warranting early strict control strategies ('S1_strict_first_then_relaxed') to sharply reduce immediate importation risk. Mississippi, with moderate infection prevalence but lower flow, benefits from a relaxed-to-strict strategy ('S2_relaxed_first_then_strict'), allowing initial mobility while escalating controls as risk evolves, reflecting its dynamic exposed pool. Collectively, these strategies minimize cumulative imported infections by frontloading restrictions where prevalence and flow are highest, mitigating seeding of new cases in Virginia during critical early weeks. This staggered approach also spreads the social and economic burden of restrictions over time and origin states, enhancing cooperation and compliance. The quantitative logic relies on infection import approximations (imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/pop)) to prioritize strictness based on both prevalence and flow magnitude. Sensitivity analyses highlight that shifts in prevalence or transmission rates (beta) would necessitate recalibration; for instance, rising beta increases effective import risk, justifying more prolonged strict controls, whereas declining prevalence supports earlier relaxation. Such adaptive policies ensure Virginia can dynamically balance epidemic containment with essential mobility, preserving public health and economic vitality."

This approach balances minimizing imported infections and deaths in Virginia with sustaining essential mobility. By front-loading restrictions (strict-first-then-relaxed), the policies reduce early seeding events, which is crucial given the exponential nature of disease spread and Virginia's current epidemic state. The mid-strict pattern for Mississippi acknowledges its latent risk and moderate flow, further balancing control and mobility. Quantitatively, imported infections are proportional to flow, fraction, and infected ratio; thus, reducing fractions early for high-risk states sharply lowers expected imported infections. Over time, as local and external prevalence are expected to decline, relaxing controls preserves vital economic and social interactions. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter or prolonged controls would be necessary to maintain safety. Conversely, if prevalence declines or beta reduces, relaxation could accelerate to enhance mobility without compromising epidemic control. This cooperative, dynamic approach ensures Virginia's epidemic objectives are met across diverse origin states, optimizing public health outcomes and mobility needs in a coordinated manner."

The exposed population (E=4254) further indicates ongoing transmission. The average past 56-day inbound flow into Virginia from Arizona is very high (13,183,241 historically, with a current baseline around 6,778 daily). The imported infections scale approximately as Flow * ft * (I/pop), so controlling early weeks strictly reduces early importation risk and delays spread within Virginia. Using the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' pattern prioritizes strong early control (low fractions) followed by gradual relaxation, balancing epidemic suppression with eventual mobility needs. This strategy mitigates immediate infection import risk from Arizona's moderately high prevalence while allowing economic and social mobility to recover progressively. The trade-off is managing short-term mobility limitations from Arizona arrivals to protect Virginia's relatively lower infected population and preserve healthcare capacity."

Population size is smaller (~2.8 million susceptible), but the infection prevalence is notable. The historical average inbound flow to Virginia is low (~3,461), but still sufficient to pose risk. Applying the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy aligns with the need to impose stringent early restrictions to prevent importation of cases during the outbreak's growth phase. This approach minimizes early infections imported into Virginia, which is crucial given Mississippi's rising exposure. As the outbreak evolves, gradual relaxation balances economic and personal mobility needs with public health goals. The trade-off involves accepting short-term inbound restrictions from Mississippi to protect Virginia's epidemic status while preserving longer-term mobility."

The infection prevalence is substantially higher than other origin states, posing a serious risk for importing infections into Virginia. The average past 56-day inbound flow is low (~1,603 daily), which limits the volume of potentially imported infections, but the high prevalence necessitates careful timing of controls. The 'S2_relaxed_first_then_strict' strategy is chosen to initially allow some mobility to accommodate essential travel but then progressively intensify restrictions to curb late-stage importation risks, reflecting the high prevalence and potential outbreak severity in New Mexico. This U-shaped approach balances initial essential mobility with escalating control as risks persist, aiming to minimize total imported infections and deaths. The trade-off involves accepting some early import risk but preventing sustained transmission by tightening controls over time."

The large average past 56-day inbound flow into Virginia (~22,149 daily) means Texas is a major source of potential imported infections. Given the moderate infection prevalence and the high mobility volume, a strategy emphasizing strict early controls followed by relaxation ('S1_strict_first_then_relaxed') is appropriate. Early restrictions reduce the immediate risk of importing infected individuals, critical to protecting Virginia's epidemic status and healthcare capacity. Gradual relaxation later allows economic and social activities to resume in balance with epidemic control.

Mississippi, with rising exposed cases but lower flow, follows the same pattern to preemptively curb import risk during outbreak growth. New Mexico, with very high infection prevalence but low flow, adopts a 'relaxed first then strict' approach ('S2_relaxed_first_then_strict') to accommodate essential early mobility but tighten controls as outbreak risks persist, preventing sustained importation. This cross-state allocation strategically balances risk across weeks and origins, smoothing epidemic peaks within Virginia while preserving essential travel and economic activity. The quantitative infection-import logic relies on the product of inflow, infection prevalence (I/pop), and time-dependent fractions (ft), guiding control intensity. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early controls become even more critical to prevent exponential importation growth. Conversely, lower prevalence or reduced transmission would allow more relaxed allocations without significant epidemic consequences.
