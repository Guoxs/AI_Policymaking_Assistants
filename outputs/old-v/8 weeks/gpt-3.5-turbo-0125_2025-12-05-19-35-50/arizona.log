The average daily inbound flow to Arizona from Mississippi is relatively low (~2554), which somewhat limits absolute imported infections.

Given this combination of high prevalence and large mobility, a strict-first-then-relaxed approach (S1) is optimal to aggressively curb imported infections in the early weeks when Arizona is most vulnerable.

The inbound flow into Arizona from Mississippi averages 2029.64 daily, which is relatively low compared to other states.

The S1 pattern (strict first then relaxed) is appropriate because it prioritizes containment in early weeks when epidemic risk might be higher due to imported cases, then gradually relaxes controls to restore mobility and economic activity.

  "global_guidance": "The selected strategies collectively aim to minimize imported infections and deaths in Arizona by tailoring control intensity to each origin state's infection prevalence and mobility volume. States with higher infection prevalence and large flows (New Mexico, Texas) receive stricter or phased strategies with strong early or mid-period controls to suppress importation risk during critical weeks. Conversely, states with low prevalence (Mississippi, Virginia) have more moderate or phased controls to preserve mobility while managing residual risk. This cross-state balancing reduces cumulative imported infection pressure, thus lowering Arizona's epidemic burden. Quantitatively, the imported infected per week ~ Flow * ft * (I/pop) is minimized by deploying stricter controls (lower ft) in weeks with highest risk or flow, while relaxing controls when risk subsides, optimizing trade-offs between epidemic suppression and essential mobility. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, earlier and stricter controls become even more critical to prevent exponential seeding. Conversely, if prevalence declines, more relaxed patterns can be safely adopted. This adaptive, data-driven approach ensures Arizona's epidemic control is both effective and sustainable over the next 8 weeks."

States with higher infection prevalence and large flows (New Mexico, Texas) receive stricter or phased strategies with strong early or mid-period controls to suppress importation risk during critical weeks. Conversely, states with low prevalence (Mississippi, Virginia) have more moderate or phased controls to preserve mobility while managing residual risk. This cross-state balancing reduces cumulative imported infection pressure, thus lowering Arizona's epidemic burden. Quantitatively, the imported infected per week ~ Flow * ft * (I/pop) is minimized by deploying stricter controls (lower ft) in weeks with highest risk or flow, while relaxing controls when risk subsides, optimizing trade-offs between epidemic suppression and essential mobility. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, earlier and stricter controls become even more critical to prevent exponential seeding. Conversely, if prevalence declines, more relaxed patterns can be safely adopted. This adaptive, data-driven approach ensures Arizona's epidemic control is both effective and sustainable over the next 8 weeks."

    "notes": "Mississippi's SEIQRD values show a moderate exposed population (E=10400) compared to a relatively low infected count (I=598) relative to its total population (~6.6 million). The ratio I/pop is approximately 9.0e-5, indicating a modest infectious prevalence. With an average daily inflow to Arizona around 1740, the risk of importing infections is moderate. Calculating imported_infected roughly as Flow * ft * (I/pop), stricter restrictions early on (low initial fractions) minimize immediate imported infections during potential peak transmissibility periods and provide time for Arizona's local epidemic to stabilize. Given the moderate infection rate in Mississippi, a strict-first-then-relaxed strategy (S1) reduces early risk while allowing mobility later when Arizona's local control may be better. This balances epidemic control and essential mobility, as relaxing too soon risks seeding outbreaks in Arizona. Hence, S1 is appropriate to limit initial importation risk from Mississippi while preserving eventual mobility."

    "notes": "New Mexico presents a significantly higher infectious prevalence with I=19809 out of ~3.55 million population, yielding an I/pop ratio of approximately 0.00558, much higher than other states. The high exposed (E=35965) and infected populations coupled with a large average daily inflow into Arizona (~28751) pose substantial importation risk. However, given the large volume of daily travel and the economic and social ties between Arizona and New Mexico, an immediate strict reduction might disrupt essential mobility and cause significant adverse impacts. A relaxed-first-then-strict approach (S2) allows for necessary mobility in the early weeks, possibly reflecting urgent travel needs or seasonal factors, but then progressively tightens restrictions as Arizona’s local epidemic evolves and more data becomes available. This strategy balances the high initial infection risk with practical mobility needs, aiming to reduce cumulative imported cases over time while not abruptly cutting critical flows."

    "notes": "Texas has a moderate infectious prevalence with I=4125 over a large population (~29 million), yielding a lower I/pop ratio (~1.44e-4). Despite the relatively low prevalence, Texas contributes a very high daily inflow (~54819), the largest among all origin states. The volume of movement poses a significant risk of importing infections even if prevalence is low. The mid-strict strategy (S4) with moderately low fractions in the middle weeks balances the need to reduce importation during potential peak transmission periods without overly restricting mobility in early and late weeks. This approach mitigates the risk of sudden surges from Texas while preserving essential economic and social connectivity, recognizing Texas’s importance as a major traffic contributor and source of labor and goods to Arizona."

    "notes": "Virginia shows a low infectious prevalence with I=616 over ~8.4 million population, an I/pop ratio of ~7.3e-5, similar to Mississippi but with a slightly smaller exposed population (E=2323). The daily inflow to Arizona is moderate (~5141). Given the low infection levels but non-negligible flow, a strict-first-then-relaxed approach (S1) is prudent to prevent any early importation events that could seed outbreaks in Arizona. Early strict control reduces risk during critical initial weeks, while relaxed later weeks accommodate mobility needs, especially as local Arizona conditions may improve. This policy balances public health protection with maintaining connectivity, minimizing risk from a relatively low prevalence but significant travel volume state."

  "global_guidance": "The collective approach to inbound traffic control from Mississippi, New Mexico, Texas, and Virginia is designed to minimize cumulative infection and death importation into Arizona over the next 8 weeks. By tailoring strategies to each state's epidemic profile and travel volume, we balance the epidemic-mobility trade-off efficiently. States with moderate infection prevalence but lower travel volume (Mississippi, Virginia) use strict-first-then-relaxed policies to contain early importation risk while allowing later mobility. New Mexico, with high infectious prevalence and substantial travel, uses a relaxed-first-then-strict strategy to accommodate essential mobility early and strengthen controls later as data informs Arizona's epidemic trajectory. Texas, with high flow but moderate prevalence, adopts a mid-strict approach to moderate risk throughout, reflecting its critical economic ties. Quantitatively, this strategy ensemble reduces expected imported infectious cases by applying low fractions (strict controls) during high-risk periods and states, thus lowering Flow * ft * (I/pop) contributions. Cooperation across states ensures risk is balanced temporally and spatially, preventing overwhelming Arizona's healthcare system. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more critical, especially for high-flow states like Texas and New Mexico. Conversely, if prevalence declines, a shift toward relaxed strategies could preserve mobility without compromising health. This calibrated, data-driven policy suite provides robust epidemic control while respecting essential mobility, thereby safeguarding Arizona's public health and socio-economic stability."
