The infection import risk is proportional to flow * fraction * (I/pop), so despite low prevalence, the massive flow can lead to significant imported infections. Selecting a strict-first-then-relaxed strategy (S1) allows New Mexico to initially curb inflow strictly when risks are higher, reducing early imported infections and deaths, then gradually relaxes controls to preserve essential mobility later. This balances epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs. The large absolute flow from Arizona and its moderate infectious prevalence justify a cautious initial restriction to prevent seeding outbreaks in New Mexico, which has a substantial exposed (E=14,647) and infected (I=7,425) population already. Over time, as New Mexico's epidemic stabilizes or declines, relaxing controls will facilitate essential movement without significant risk. This phased approach is epidemiologically sound for managing a source with sizable population and moderate infection prevalence."

Hence, a relaxed-first-then-strict (S2) strategy is appropriate to permit initial higher mobility, supporting economic and social interactions, while gradually tightening controls in later weeks as a precautionary measure if any risk signals increase.

The infection import risk is significant given the large flow and moderate infectious ratio. Applying a strict-first-then-relaxed (S1) strategy is critical to mitigate the immediate risk of importing infections, which could exacerbate New Mexico's already considerable exposed and infected populations. Stringent early controls can substantially reduce importation of cases, preventing surges in new infections.

The mid-strict strategy (S4) balances moderate control throughout the 8 weeks with a slight emphasis on initial and final weeks, curbing potential importation without overly restricting mobility.

  },
  "global_guidance": "The adopted strategy across all origin states is S1_strict_first_then_relaxed, reflecting a conservative public health approach that emphasizes early strict controls on inbound mobility to New Mexico. This uniform strategy is justified by the high absolute infection counts and/or large inbound flows from major origin states, particularly Texas and Arizona, which present the greatest risk of importing infections. Early stringent restrictions reduce the number of imported infected individuals significantly by minimizing the product of inbound flow, fraction of allowed flow, and infection prevalence (I/population). As weeks progress and local epidemic conditions potentially improve or immunity accrues, the strategy gradually relaxes to restore essential travel and economic activity. This balances the epidemic-mobility tradeoff by frontloading restrictions when importation risk is highest and tapering off as risk diminishes. The collective effect is to reduce cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in New Mexico by limiting early seeding events while preserving necessary mobility. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase unexpectedly, the early strict controls provide a buffer to contain outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, the gradual relaxation allows for timely resumption of mobility without significant epidemic resurgence. Coordination across states with similar temporal allocation patterns ensures balanced risk distribution over time, avoiding spikes in imported infections. This approach is robust, adaptable, and aligns with epidemiological and mobility considerations critical to managing New Mexico's epidemic trajectory."

This uniform strategy is justified by the high absolute infection counts and/or large inbound flows from major origin states, particularly Texas and Arizona, which present the greatest risk of importing infections. Early stringent restrictions reduce the number of imported infected individuals significantly by minimizing the product of inbound flow, fraction of allowed flow, and infection prevalence (I/population). As weeks progress and local epidemic conditions potentially improve or immunity accrues, the strategy gradually relaxes to restore essential travel and economic activity. This balances the epidemic-mobility tradeoff by frontloading restrictions when importation risk is highest and tapering off as risk diminishes. The collective effect is to reduce cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in New Mexico by limiting early seeding events while preserving necessary mobility. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase unexpectedly, the early strict controls provide a buffer to contain outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, the gradual relaxation allows for timely resumption of mobility without significant epidemic resurgence. Coordination across states with similar temporal allocation patterns ensures balanced risk distribution over time, avoiding spikes in imported infections. This approach is robust, adaptable, and aligns with epidemiological and mobility considerations critical to managing New Mexico's epidemic trajectory."
