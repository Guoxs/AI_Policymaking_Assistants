Implementing a strict-first-then-relaxed strategy (S1) balances initial stringent controls to minimize early imported infections while gradually relaxing as the infection risk potentially decreases or Mississippi's internal control improves. This approach reduces immediate pressure on Mississippi's healthcare system and delays seeding from Arizona's cases. The trade-off prioritizes early epidemic suppression through strict early restrictions on travel volumes, accepting lower mobility in the initial weeks but allowing recovery of essential travel later.

The S2 strategy (relaxed-first-then-strict) allows higher traffic fractions early on while ramping up restrictions in later weeks to curb potential epidemic growth as Mississippi's internal epidemic evolves.

Texas, despite low infection prevalence, has a very high inflow that could seed infections if uncontrolled; thus, a relaxed-first-then-strict (S2) strategy is chosen to preserve essential mobility initially while ramping up controls later to respond to epidemic trends. Virginia, with low infection prevalence and moderate flow, is assigned a mid-strict (S4) pattern, balancing steady control and mobility without abrupt restrictions. This cross-state coordinated approach reduces the overall expected imported infections and deaths by front-loading restrictions on higher-risk origins and volumes, while accommodating essential travel needs to maintain economic and social functions.

Early weeks require strict mobility controls to sharply reduce imported infectious individuals, thus preventing seeding and subsequent outbreak amplification in Mississippi. The S1 strategy, emphasizing strict control initially and gradual relaxation, achieves this by strongly limiting inflows when risk is highest and accommodating gradual mobility restoration as the epidemic hopefully wanes. This pattern aligns well with the high initial risk and the need for balancing public health protection with essential movement.

Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas present higher absolute infected counts or inflow volumes, justifying strict early restrictions (S1_strict_first_then_relaxed) to sharply reduce initial imported infections when Mississippi’s local epidemic remains vulnerable. This phased relaxation allows mobility to resume as local control improves, balancing epidemic suppression with economic and social needs. Virginia’s lower infected count and moderate inflow merit a milder mid-strict pattern (S4_mid_strict), preserving essential mobility without unduly risking importation. Quantitatively, the strategy leverages the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/pop), reducing ft (strictness) during periods of high risk and inflow to minimize imported infections. By coordinating timing and stringency across states, the approach evenly distributes importation risk over time, avoiding overwhelming Mississippi’s healthcare capacity. Sensitivity considerations include potential increases in transmission rate (beta) or infection prevalence, which would necessitate earlier or stricter controls, especially from high-risk origins like Texas. Conversely, if prevalence declines or beta reduces, relaxation could accelerate. This adaptable, data-driven policy supports robust epidemic control while preserving vital interstate mobility essential for Mississippi’s societal and economic resilience."

    "notes": "Arizona presents a moderately high epidemic risk characterized by a substantial infected population (I=1378) relative to its total population (~7.1 million susceptible). The ratio of infected individuals to total population is low, but the absolute number of infected and exposed (E=4254) is still significant. The average daily inbound flow from Arizona to Mississippi is roughly 2118 individuals, which, when combined with the infection prevalence, implies a non-negligible risk of importing new cases. Using the quantitative logic, imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/pop), the infected fraction is about 0.000193, which when multiplied by the flow and fraction control ft, can lead to imported infections. Given this, a stricter control in the initial weeks is justified to suppress early importation risk, thus the chosen 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' pattern is appropriate. This strategy applies tighter restrictions initially (low ft values) to minimize early imported cases and gradually relaxes controls to balance economic and social mobility needs. This approach aligns well with Arizona's moderate but tangible epidemic risk and the need to protect Mississippi from an influx of infections while preserving essential mobility over time."

    "notes": "New Mexico shows a high epidemic risk with a notably large exposed (E=35965) and infected (I=19809) population relative to its total population (~1.55 million susceptible). The infection prevalence (I/pop) is higher here compared to other states, indicating a significant risk of disease importation into Mississippi via daily inbound flow (~978 people). Using the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/pop), the potential for importing infected individuals is high, demanding a cautious approach. The 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy, which enforces strict travel controls during the initial weeks, is optimal to reduce early importation risk and prevent seeding new outbreaks in Mississippi. Gradual relaxation over time allows adaptation to changing epidemic conditions and preserves necessary mobility for economic and social activities. This approach balances the high risk posed by New Mexico's infection rates with the need for sustainable travel policies."

    "notes": "Texas, with a very large population and a moderate number of infected individuals (I=4125), presents a complex risk profile. Despite the large absolute number of infected, the infection prevalence relative to the population size is low. The inbound flow from Texas to Mississippi is very high (~38,747 daily), which significantly increases the risk of imported infections. The imported infection estimate (Flow * ft * (I/pop)) is substantial even with moderate ft values. Thus, a strategy that applies moderately strict controls during the middle weeks (S4_mid_strict) is selected to address the risk effectively. This U-shaped pattern with higher restrictions in the middle weeks corresponds to expected epidemic dynamics and allows for maintaining some mobility early and late while controlling peak risk periods. It balances the need to mitigate the spread from a high-flow origin state with preserving essential travel and economic activity."

    "notes": "Virginia shows a relatively low infected population (I=616) and exposed (E=2323) compared to its susceptible population (~8.4 million). The infection prevalence is low, and while the daily inbound flow (~4289) is moderate, the overall risk of importing infections is comparatively smaller. Given this, a uniform traffic control strategy (S3_uniform) is appropriate, applying consistent moderate control over the entire 8-week period. This avoids unnecessary disruption while maintaining steady vigilance against potential imported cases. The uniform approach balances epidemic risk and mobility needs without the extremes of strict or relaxed phases, suitable for a low-to-moderate risk state like Virginia."
  },
  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic control strategy for Mississippi prioritizes minimizing imported infections by tailoring controls to each origin state's epidemic risk and mobility patterns. States with higher infection prevalence and significant inbound flows (New Mexico, Arizona, Texas) are assigned stricter or mid-strict strategies initially or during peak risk weeks to suppress early and mid-period importation of cases. This reduces the cumulative seeding of infections in Mississippi, which can exacerbate local outbreaks. Lower-risk states like Virginia receive uniform moderate controls to sustain essential travel while maintaining epidemic vigilance. The approach balances epidemiological risk and socio-economic mobility by applying dynamic fraction allocations, emphasizing stricter early controls when importation risk and epidemic growth potential are greatest. Quantitatively, this coordinated control scheme lowers the expected imported infected cases by adjusting the ft multipliers in the imported_infected formula, thereby reducing secondary transmission and mortality. Sensitivity analyses suggest that changes in infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) would shift the optimal timing and rigidity of controls, but the principle of prioritizing stricter controls from high-prevalence origins remains robust. This strategy fosters cooperative multi-state risk management, ensuring Mississippi's epidemic control efforts are efficient, adaptive, and balanced against essential mobility needs."
