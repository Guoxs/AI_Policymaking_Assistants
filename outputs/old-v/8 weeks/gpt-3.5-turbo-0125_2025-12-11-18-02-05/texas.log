The infected proportion I/S is approximately 0.00131, suggesting a significant potential for importing infections into Texas via inbound mobility. Given the high average past 21-day inflow (27,907) and future 56-day baseline inbound flow (28,201.62), the imported infection risk is quantitatively estimated as proportional to Flow * ft * (I/pop). Implementing a stricter control initially (S1 pattern) reduces flow fractions in early weeks, curbing early importation of infections when the epidemic risk is highest, and relaxing controls later as the local epidemic in Texas stabilizes. This strategy balances the epidemic risk against mobility needs, preventing overwhelming Texas healthcare resources early while allowing gradual resumption of essential mobility. Therefore, S1 is optimal for Arizona's risk profile."

The exposed (E=2000) also contributes to potential latent infection import risk. The inbound flow from Mississippi is significant (18,479 past, 31,557.62 projected), which could introduce new infections to Texas. Given these factors, a strategy with stricter early restrictions (S1) minimizes risk during the critical early weeks, allowing Texas to manage imported cases better. As local conditions improve or adapt, controls can be relaxed to accommodate essential mobility. This approach balances epidemic control with economic and social needs effectively for Mississippi."

Employing a strict-first then relaxed strategy (S1) mitigates early transmission risk by substantially limiting early-week flows, which is crucial given the high mobility volumes. This approach helps reduce the exponential growth potential of imported infections during the sensitive early period of an outbreak in Texas, while allowing gradual reopening.

A mid_strict pattern (S4) balances epidemic control and mobility: it applies moderately strict control in the middle weeks when risk might peak but allows higher flows at start and end. This strategy suits Virginia’s profile by avoiding excessive early disruption while still addressing mid-period risks, reflecting a balanced epidemic-mobility trade-off."

The inflow into Texas from Arizona is substantial (33,250.33 daily). Calculating the infected fraction (I/population) gives approximately 4.96e-5, indicating a moderate risk of importing infections. Using the logic imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/pop), the inbound flow combined with moderate prevalence poses a considerable risk to Texas. Therefore, a strict-first-then-relaxed strategy is chosen to minimize infections early on when the impact of imported cases could amplify local outbreaks.

The mid-strict strategy was chosen to balance epidemic risk with mobility needs. This strategy imposes moderately strict controls, especially in mid-period weeks, which aligns with the infection dynamics to suppress potential importation peaks while maintaining some mobility.

States with higher infection and exposure prevalence and larger inflows (New Mexico, Arizona, Mississippi) are assigned strict-first-then-relaxed strategies to curtail early importation peaks when infection risk is highest. This early strictness reduces the effective reproduction number in Texas by limiting imported cases during initial critical weeks. For Virginia, with low relative prevalence and smaller inflow, a mid-strict strategy is chosen to avoid unnecessary economic and social disruption while still mitigating risk. Quantitatively, the imported infections are proportional to the product of inflow, infection prevalence, and weekly traffic fractions. By front-loading strict controls on high-risk states, the strategy reduces the highest-risk importation periods, while gradually relaxing controls preserves mobility and economic activity in later weeks. This cooperative approach distributes risk mitigation efforts efficiently across states and weeks, optimizing overall epidemic control. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls yield more benefit, while lower prevalence could justify more relaxed patterns.

For Virginia, with low relative prevalence and smaller inflow, a mid-strict strategy is chosen to avoid unnecessary economic and social disruption while still mitigating risk. Quantitatively, the imported infections are proportional to the product of inflow, infection prevalence, and weekly traffic fractions. By front-loading strict controls on high-risk states, the strategy reduces the highest-risk importation periods, while gradually relaxing controls preserves mobility and economic activity in later weeks. This cooperative approach distributes risk mitigation efforts efficiently across states and weeks, optimizing overall epidemic control. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls yield more benefit, while lower prevalence could justify more relaxed patterns. This adaptive approach ensures robust epidemic containment while supporting essential cross-state mobility essential for Texas's economy and public services."

The proportion of infectious individuals (I/pop) is low, reducing immediate importation risk. However, the high average daily inbound flow (49809.1) to Texas presents a non-negligible risk of importing cases. Given the relatively stable epidemic state but significant mobility, a strategy that starts with stricter control (low fractions in the early weeks) is prudent to rapidly reduce potential imported infections while gradually relaxing controls as risk potentially diminishes. This approach balances epidemic mitigation with mobility needs, minimizing sudden disruptions while controlling the initial importation risk. The strict-first-then-relaxed strategy (S1) fits well, ensuring early weeks have the lowest fractions (0.05 to 0.11), thereby reducing imported infected cases from Arizona when it matters most."

The inbound flow to Texas is moderate (60331.38), which combined with the exposed population suggests a risk of rising importation. Therefore, a cautious approach with initial strict controls to suppress early-week imports is appropriate. The S1 strategy (strict first then relaxed) helps limit early introduction of infections from Mississippi, giving Texas time to manage any spillover cases. This balances the epidemic risk and economic mobility, protecting Texas from potentially underestimated infection growth in Mississippi."

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy across origin states balances the epidemic control needs with maintaining essential mobility to Texas. States with moderate infection prevalence and significant mobility, such as Arizona and Mississippi, are assigned a strict-first-then-relaxed strategy (S1) to quickly curb importation risk in early weeks while easing later. For New Mexico, with the highest infection prevalence and largest inbound flow, a relaxed-first-then-strict strategy (S2) is applied, accommodating immediate mobility demands but tightening controls progressively to reduce importation risk. Virginia, with low prevalence and moderate flow, employs a mid-strict strategy (S4) to maintain balanced controls. This cross-state allocation reduces the cumulative imported infections by frontloading restrictions on higher-risk origins and scheduling gradual relaxation where appropriate. Quantitatively, imported infected individuals roughly scale with inbound flow * fraction * (I/pop), so adjusting fractions week-by-week and state-by-state helps minimize total imported infections and deaths in Texas. The cooperation logic involves staggered timing of restrictions to avoid simultaneous high inflows from multiple sources, thus smoothing demand on Texas’s healthcare system. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rates increase in certain states, stricter or earlier implementation of controls would further reduce risk. Conversely, if mobility baselines decrease, more relaxed strategies could be considered to enhance economic activity without significantly increasing epidemiological risk. This plan ensures adaptive, evidence-based traffic control policies that collectively mitigate epidemic spread while preserving critical mobility."

The infected to susceptible ratio is relatively low (~0.00024), but the high absolute numbers and substantial average daily inflow to Texas (48,046) pose a non-negligible risk of importing infections. The imported infected count can be roughly estimated as Inflow * fraction * (I / population), which suggests that early weeks with stricter controls (low fractions) will more effectively reduce initial infection importation. Arizona's relatively high Q numbers (163,279) indicate ongoing case detection and control efforts, but significant mobility warrants strict control initially. Choosing the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy allows Texas to minimize imported infections in the critical first weeks when initial seeding could lead to outbreaks, then gradually relax controls to balance essential mobility. This approach prioritizes epidemic control early on while recognizing the need for economic and social mobility in later weeks."

The average daily inflow from Mississippi to Texas (60,330) is significant relative to state population sizes, thus posing a risk for infection importation. The estimated imported infected cases, calculated as inflow * fraction * (I / population), justify a cautious approach. A strict-first strategy reduces early-week importation risk when Texas is still vulnerable to new infections seeding spread. Mississippi's quarantine numbers (19,330) suggest ongoing containment, but given the exposed and infected numbers, early strict control is prudent.

However, New Mexico also has a large quarantined population (44,277), indicating active case isolation. Given these conditions, a relaxed control early on could allow essential mobility to continue without abruptly disrupting flows, while the gradually increasing strictness (lower fractions in later weeks) can effectively reduce infection risk as Texas’s own epidemic dynamics evolve. The 'S2_relaxed_first_then_strict' strategy thus aligns with the need to initially maintain mobility for economic and social reasons, then ramp up controls to curb infection importation as transmission dynamics shift."
