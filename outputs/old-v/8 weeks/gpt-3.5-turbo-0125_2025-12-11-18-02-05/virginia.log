  "global_guidance": "In designing inbound traffic control policies for Virginia, the key global objective is to minimize the cumulative imported infections and consequent disease spread by leveraging differentiated control strategies based on each origin state's epidemic risk and mobility baseline. States with high infected proportions and moderate to high flow, such as New Mexico and Arizona, warrant early strict control (S1 strategy) to curb the initial importation of infectious individuals, which is critical in suppressing outbreak seeding in Virginia. Mississippi, with moderate infected prevalence and moderate flow, also benefits from a strict-first-then-relaxed approach to protect early weeks while allowing gradual mobility restoration. Texas, despite higher inbound flow, has a moderate infection prevalence, justifying a mid-strict pattern (S4) that avoids overly stringent early restrictions but maintains control during mid-periods of potentially higher risk. This cross-state risk balancing effectively reduces the overall imported infection risk by prioritizing stricter controls where infection prevalence and inbound flow converge to highest risk, while preserving essential socio-economic mobility in lower-risk or high-flow states through more nuanced temporal allocation. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter and possibly longer-duration controls would be warranted, potentially shifting strategies toward more front-loaded strictness or uniform low inflow. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or immunity rises, more relaxed or uniform strategies could be safely applied. The chosen strategies reflect a comprehensive balance between epidemic control and mobility preservation, optimizing Virginia’s health and economic outcomes over the next 8 weeks."

States with high infected proportions and moderate to high flow, such as New Mexico and Arizona, warrant early strict control (S1 strategy) to curb the initial importation of infectious individuals, which is critical in suppressing outbreak seeding in Virginia. Mississippi, with moderate infected prevalence and moderate flow, also benefits from a strict-first-then-relaxed approach to protect early weeks while allowing gradual mobility restoration. Texas, despite higher inbound flow, has a moderate infection prevalence, justifying a mid-strict pattern (S4) that avoids overly stringent early restrictions but maintains control during mid-periods of potentially higher risk. This cross-state risk balancing effectively reduces the overall imported infection risk by prioritizing stricter controls where infection prevalence and inbound flow converge to highest risk, while preserving essential socio-economic mobility in lower-risk or high-flow states through more nuanced temporal allocation. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter and possibly longer-duration controls would be warranted, potentially shifting strategies toward more front-loaded strictness or uniform low inflow. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or immunity rises, more relaxed or uniform strategies could be safely applied. The chosen strategies reflect a comprehensive balance between epidemic control and mobility preservation, optimizing Virginia’s health and economic outcomes over the next 8 weeks."

The infected-to-population ratio suggests a moderate risk of importing active infections via mobility. Given Arizona's large average daily inflow into Virginia (5763.29), the expected imported infections can be approximated as inflow * fraction * (I/S). Prioritizing strict control measures early (S1 strategy) reduces initial importation, curbing potential amplification in Virginia. This strict-first-then-relaxed pattern balances epidemiological risk by imposing tighter restrictions when risk is highest, then easing to re-enable essential mobility later, thus supporting economic and social needs. The trade-off reflects an emphasis on initial epidemic containment while gradually restoring flow as Arizona’s epidemic curve potentially improves or Virginia’s immunity increases."

The infection import logic (inflow * fraction * I/S) suggests that controlling inbound traffic early is critical to prevent seeding infections in Virginia. The S1 strategy’s strict-first-then-relaxed approach effectively mitigates risk during peak exposure while allowing relaxation as the situation stabilizes, aligning with the need to balance public health priorities and mobility demands. Early strict control reduces initial imported cases, minimizing secondary spread risks, while later relaxation supports economic continuity."

The infection-import estimate (inflow * fraction * I/S) is moderated by the smaller flow, allowing a more relaxed initial policy to maintain essential mobility, especially as New Mexico might be experiencing a declining epidemic phase or effective local controls. The S2 strategy (relaxed-first-then-strict) delays stringent controls, allowing mobility to support economic activity initially, then tightening as Virginia’s capacity to handle imported cases might be challenged or New Mexico’s epidemic worsens. This approach balances risk and mobility given the state's epidemic intensity but lower flow."

Applying the infection-import formula (inflow * fraction * I/S), the magnitude of flow combined with a non-negligible prevalence demands strict early control to reduce imported infections to Virginia. The S1 strategy’s strict-first-then-relaxed pattern is optimal to minimize initial seeding infections, allowing later relaxation to accommodate essential mobility and economic connections between Texas and Virginia. This approach prioritizes early epidemic risk reduction while considering the socio-economic importance of mobility."

  "global_guidance": "The collective strategy selection reflects a calibrated approach to managing epidemic importation risk while preserving essential mobility. States with larger infected populations and higher inflow volumes to Virginia, such as Arizona and Texas, are assigned strict-first-then-relaxed strategies (S1), ensuring strong early controls to reduce the seeding of infections. Mississippi, with moderate infection prevalence and sizable inflow, also follows S1 for early containment. New Mexico, despite high prevalence, has a relatively low inflow; hence, a reversed strategy (S2) with relaxed initial control shifting to stricter later control balances mobility and risk effectively. This cross-state cooperation logic balances epidemic risk by timing restrictions to when they are most epidemiologically effective. Early strict measures reduce cumulative imported infections and downstream transmission, while later relaxation supports socio-economic recovery. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter or longer early controls would be necessary, particularly for states with high flow volumes.
