The infected ratio (I/pop) is approximately 0.0005, implying a non-negligible risk of importing cases. The inbound flow from Mississippi into Arizona is modest (avg ~1586 daily). Applying the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/pop), the risk is moderate but manageable. The 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy, which imposes stricter controls initially and relaxes over time, is suitable here. Early strict control reduces immediate imported infection risk while allowing gradual reopening as the situation improves or as Arizona's internal conditions stabilize. This balances reducing imported cases with preserving essential mobility, especially since Mississippi's epidemic indicators are not severe but not negligible either. Mobility is preserved progressively, supporting economic and social needs."

Virginia, with low prevalence and moderate flow, uses a uniform strategy to maintain steady control without undue restrictions.\n\nThis cross-state risk balancing reduces overall imported infections by prioritizing early and strict controls where risk is highest, while preserving mobility where risk is lower. Quantitatively, the fraction allocations modulate the daily imported infected individuals as Flow * ft * (I/pop), lowering early-week inflows from high-risk states. The allocation patterns also consider epidemic dynamics over time, allowing relaxation as conditions improve.\n\nSensitivity to parameters such as the transmission rate beta or changes in infected prevalence could shift optimal strategies. For example, an increase in beta or a surge in infections in any origin state would warrant stricter early controls or switching to a strict-first pattern. Conversely, a decline in prevalence could allow more relaxed early mobility. Continuous monitoring and adaptive strategy adjustments are essential to respond to evolving epidemic scenarios, ensuring Arizona's epidemic control policies remain effective while supporting critical mobility."

States with higher infection prevalence and significant inflows, such as New Mexico and Mississippi, receive the strict-first-then-relaxed pattern, front-loading restrictions to curb early seeding risks. Texas, with a large population and high flow but moderate prevalence, is assigned a mid-strict pattern to balance epidemic control with essential mobility. Virginia, with low prevalence and moderate flow, uses a uniform strategy to maintain steady control without undue restrictions.\n\nThis cross-state risk balancing reduces overall imported infections by prioritizing early and strict controls where risk is highest, while preserving mobility where risk is lower. Quantitatively, the fraction allocations modulate the daily imported infected individuals as Flow * ft * (I/pop), lowering early-week inflows from high-risk states. The allocation patterns also consider epidemic dynamics over time, allowing relaxation as conditions improve.\n\nSensitivity to parameters such as the transmission rate beta or changes in infected prevalence could shift optimal strategies. For example, an increase in beta or a surge in infections in any origin state would warrant stricter early controls or switching to a strict-first pattern. Conversely, a decline in prevalence could allow more relaxed early mobility. Continuous monitoring and adaptive strategy adjustments are essential to respond to evolving epidemic scenarios, ensuring Arizona's epidemic control policies remain effective while supporting critical mobility."

The infected ratio is approximately 0.0076%, which combined with a moderate inflow to Arizona (~2444 daily) suggests a risk of introducing infected individuals into Arizona. Using the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/pop), the imported infection risk is moderate but non-negligible. Given this, a stricter control in the initial weeks (low fractions) is justified to reduce early imported infections when Arizona's epidemic state is still sensitive. The strategy then relaxes control gradually allowing essential mobility later when risk may be lower or Arizona's internal control improves. This balances disease control and mobility needs, ensuring that initial imported cases are minimized to prevent seeding new outbreaks in Arizona."

The infected ratio is about 0.34%, which is substantially higher than Mississippi's, and the inflow to Arizona is also very high (~41,259 daily). This combination results in a considerable risk of imported infections, potentially fueling Arizona's epidemic. Applying a strict control in the early weeks is critical to reduce the importation of infected persons and prevent exacerbation of Arizona's caseload. The gradual relaxation allows for economic and social activities to resume once the immediate threat is mitigated and Arizona's own control measures take effect. This approach prioritizes epidemic control early on while allowing essential mobility later, minimizing overall disease burden."

The infected ratio is low (~0.007%), but the absolute inflow to Arizona is very high (~57,131 daily), which increases the total imported infection risk. However, Texas's relatively lower prevalence compared to its population suggests that immediate strict restrictions might overly constrain mobility without proportional epidemic benefit. The relaxed-first then strict strategy allows maintaining mobility early when risk per traveler is low, but tightens control later in the 8 weeks to prevent delayed importation and account for possible epidemic fluctuations. This balances the necessity of high mobility from Texas with the need to mitigate cumulative imported infections over time."

This strategy applies moderate restrictions in the middle weeks, reflecting a balanced approach that reduces risk while preserving essential flow.

This approach fits Virginia's profile well, managing risk without overburdening mobility."

  "global_guidance": "The overall inbound allocation strategy for Arizona prioritizes minimizing imported infections from states with higher infection prevalence and large inflows while balancing the socioeconomic need for mobility. For states like New Mexico and Mississippi with higher infected ratios or significant inflows, strict-first strategies reduce early importation risk, allowing Arizona to stabilize and reduce secondary transmissions. Texas, despite its large inflow, has a lower prevalence, so a relaxed-first then strict approach balances early economic mobility with later tightening to prevent late surges. Virginia's low prevalence and moderate flow justify a mid-strict approach, maintaining essential flow with moderate risk control. Collectively, these strategies reduce the cumulative imported infected load by concentrating strict controls where risk is highest and timing restrictions to epidemic dynamics. The cooperation logic ensures that states with high prevalence and high inflow receive earlier and more severe restrictions, while others are managed to preserve mobility and prevent economic disruption. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become more critical, especially for high-flow states. Conversely, reduced prevalence or effective vaccination may allow more relaxed strategies. This balanced, data-driven approach aims to minimize Arizona's epidemic burden while preserving essential interstate mobility and economic function."
