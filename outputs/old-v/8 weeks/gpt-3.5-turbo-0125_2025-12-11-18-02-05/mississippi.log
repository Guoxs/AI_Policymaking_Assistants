States with higher infection prevalence and moderate to high inbound flow (Arizona, Virginia) are assigned strict-first strategies (S1) to suppress initial importation risk, critical for curbing early outbreaks. New Mexico, with moderate prevalence and flow, receives a mid-strict pattern (S4) that balances control with mobility, focusing on mid-period risk. Texas, despite high flow, has low infection prevalence and thus adopts a relaxed-first strategy (S2) to preserve mobility early while preparing for potential tightening later. This cross-state calibration of strategies leverages epidemiological data (I and S) and mobility baselines to allocate restrictions where they most reduce risk, while avoiding unnecessary mobility suppression that could harm economic and social well-being. Quantitatively, the use of fraction vectors modulates imported infected cases weekly by scaling daily flow and prevalence, allowing dynamic risk management aligned with infection trends. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) rise in any origin state, stricter early controls become more critical to prevent seeding outbreaks in Mississippi. Conversely, if prevalence falls or vaccination improves, relaxed strategies could be expanded to enhance mobility. This adaptive, data-driven approach ensures balanced epidemic control and mobility preservation across states and time, optimizing public health outcomes for Mississippi.'

Given the moderate prevalence of infection and potential risk of importing cases, a strategy that starts with strict controls (lower fractions in initial weeks) then gradually relaxes is appropriate. This will reduce the immediate risk of introducing infections to Mississippi during the critical early weeks when local cases could spike. The imported infected estimate is proportional to flow * fraction * (I/pop), and since Arizona's I/pop ratio is modest, early strict control helps reduce cumulative risk.

Although the inbound flow to Mississippi is relatively low (1605.76 per day), the high infection prevalence poses a substantial risk of importing cases. Using the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/pop), the initial weeks require strict control to reduce imported infection risk. The chosen strategy S1_strict_first_then_relaxed applies low flow fractions initially, curbing early imported infections while allowing gradual reopening. This approach balances epidemic risk against mobility needs, ensuring Mississippi's health system is not overwhelmed by imported cases from this high-risk state."

The infection prevalence is moderate, but the inbound flow to Mississippi is very high (37,844.24 per day), making it the most significant source of potential imported infections. The large flow combined with infection prevalence means imported infections could be substantial if unrestricted. Applying a strict-first strategy reduces the early weeks' flow fractions, minimizing initial imported infections during Mississippi's vulnerable period. The gradual relaxation allows increased mobility in later weeks as local mitigation measures take effect. This strategy carefully manages the epidemic-mobility tradeoff, prioritizing health safety given Texas' overwhelming flow volume."

The inbound flow to Mississippi from Virginia is moderate (4459.81 per day). The low infection prevalence and moderate flow suggest a balanced risk profile. A uniform strategy distributes flow equally over the 8 weeks, avoiding abrupt changes that may cause economic disruption. This approach maintains stable mobility while controlling epidemic risk, as the imported infection risk is comparatively low. The uniform pattern balances tradeoffs, ensuring neither overly strict early restrictions nor excessive early relaxation, suitable for Virginia's moderate risk profile."

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic control strategy balances epidemic risk reduction and mobility preservation by applying differentiated strategies based on each origin state's infection prevalence and flow volume. States with higher infection levels and/or larger flows (Texas, New Mexico, Arizona) receive the S1_strict_first_then_relaxed pattern, emphasizing lower inbound flow fractions in early weeks to curb imported infections during Mississippi's vulnerable period. Conversely, Virginia's lower infection prevalence and moderate flow justify a uniform flow allocation, maintaining steady mobility without amplifying epidemic risk. This cross-state reasoning leverages quantitative infection-import logic: imported_infections ~ Flow * ft * (I/pop), ensuring that the largest contributors to imported cases are tightly controlled initially. Risk balancing across weeks and states reduces cumulative cases and deaths by preventing early influxes of infection while allowing gradual reopening aligned with local epidemic progression. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early control (even lower ft) would be necessary, especially for high-flow, high-prevalence states, to prevent surges in imported cases. Conversely, if prevalence drops, relaxation can accelerate. The chosen strategies reflect this dynamic balancing act, protecting Mississippi's population health while sustaining essential economic and social connectivity with origin states."

    "notes": "Arizona's epidemic profile shows a moderate infected population (I=1713) relative to its large susceptible base (S=7,080,470). The exposed count (E=5221) suggests ongoing transmission, and the confirmed cases (Q=163,279) are substantial. The average daily inbound flow into Mississippi from Arizona is 2,268.76, which could potentially import infections. The imported infected cases roughly estimate as Flow * fraction * (I/Population). Arizona's relatively high infected proportion, combined with moderate flow, justifies a stricter control at the beginning to reduce early importation risk. Hence, the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy is chosen, minimizing flow in early weeks to suppress introductions while gradually relaxing to balance mobility needs later. This approach carefully manages the epidemic-mobility trade-off by front-loading restrictions when risk is highest, protecting Mississippi's population during critical weeks."

    "notes": "New Mexico presents a significantly higher infected count (I=19,797) and a large exposed pool (E=37,666) relative to its susceptible population (S=1,455,263), indicating a higher epidemic risk than other origin states. The confirmed cases (Q=44,277) and death toll (D=1,830) further confirm active transmission. The average daily inbound flow to Mississippi is 1,671.71, a moderate volume that, combined with high infection prevalence, poses a strong importation risk. Using the imported infected estimate (Flow * fraction * (I/Pop)), the potential for seeding outbreaks in Mississippi is significant if relaxed measures are used early. Therefore, the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy is recommended, imposing strong inbound restrictions initially to sharply cut imported infections. This cautiously balances essential mobility by easing restrictions later, enhancing community safety and reducing epidemic spread from a high-risk origin."

    "notes": "Texas has a large susceptible population (S=28,421,605) and a moderate infected count (I=3,866) with relatively low exposed (E=12,199) compared to population size, suggesting controlled but ongoing transmission. The confirmed cases (Q=173,677) and deaths (D=21,655) are significant but the infection prevalence (I/population) is lower than New Mexico's. Importantly, Texas has a very high average daily inbound flow into Mississippi (34,797.24), representing a major mobility artery. Given the high volume but moderate prevalence, a balanced approach is needed to maintain essential traffic while controlling importation. The 'S5_mid_relaxed' strategy, which applies moderate restrictions mid-period and relatively relaxed measures early and late, optimizes the epidemic-mobility trade-off. This pattern reduces peak importation risk without unduly restricting movement, allowing vital economic and social connectivity while managing risk prudently."

Confirmed cases (Q=131,318) and deaths (D=3,639) are substantial but infection prevalence is low. The average daily inbound flow to Mississippi is 4,631.1, a moderate mobility volume. The 'S4_mid_strict' strategy, which imposes stricter controls in the middle weeks and moderate restrictions otherwise, fits Virginia's risk profile well. This approach targets periods when imported infection risks may peak, while allowing more relaxed flow initially and later to preserve essential mobility connections. This balances epidemic control and mobility needs, preventing importation spikes while maintaining steady traffic flow."

  "global_guidance": "The overall inbound traffic control strategy for Mississippi balances epidemic risk reduction and essential mobility preservation by tailoring weekly traffic allocations per origin state based on infection prevalence, exposed populations, and mobility volumes. States with higher infection rates and notable exposed populations (New Mexico, Arizona) receive stricter controls early (S1_strict_first_then_relaxed) to sharply reduce imported infections during high-risk periods. This front-loaded approach effectively dampens imported seeding potential when Mississippi is most vulnerable. Texas, with a large susceptible population but moderate infection prevalence and very high inbound flow, is assigned a mid-relaxed strategy (S5_mid_relaxed) that eases early and late restrictions but applies moderate controls mid-term to balance public health and economic connectivity. Virginia, with lower prevalence and moderate flow, is managed with a mid-strict pattern (S4_mid_strict) to fine-tune controls during peak risk weeks while preserving mobility. Collectively, these strategies optimize the distribution of inbound travel to minimize cumulative imported infections and deaths. Quantitatively, imported infections approximate Flow * fraction * (I/population), so early strictness on high prevalence states reduces expected cases substantially. The cooperative logic balances restrictions across weeks and states, preventing excessive burden on any single origin while maintaining essential flows. Sensitivity to prevalence and transmission rates (beta) suggests that if infection rates increase, stricter or more front-loaded controls would become necessary; conversely, if prevalence drops, more relaxed strategies could be employed. This dynamic framework allows adaptive response to evolving epidemic conditions, emphasizing protection of Mississippi’s population while sustaining critical mobility."
