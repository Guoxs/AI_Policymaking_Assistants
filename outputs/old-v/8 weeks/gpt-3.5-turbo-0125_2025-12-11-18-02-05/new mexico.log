The importation risk into New Mexico is proportional to the inflow (19,166.81) and the infected fraction I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D) which is significant. Using the strict-first-then-relaxed strategy (S1) ensures that inbound travel restrictions are strongest in the initial weeks when risk is highest, effectively suppressing early importation of infections.

Texas, despite its low infection prevalence, has the highest inbound flow, so a relaxed-first-then-strict strategy (S2) is used to maintain essential mobility upfront but tighten controls later to limit cumulative risk. Mississippi's moderate infection prevalence and low flow favor a uniform strategy (S3) that balances control and mobility consistently. This cross-state approach leverages temporal trade-offs to reduce overall infection seeding in New Mexico by applying stricter controls early where risk is greatest and relaxing later as risk subsides or flows diminish. The load distribution across weeks and states prevents overwhelming New Mexico's containment capacity. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, early strict control strategies yield greater benefit in reducing imported cases, whereas if prevalence decreases, more relaxed or uniform strategies may suffice without compromising safety.

The states of Texas and Arizona present the highest risk due to their higher infected populations combined with large daily inflow volumes. Applying the "S1_strict_first_then_relaxed" strategy to these states prioritizes heavy restrictions in the initial weeks when outbreak control is most critical, reducing early seeding events. This approach then gradually relaxes measures to balance mobility needs as local control improves. Mississippi and Virginia, having lower inflows and infection prevalence, are managed with less stringent strategies. Mississippi\'s uniform approach maintains steady control without unnecessary disruption, while Virginia\'s mid-strict strategy targets moderate control especially during mid-weeks to address incubation risks. Quantitatively, this cross-state strategy collectively reduces expected imported infections by focusing strict controls where the product of infection prevalence and mobility volume is highest, while allowing more relaxed policies where risk is lower. This cooperative allocation of restrictions across states optimizes public health benefits without excessive economic costs. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase in any origin state, stricter early controls would become more critical to prevent importation. Conversely, if prevalence declines or vaccination and other mitigations improve, controls can be relaxed sooner. The allocation patterns selected provide flexibility and robustness to such changes, enabling New Mexico to adapt dynamically to evolving epidemic conditions while preserving essential inbound mobility.'

The expected imported infections can be approximated by Flow * fraction * (I/population), which implies that imposing stricter controls initially (low fractions in early weeks) reduces the early high-risk inflow and thus the immediate risk of seeding infections in New Mexico. The chosen 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy implements stricter controls in the first weeks when risk is higher and gradually relaxes later, balancing disease control with mobility needs. This phased approach helps to mitigate incoming infection pressure from Arizona while allowing economic and social activities to recover in later weeks, reflecting a cautious but adaptive control policy."

The inbound flow to New Mexico from Mississippi is low (1,651 daily) but not negligible. Given the moderate exposure and the potential for latent infections, a conservative approach is warranted to prevent importation of cases during the early weeks when New Mexico's epidemic is still active. The 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy reduces early inflow fractions, thus lowering immediate risk and giving time for surveillance and response capacity to adjust. This approach prioritizes health safety initially, then eases controls to support mobility as the risk diminishes, balancing epidemic control with essential travel and economic considerations."

The inbound flow into New Mexico from Texas is the highest among the origin states (162,187.76 daily), representing a significant source of potential imported infections. Given this substantial flow combined with a sizeable infected population, early strict control is critical to reduce the importation risk. The 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy enforces low initial fractions, limiting early mobility and therefore reducing infectious inflow during New Mexico's vulnerable phase. As weeks progress and local control improves, the policy gradually relaxes to restore mobility. This strategy carefully manages the trade-off between controlling epidemic spread and maintaining essential economic and social connectivity with Texas."

Given the smaller inflow but non-negligible epidemic status, a cautious approach is appropriate to prevent inadvertent case importation. The 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy applies stronger control in the initial weeks, minimizing immediate risk and then progressively relaxing controls to permit mobility as the local epidemic situation improves.

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic control strategy across all origin states favors the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' pattern, emphasizing strong early restrictions followed by gradual relaxation. This approach strategically targets the critical early weeks when New Mexico's local epidemic remains active and vulnerable to new importations. By frontloading strict control, the policy minimizes the initial importation of infected individuals, effectively reducing secondary transmissions within New Mexico. States with high inbound flow and substantial infected populations, such as Texas and Arizona, receive particularly stringent initial control to curb the largest sources of importation risk. Simultaneously, states with lower flows and moderate epidemic levels still adopt strict early controls to maintain a robust barrier against disease spread. This coordinated temporal and cross-state control balances epidemic mitigation with preserving essential economic and social mobility over the 8-week horizon. Quantitatively, this strategy reduces expected imported infections by suppressing high-risk travel periods, thereby flattening the imported infection curve and lessening pressure on New Mexico's healthcare resources. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates rise, maintaining or even intensifying early restrictions would be necessary to sustain control. Conversely, if local or origin state epidemics improve rapidly, the phased relaxation embedded in the strategy allows timely restoration of mobility without compromising safety. Overall, this policy framework provides a dynamic, data-driven, and cooperative approach to managing interstate travel risks while supporting New Mexico's epidemic control goals and mobility needs."

    "notes": "Arizona has a very large population with moderate infection levels (I=1713) and exposed (E=5221) relative to its population of over 7 million. Despite the sizable population, its infection prevalence (I/population) is low (~0.00024), but the absolute number of infected and exposed individuals combined with the extremely high average daily inflow into New Mexico (25478.57) poses a significant risk of importing infections. The importation risk can be approximated as inflow * fraction * (I/population), meaning that even small fractions early on can result in substantial imported infections. Therefore, a strict-first strategy (S1) is justified to strongly limit inbound flow in the initial weeks when cases may surge, gradually relaxing controls later to preserve mobility. This balances the epidemic control by minimizing initial seeding while allowing some recovery of travel for economic and social needs. The high baseline flow necessitates a conservative approach initially to avoid overwhelming New Mexico’s containment capacity."

The infection prevalence (I/population ~0.00027) is similar to Arizona but with much lower baseline inbound flow (1434.48 per day) to New Mexico. Given the lower flow and moderate infection, a mid-strict approach balances risk and mobility effectively. The S4 strategy reduces flow moderately in the middle weeks, providing a buffer during potentially riskier periods while allowing more relaxed flow during initial and later weeks. This approach helps to keep imported infection risk low without overly restricting the essential mobility given the small inflow, preserving economic and social connectivity."

The baseline daily inflow to New Mexico is very low (1808.81). Given the low infection prevalence and flow, a mid-relaxed strategy (S5) is appropriate to allow more mobility in the middle weeks, which fits the low epidemic risk profile. This approach balances the need to maintain essential mobility and economic activity with moderate control measures to prevent any unexpected spikes. The slightly relaxed mid period can support social and economic interactions without significantly increasing imported infection risk."
  },
  "global_guidance": "The overall inbound traffic control strategy for New Mexico prioritizes minimizing imported infections from states with high infection prevalence and large inbound flows, while allowing more relaxed control for states with lower risk and lower flow. Arizona and Texas, with the highest inflows and significant infection counts, are assigned the strict-first strategy (S1) to sharply reduce initial imported infections. This approach leverages front-loading stricter controls to prevent seeding outbreaks early, while easing controls later to restore mobility. Mississippi's lower inflow and moderate infection risk justify a mid-strict strategy (S4) that balances risk reduction with mobility preservation, targeting stricter control during potentially riskier mid-periods. Virginia's low infection prevalence and minimal flow enable a mid-relaxed strategy (S5) to maintain essential mobility without significant epidemic risk. This cross-state allocation optimizes the cumulative importation risk by weighting control stringency according to infection prevalence and flow magnitude, thus minimizing expected infections and deaths in New Mexico. Quantitative cooperation logic involves distributing strict control periods to states with highest risk, avoiding simultaneous peak restrictions that could unduly harm mobility. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter or prolonged controls will be necessary for high-flow states to prevent surge in imported cases. Conversely, lower prevalence or improved local containment could allow more relaxed strategies. Balancing epidemic control and mobility is critical to avoid economic and social disruption while minimizing New Mexico's epidemic burden."
