The exposed population E=962 also suggests ongoing transmission. Given Arizona's very high average past 56-day inflow towards Mississippi (1968 with a large total population inflow of over 12 million), the potential for importing infected individuals remains substantial. Calculating approximate imported infected cases as Flow * ft * (I / Pop), with a high inflow and non-negligible infectious prevalence, requires a cautious approach. Hence, a strict-first-then-relaxed strategy (S1) is appropriate: it frontloads traffic restrictions with very low fractions (0.05 to 0.11) in early weeks to suppress imported infections aggressively when risk is highest, then gradually relaxes controls as local Mississippi conditions stabilize and imported risk potentially decreases. This balances epidemic risk reduction while eventually restoring mobility. This choice prioritizes epidemic control given Arizona's infection levels and high mobility connection to Mississippi."

This elevated infectious burden combined with a decent average past daily inflow of 1997 into Mississippi suggests a significant risk of importing infected cases. The quantitative risk (Flow * ft * I/Pop) is higher than Arizona due to the larger infected proportion (3219 infected out of ~2 million susceptible) and substantial inflow. Therefore, the strict-first-then-relaxed strategy (S1) is again justified to initially impose strong inbound traffic reductions, reducing imported infections when risk is highest. As weeks progress, the policy gradually relaxes to allow more movement, balancing epidemic control and economic mobility. This approach mitigates the higher infection risk from New Mexico by applying early strict control measures."

The quantitative cooperation across states reduces cumulative imported infections by front-loading restrictions where risk is highest and gradually relaxing controls to accommodate economic and social needs. Sensitivity to prevalence and transmission rate (beta) is embedded by adjusting control intensity: higher prevalence or beta would warrant more stringent early controls, while lower values allow more relaxation.

This approach leverages the epidemiological logic that initial weeks are crucial to prevent seeding new outbreaks. For Virginia, with low infection prevalence and moderate inflow, a mid-strict approach balances risk and mobility. The quantitative cooperation across states reduces cumulative imported infections by front-loading restrictions where risk is highest and gradually relaxing controls to accommodate economic and social needs. Sensitivity to prevalence and transmission rate (beta) is embedded by adjusting control intensity: higher prevalence or beta would warrant more stringent early controls, while lower values allow more relaxation. This strategic allocation mitigates risk heterogeneity across states and time, optimally protecting Mississippi's population while preserving essential mobility. If prevalence or transmission dynamics shift, the framework enables adaptive reallocation, emphasizing flexible, data-driven epidemic control policies."

Texas, with a large traveler volume but relatively lower infection prevalence, receives a mid-strict approach to balance the high flow and moderate risk, avoiding abrupt mobility restrictions that could disrupt essential economic activities. Quantitatively, imported infections are proportional to the product of inbound flow, infection prevalence in origin, and the fraction of allowed traffic (ft). By applying stricter controls (lower ft) in early weeks for higher-risk states, Mississippi reduces cumulative imported infections and subsequent local transmission. Conversely, relaxing controls later allows for necessary mobility to resume, supporting economic and social functions. The cross-state coordination balances epidemiological risk and mobility needs, preventing simultaneous high-risk importation peaks from multiple origins. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase in origin states, stricter or prolonged controls become more critical to prevent outbreaks in Mississippi. Conversely, if prevalence declines or vaccination coverage increases, the strategy can shift toward more relaxed allocations without compromising safety. This dynamic allocation approach ensures Mississippi's epidemic control aligns with fluctuating external risks and internal capacities, optimizing public health outcomes and mobility preservation."
