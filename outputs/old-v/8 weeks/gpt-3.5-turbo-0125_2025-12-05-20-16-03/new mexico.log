The S1 strategy, which enforces strict control initially with low fractions and gradually relaxes, best suits this scenario by reducing imported infections during the high-risk early period while restoring mobility later.

    "notes": "Arizona's average population shows a very low infectious prevalence relative to its large susceptible population (I=499 vs. S=7,224,878). The exposed count (E=1,555) also remains low, suggesting a controlled but persistent presence of the virus. The substantial past average inflow into New Mexico (38,931) and the current baseline daily inbound flow (26,987.68) represent a significant mobility channel from Arizona. Given the low infected proportion but high mobility, the risk of importing infections remains non-negligible. Quantitatively, imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/pop), where I/pop for Arizona is approximately 499 / (7,224,878 + others) ~ 6.9e-5. This small ratio can still lead to meaningful imported cases due to large flow. Hence, a strict-first-then-relaxed (S1) strategy is prudent: initially low fractions reduce imported infections sharply during the early high-risk phase, allowing time to monitor and adjust. Relaxation in later weeks balances mobility needs and epidemic control. This phased approach aligns well with Arizona’s moderate infection risk and substantial mobility volume, minimizing disease importation while preserving essential travel as local conditions improve."

Although the infected ratio (I/pop) is low (~9.2e-5), the exposed count indicates potential near-future increases in infections. The average inbound flow to New Mexico is modest both historically and in the current baseline (1,597 historically, 1,229.98 upcoming daily). Given these factors, a cautious approach is warranted. Employing a strict-first-then-relaxed strategy (S1) minimizes early importation risk by limiting incoming flows at the time when exposed individuals may transition to infectious status. This approach prevents seeding of new cases at the early stage and progressively reopens mobility as the risk diminishes. The balance between epidemiological prudence and mobility preservation is essential since Mississippi's flow is relatively low but not negligible, and the exposed population signals an uncertain epidemic trajectory."

The infected proportion is small (~6.9e-5), but due to the massive population and extremely high inbound flow to New Mexico (125,532 historically, 145,428.96 upcoming daily), the absolute number of potentially imported infected individuals is significant. However, given New Mexico's current elevated infected and exposed levels, immediate stringent restrictions on Texas inbound traffic may cause undue disruption to essential mobility and economic activity. Therefore, a relaxed-first-then-strict (S2) strategy is preferred: initially allowing higher fractions to accommodate mobility needs but gradually tightening controls over time as surveillance and mitigation measures intensify. This approach attempts to balance high mobility demands against cumulative infection risks, preventing overwhelming system shocks while still aiming to reduce disease importation in the medium term."

The average inbound flow to New Mexico is low both historically (2,228) and in the upcoming baseline (1,340.16). Given the low prevalence but persistent epidemic potential, a strict-first-then-relaxed pattern (S1) is suitable. This strategy prioritizes early risk mitigation by limiting incoming flows initially to prevent new introductions.

By uniformly applying the S1_strict_first_then_relaxed strategy to all origins, New Mexico front-loads restrictions in the initial weeks, reducing the immediate risk of importing infectious individuals who could seed new outbreaks. This approach leverages the epidemiological principle that early introduction control can significantly lower the epidemic growth rate locally, preventing compounding infections and deaths. The strategy then progressively relaxes controls to restore essential mobility and economic activity, balancing public health with societal needs. Quantitatively, imported infections scale as Flow * fraction * (I/pop); thus, the high-flow states with moderate prevalence warrant stricter early controls, while even low-flow states benefit from early caution due to the non-zero risk of seeding. Cooperation across states is implicit, as restricting inflows early buys time for New Mexico to manage internal cases and vaccination efforts. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter or prolonged controls would be necessary to maintain control. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta reduces (due to vaccination or behavior change), the gradual relaxation embedded in the strategy becomes more appropriate. This balanced approach addresses heterogeneity in risk across origin states while maintaining coherent policy that minimizes cumulative cases and deaths in New Mexico over the next 8 weeks.'

    "notes": "Arizona's past 56-day average shows a relatively low infection prevalence with I=1368 and E=4262 in a large population of over 7 million susceptible individuals. Despite this, Arizona's extremely high average inbound flow to New Mexico (43660.18 daily) poses a significant risk of importing infections. Calculating the approximate imported infected cases as Flow * fraction * (I / population), Arizona's infection density is low but the large flow magnifies the risk. Therefore, a strategy that applies stricter controls initially (lower fractions in early weeks) to suppress early importation risk, then relaxes controls in later weeks as New Mexico's own epidemic evolves, is appropriate. The S1 pattern (strict first then relaxed) effectively balances early epidemic containment with longer-term mobility needs. This approach minimizes initial imported infections when New Mexico's internal state is vulnerable (E=50195, I=27033), while preserving essential cross-border mobility in later weeks to support socio-economic functions."

    "notes": "Mississippi has a moderate infection prevalence with I=636 and E=11067 in a population of approximately 2.8 million susceptible. Its inbound flow to New Mexico is very low (1829.29 daily), making the absolute imported infection risk relatively minor. Given this, a relaxed control initially (high fractions) allows for maintaining essential mobility and economic activity with minimal epidemic risk, while progressively tightening controls in later weeks to respond proactively if New Mexico's epidemic worsens. The S2 pattern (relaxed first then strict) matches this risk profile, balancing low initial risk with precautionary later restrictions. Since Mississippi's contribution to imported infections is small due to low flow and moderate prevalence, this strategy optimizes mobility without significantly increasing epidemic risks."

    "notes": "Texas has a moderate infection prevalence with I=4011 and E=11951 in a large population (~28.5 million susceptibles). The daily inbound flow from Texas to New Mexico is the highest among origin states at 144332.68. This combination yields a substantial risk of importing infections into New Mexico, especially given New Mexico's current elevated exposed (50195) and infected (27033) numbers. Therefore, a strict control strategy at the start is essential to minimize early imported infections, reducing seeding of further spread. The S1 strategy with strict early weeks followed by gradual relaxation balances epidemic control and essential economic mobility. Early strict control reduces cumulative infections and deaths, while later relaxation supports socio-economic recovery as New Mexico's epidemic situation hopefully improves."

    "notes": "Virginia's infection prevalence is low with I=630 and E=2378 against a susceptible population of over 8.4 million. Its inbound flow to New Mexico is minimal (1310.36 daily), implying very low risk of imported infections. Given this, a uniform distribution of traffic allocation over the 8 weeks is justified, ensuring steady essential mobility without overemphasizing either strict or relaxed controls. This approach balances epidemic safety and mobility needs without unnecessary oscillations in restriction intensity. The uniform strategy (S3) also simplifies implementation and ensures consistent policy messaging, appropriate given the low epidemic risk and low flow from Virginia."

  "global_guidance": "The selected strategies collectively minimize imported infections and deaths in New Mexico by tailoring control intensities to each origin state's epidemic risk and inbound flow magnitude. High-flow states with moderate infection prevalence (Arizona and Texas) receive the strict-first-then-relaxed (S1) strategy to suppress early importation risk when New Mexico's epidemic is vulnerable. Low-flow states with moderate prevalence (Mississippi) adopt a relaxed-first-then-strict (S2) strategy, allowing initial mobility while tightening later to buffer against potential epidemic worsening. Very low risk states with minimal flow and infection prevalence (Virginia) use a uniform strategy (S3), balancing safety and mobility consistently. This cross-state approach balances the aggregate imported infection load across weeks, storing strict controls early where risk is highest and relaxing them later as New Mexico's internal epidemic potentially stabilizes. The week-wise allocation fractions sum to 1 per state, ensuring proper control intensity distribution over the 8 weeks. Sensitivity to prevalence or transmission rate changes is addressed by front-loading strict controls on high-risk, high-flow states, which reduces the epidemic seeding potential significantly. If prevalence rises or transmission (beta) increases, the strict-first approach prevents early surges. Conversely, if prevalence falls, uniform or relaxed strategies allow recovery of mobility without severe epidemic consequences. Overall, this coordinated multi-origin state strategy optimizes epidemic containment in New Mexico while preserving essential cross-state mobility."
