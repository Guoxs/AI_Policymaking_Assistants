The proportion of infected individuals (I/S) is approximately 0.000041, indicating a relatively low prevalence. However, Arizona's average daily inbound flow into Texas is quite high (48811.71), making it a significant source of imported infections if not controlled. The importation risk can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I/pop), where ft varies weekly by the chosen strategy. Given the moderate prevalence and high mobility, a strict-first-then-relaxed strategy (S1) is optimal. This approach enforces strict control during the initial weeks, reducing imported infections when the epidemic risk is potentially more impactful, then gradually relaxes restrictions to balance economic and social mobility. This balances minimizing imported infections with preserving essential mobility over time. The phased relaxation allows Texas to monitor and adjust based on epidemic trends while minimizing sudden economic impacts."

With a daily inbound flow of 58434.3 into Texas, the volume is substantial, increasing the potential importation risk. Choosing the strict-first-then-relaxed strategy (S1) helps to aggressively reduce the initial importation risk by imposing stricter controls when the exposed and infected populations might fuel transmission.

Additionally, New Mexico's inbound flow into Texas is large (125533.45 daily), making it the largest contributor to potential infection importation. Given this high risk, one might expect stricter controls initially. However, New Mexico's epidemic dynamics and potential socio-economic factors may warrant a different approach. The relaxed-first-then-strict strategy (S2) allows mobility initially to accommodate essential flow and economic interactions, but progressively tightens restrictions to reduce risk as more data on epidemic trends emerge or as Texas's own epidemic state changes. This phased tightening can also account for possible reporting delays or initial underestimation of risk. This strategy balances the high infection risk with the necessity to maintain some level of essential mobility early on while preparing for stronger controls if needed."

Given the moderate risk and mobility volume, the strict-first-then-relaxed strategy (S1) is appropriate.

States with moderate infection prevalence and significant inbound flows (Arizona, Mississippi, Virginia) adopt the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy, imposing stricter controls early to reduce initial importation risk when local Texas epidemic burden is still sensitive to external seeding. This approach mitigates early importation spikes, reducing secondary transmission and mortality downstream. New Mexico, with the highest infection prevalence and inflow, employs 'S2_relaxed_first_then_strict' to initially preserve essential mobility and supply chains critical for Texas' economy and healthcare logistics, while progressively tightening controls to mitigate sustained importation risk. This staggered approach reflects a nuanced trade-off between epidemic control and socio-economic needs. Quantitatively, this risk-balancing strategy leverages the infection prevalence ratios (I/pop) and flow volumes to allocate inbound traffic fractions optimally across weeks, minimizing expected imported infected individuals = Flow * ft * (I/pop). Sensitivity to prevalence or transmission rate (beta) changes would shift the optimal balance; higher beta or prevalence would favor more frontloaded restrictions (S1), while lower risk or greater mobility needs might justify relaxed early periods (S2 or S5). Coordinated cross-state strategies reduce overall epidemic pressure on Texas by smoothing importation risks temporally and geographically, enabling targeted interventions without blanket restrictions.

High-risk states with elevated infection prevalence and/or large inbound flows, notably New Mexico, Arizona, and Mississippi, are assigned the 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy to impose strong early restrictions, mitigating immediate epidemic risks. This early strict control is critical as imported infections can catalyze local outbreaks, increasing cumulative cases and deaths. Virginia, with lower prevalence and moderate flow, is managed with a 'mid-strict' strategy that balances the need for control and mobility, acknowledging its comparatively lower importation risk. This cross-state coordinated approach distributes inbound flow restrictions temporally and spatially, reducing simultaneous high-risk imports and allowing Texas to adapt dynamically to changing epidemic conditions. Quantitatively, the imported infected individuals scale with inbound flow, fraction allocated, and infection prevalence (imported_infected ~ flow * fraction * (I/S)). By front-loading restrictions for higher-risk origins, the policy reduces cumulative imported infections during critical periods, decreasing secondary transmissions and healthcare burden. Sensitivity to prevalence and transmission rate (beta) underscores the importance of early strict controls—if prevalence or beta increases, the chosen strategies provide a buffer against rapid epidemic amplification. Conversely, if prevalence declines, gradual relaxation preserves economic activity. This risk-adaptive, cooperative framework reflects epidemiological prudence and practical mobility needs, optimizing public health outcomes in Texas over the next 8 weeks."

This cooperative allocation balances importation risk across weeks and states, reducing overall epidemic burden. The quantitative infection-import logic using infected ratios and flow magnitudes guides this balance, ensuring that states contributing higher infection risk face proportionally stricter control timing. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission parameters (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more critical, favoring S1 deployment. Conversely, lower prevalence or beta could allow more uniform or relaxed patterns without increasing risks.

States with moderate to high prevalence and significant flows (Arizona, Mississippi, Virginia) are assigned the S1 pattern, prioritizing strict controls early to reduce immediate risk of importation. New Mexico, with the highest infected prevalence and largest flow, is assigned the S2 relaxed-first-then-strict pattern to mitigate severe mobility disruption initially but tighten controls as risk is realized. This cooperative allocation balances importation risk across weeks and states, reducing overall epidemic burden. The quantitative infection-import logic using infected ratios and flow magnitudes guides this balance, ensuring that states contributing higher infection risk face proportionally stricter control timing. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission parameters (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more critical, favoring S1 deployment. Conversely, lower prevalence or beta could allow more uniform or relaxed patterns without increasing risks. This dynamic policy approach leverages temporal control variation to optimize epidemic suppression while preserving economic and social mobility essential for Texas's sustained resilience."
