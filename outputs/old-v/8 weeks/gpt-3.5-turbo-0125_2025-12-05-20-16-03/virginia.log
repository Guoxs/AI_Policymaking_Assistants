The imported infections can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / Population), meaning higher infected proportion or inflow leads to increased imported risk. Arizona’s infected proportion is roughly 0.000116, which, combined with large flow, warrants a cautious approach. The 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy aligns well here by imposing strict controls initially (low fractions) to curb early importation of infections, then gradually relaxing restrictions as the situation hopefully improves or as Virginia’s own control measures take effect. This approach balances epidemic risk with the economic and social need to maintain mobility over time.

This combination indicates a moderate risk of importation of infections. The imported infected roughly scales with inflow and infected proportion; thus, early strict control helps in limiting initial seeding of new cases in Virginia. The 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy is appropriate to apply stringent restrictions early on, mitigating the risk from exposed and infected travelers, then easing controls as the situation hopefully stabilizes.

Although the inflow to Virginia is comparatively smaller (about 1892 daily), the high infection prevalence poses a substantial risk for imported cases.

The product of inflow and infected proportion yields a considerable risk of infection importation. Given this, a front-loaded strict control strategy to reduce early importation is prudent. The 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy is chosen to minimize early seeding of cases in Virginia from Texas travelers, then ease restrictions as conditions permit. This balances epidemic control with the need to maintain essential economic and social ties with Texas.

  "global_guidance": "In crafting inbound traffic control policies for Virginia, the overarching goal is to minimize imported infections while preserving essential mobility. The chosen strategy across all origin states is 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed,' which imposes stricter controls initially and gradually relaxes them over the eight-week horizon. This approach is epidemiologically sound given the infection prevalences and mobility patterns observed. Arizona, Mississippi, New Mexico, and Texas exhibit varying infection levels and contribute differing volumes of daily inflow to Virginia. New Mexico, with exceptionally high infection prevalence albeit smaller flow, demands the strongest early suppression to prevent seeding Virginia’s epidemic. Texas, despite lower prevalence, contributes a large volume of travelers, necessitating early strict controls as well. Arizona and Mississippi, with moderate prevalence and inflow, benefit similarly from a front-loaded strict approach. Collectively, this strategy reduces early cumulative imported infections and deaths by minimizing the high-risk inflow when epidemic conditions are most precarious. Over time, as local controls take effect and epidemic dynamics evolve, relaxing restrictions balances public health with economic and social needs. The quantitative logic integrates estimated infected travelers as Flow * ft * (I / Population), guiding the selection of stricter control (lower ft) in early weeks to reduce imported infection pressure. Sensitivity considerations include potential changes in infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta). If prevalence rises, the strict-first approach becomes even more critical; if it falls, gradual relaxation remains appropriate. Similarly, changes in transmissibility would amplify or reduce importation risk proportionally, reaffirming the value of adaptive strict control early on.

The chosen strategy across all origin states is 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed,' which imposes stricter controls initially and gradually relaxes them over the eight-week horizon. This approach is epidemiologically sound given the infection prevalences and mobility patterns observed. Arizona, Mississippi, New Mexico, and Texas exhibit varying infection levels and contribute differing volumes of daily inflow to Virginia. New Mexico, with exceptionally high infection prevalence albeit smaller flow, demands the strongest early suppression to prevent seeding Virginia’s epidemic. Texas, despite lower prevalence, contributes a large volume of travelers, necessitating early strict controls as well. Arizona and Mississippi, with moderate prevalence and inflow, benefit similarly from a front-loaded strict approach. Collectively, this strategy reduces early cumulative imported infections and deaths by minimizing the high-risk inflow when epidemic conditions are most precarious. Over time, as local controls take effect and epidemic dynamics evolve, relaxing restrictions balances public health with economic and social needs. The quantitative logic integrates estimated infected travelers as Flow * ft * (I / Population), guiding the selection of stricter control (lower ft) in early weeks to reduce imported infection pressure. Sensitivity considerations include potential changes in infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta). If prevalence rises, the strict-first approach becomes even more critical; if it falls, gradual relaxation remains appropriate. Similarly, changes in transmissibility would amplify or reduce importation risk proportionally, reaffirming the value of adaptive strict control early on. Overall, this coordinated, conservative strategy across all origin states supports Virginia’s epidemic mitigation goals while maintaining vital mobility connections."

    "notes": "Arizona's epidemic risk analysis shows a moderate infected population (I=1368) relative to its total population (~7.12 million susceptible). The exposed (E=4262) and confirmed cases (Q=144618) indicate ongoing transmission but not an extremely high burden compared to other origin states. The importation risk into Virginia depends on the inbound flow (approx. 6778 daily next 56 days) and infection prevalence (I/pop). Calculating roughly, the infected fraction is about 0.00019 (1368/7,117,187), so the expected infected arrivals are proportional to flow * fraction * strategy factor ft. Choosing 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' enforces lower fractions in the initial weeks (0.05 to 0.11) reducing early importation risk when Virginia's internal epidemic is still substantial (I=864). This strict initial control balances limiting imported cases while gradually relaxing controls to allow some mobility later. The strategy effectively mitigates early epidemic seeding from Arizona while acknowledging the medium-level infection pressure and economic ties. This approach carefully balances epidemic control with essential mobility, aiming to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Virginia."

    "notes": "Mississippi presents a moderate infected count (I=636) but a notably higher exposed population (E=11067) relative to its smaller population (~2.83 million susceptible). The confirmed cases Q=16004 and deaths D=3265 suggest moderate ongoing transmission risk. The average inbound flow to Virginia is about 4479 daily, making importation risk significant. The infected fraction (I/pop) is approximately 0.000224, slightly higher than Arizona. Given this, early strict control on inbound mobility is critical to prevent seeding new chains in Virginia. 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' is chosen to impose strong restrictions initially to minimize imported infections when Virginia's local epidemic still poses challenges. Gradual relaxation later helps restore mobility while monitoring trends. This strategy offers an effective epidemic-mobility trade-off by frontloading strict measures during high-risk weeks and easing them as local control improves."

    "notes": "New Mexico exhibits the highest infection risk among origin states with infected I=18414 and exposed E=33517 on a population of ~1.53 million susceptible, indicating a severe outbreak. The infected fraction is ~0.012, which is substantially higher than other states. Average inbound flow is lower (~1666 daily), but the high prevalence means imported infections remain concerning. However, mobility from New Mexico to Virginia is relatively smaller, and imposing very strict early controls could have limited benefit if Virginia’s own epidemic dynamics dominate. Choosing 'S2_relaxed_first_then_strict' allows somewhat relaxed inbound flow initially, supporting essential mobility and economic links, but progressively tightens restrictions in later weeks to prevent sustained importation during vulnerable periods. This U-shaped tightening pattern balances the high risk from New Mexico by intensifying controls as Virginia’s epidemic evolves, while not overly restricting flow early when immediate risk importation may be less critical due to flow magnitude."

The infected fraction (~0.00014) is moderate but the inbound flow to Virginia is very high (~28829 daily), representing a substantial potential for imported infections. Given the large flow, early strict control is essential to mitigate early importation risk and reduce epidemic seeding in Virginia. The 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy imposes strict controls in initial weeks (ft as low as 0.05) when Virginia’s local infection is still significant and relaxes controls progressively to ease mobility pressures later. This strategy effectively balances epidemic control and the economic necessity of mobility, minimizing cumulative imported cases and deaths by focusing efforts on early high-risk weeks."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic control policies for Virginia are designed to minimize imported infections while preserving essential mobility. Arizona, Mississippi, and Texas share moderate infection prevalence but differ in inbound flow volumes. For these states, 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' is selected to impose strict early restrictions, reducing immediate risk of importing infections when Virginia's own epidemic remains substantial. This frontloading of strict control reduces early seeding, preventing exponential growth of cases within Virginia. New Mexico, despite the highest infection prevalence, has relatively lower inbound flow. Its 'S2_relaxed_first_then_strict' strategy allows some initial mobility to maintain economic and social activity, tightening controls later as Virginia's epidemic evolves and risk from sustained importation grows. Collectively, these strategies balance epidemic risk across origin states and weeks, leveraging periods of low transmissibility or improved local control in Virginia to relax controls while preventing early importation spikes. The quantitative cooperation logic involves dynamically allocating stricter controls when local vulnerability is high and relaxing when it is lower. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, earlier and stricter controls become more critical, and vice versa for reductions. These policies are robust to moderate uncertainties in prevalence estimates, as they prioritize initial strict controls to buffer against importation risk. Maintaining adaptability and monitoring is essential to adjust strategies if epidemic conditions or mobility patterns shift significantly."
