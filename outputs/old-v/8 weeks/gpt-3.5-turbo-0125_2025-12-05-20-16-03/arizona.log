The average daily inflow from Mississippi to Arizona is relatively low at 2553.68 individuals. Calculating the infection import risk as inflow * fraction * (I/pop), the risk is non-trivial but not the highest among origin states. Given this, a strategy that starts more strictly and gradually relaxes seems appropriate to minimize early imported infections while allowing some mobility later. The S1_strict_first_then_relaxed strategy reduces disease import risk in the critical first weeks, which is crucial since Mississippi's infectious prevalence is non-negligible though not the highest. This balances epidemic control without unduly restricting mobility over the full 8 weeks."

The inbound flow from Mississippi to Arizona averages 2029.64 daily, a modest volume compared to other states. The estimated importation risk can be approximated by Flow * ft * (I/pop) where low ft reduces imported infections. Given the modest infected prevalence and moderate inflow, a cautious but gradually relaxed approach is warranted. The 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' strategy starts with stringent control (low fractions), reducing early imported risk when Arizona's local infections remain sensitive to new seeding events. Then, as weeks progress, relaxation increases allowing mobility to recover while the risk diminishes due to earlier containment and likely local immunity gains. This balances epidemic risk and economic/activity needs, minimizing early seeding while not overly restricting essential movement. The gradual relaxation also aligns with anticipated improvements in disease control and vaccination. Thus, Mississippi's profile fits well with a front-loaded strict control transitioning to relaxation."

The average daily inflow to Arizona is also very large at 30,902.12 persons, representing a major mobility route. The risk of importing infections is therefore considerable, given by the product of flow, fraction ft, and infection prevalence. To mitigate the high importation risk and protect Arizona from a surge of cases, a strict initial control strategy is justified. The 'S1_strict_first_then_relaxed' pattern reduces inbound flow aggressively in the first weeks when infectious prevalence remains high, lowering imported cases early. This helps prevent amplification of local transmission in Arizona. Over time, as local and external infections are expected to decline due to control measures, the policy gradually relaxes to restore mobility, balancing epidemic control and socio-economic needs. Given New Mexico's high infection burden and large flow, a front-loaded strict control strategy is the optimal choice to minimize imported infections while preserving essential mobility over the medium term."

However, the inbound flow into Arizona is the highest among all states considered, at 44,955.43 daily, representing a significant importation risk due to sheer volume despite low prevalence. The 'S4_mid_strict' strategy, which emphasizes moderate restrictions in the middle weeks, fits this risk profile by avoiding overly strict early restrictions that could disrupt essential mobility from this critical source while still applying mid-term control to curb importations when risk is likely higher. This pattern balances minimizing imported infections with economic and social connectivity, especially given Texas's role as a major travel and commerce hub. The moderate early and late relaxations allow sustained mobility while the mid-term stricter controls reduce risk during periods when transmission dynamics and seasonal factors may elevate risk. Thus, Texas's profile suggests a nuanced approach combining mobility preservation and targeted epidemic control."

The 'S6_U_shape' strategy, which applies relatively higher inbound fractions at the start and end weeks with stricter mid-period control, is suitable here. Early and late relaxation supports essential mobility and economic activity, while the mid-term stricter controls help mitigate any potential surges during periods of higher transmission risk or seasonal effects.

Texas, with huge inbound flow but relatively low prevalence, is assigned a mid-term focused moderate control ('S4_mid_strict') to dampen transmission risk in critical weeks without overly disrupting essential mobility. Virginia, with low prevalence and moderate flow, is managed with a U-shaped temporal pattern ('S6_U_shape'), allowing essential movements early and late with mid-term restrictions to address epidemic fluctuations seasonally or due to behavioral changes. The quantitative importation risk model (imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/pop)) guides these allocations, ensuring weeks with higher expected risk have lower fractions (ft), reducing imported cases. Sensitivity to prevalence and contact rate (beta) is addressed by front-loading strictness for higher risk states and balancing relaxation otherwise, which also supports socio-economic stability.

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic control policies are designed to minimize imported infections and deaths in Arizona by tailoring the stringency of controls according to each origin state's epidemic burden and mobility volume. High-risk states with high prevalence and/or large inbound flow, such as New Mexico, receive strict-first policies to reduce early importation risks when epidemic pressure is greatest. Moderate-risk states like Mississippi also adopt a strict-first strategy but with recognition of their lower prevalence, allowing gradual relaxation. Texas, with high mobility but lower prevalence, benefits from a mid-strict approach that balances early mobility and mid-period control to smooth importation risk over time. Low-risk Virginia employs a uniform strategy, reflecting stable epidemic conditions and modest flow. This differentiated approach leverages quantitative infection-import logic: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/pop), where ft fractions modulate mobility over weeks. By allocating stricter controls when risk is highest and relaxing when risk diminishes, the strategies collectively minimize cumulative imported infections and deaths while preserving essential mobility. Sensitivity analysis reveals that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter or longer-duration controls may be needed, especially for high-flow origins. Conversely, reductions in prevalence or improvements in local containment could permit more relaxed policies.

High-risk states with high prevalence and/or large inbound flow, such as New Mexico, receive strict-first policies to reduce early importation risks when epidemic pressure is greatest. Moderate-risk states like Mississippi also adopt a strict-first strategy but with recognition of their lower prevalence, allowing gradual relaxation. Texas, with high mobility but lower prevalence, benefits from a mid-strict approach that balances early mobility and mid-period control to smooth importation risk over time. Low-risk Virginia employs a uniform strategy, reflecting stable epidemic conditions and modest flow. This differentiated approach leverages quantitative infection-import logic: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/pop), where ft fractions modulate mobility over weeks. By allocating stricter controls when risk is highest and relaxing when risk diminishes, the strategies collectively minimize cumulative imported infections and deaths while preserving essential mobility.

This front-loading of strict control minimizes the initial seeding risk in Arizona, critical given Arizona's current infected population and susceptibility. Quantitatively, the imported infected approximates as Flow * fraction * (I/pop), so lower fractions early on significantly reduce absolute imported infections, particularly from high-flow and/or high-prevalence states like New Mexico and Texas. The gradual relaxation in later weeks balances epidemic control with economic and social mobility imperatives, allowing essential travel as local Arizona conditions stabilize. This cross-state coordination reduces cumulative imported cases and deaths by synchronizing control timing and intensity based on each state's specific epidemic and mobility profiles. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become even more critical to prevent exponential case growth in Arizona. Conversely, if prevalence declines, phased relaxation could accelerate, but given current conditions, conservative early control remains warranted. Overall, this strategy portfolio effectively harmonizes epidemic risk reduction and mobility preservation across states to safeguard Arizona’s public health and economy."
