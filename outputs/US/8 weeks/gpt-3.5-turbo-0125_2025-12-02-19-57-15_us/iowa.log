Sensitivity analysis should be conducted to assess how variations in prevalence or transmission rates may impact the effectiveness of the traffic control policies."

By strategically adjusting the fractions for each neighboring state over the 8-week period, the risk of importing infections into Iowa can be minimized. Cooperation among states is essential to achieve a harmonized approach to epidemic control and mobility. Sensitivity analysis should be conducted to assess how variations in prevalence or transmission rates may impact the effectiveness of the traffic control policies.'
