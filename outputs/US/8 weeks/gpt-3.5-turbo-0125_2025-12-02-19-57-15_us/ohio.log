By imposing a higher fraction of control in the first 4 weeks, we aim to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Ohio. The imported infected cases can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/population), which justifies the need for strict control in the beginning weeks to reduce the risk of transmission. The trade-off between epidemic control and mobility is crucial to prevent overwhelming the healthcare system in Ohio.

By adjusting the inbound traffic allocations over the next 8 weeks, we can minimize the impact of external sources of infection.

Sensitivity analysis should be conducted to understand how changes in prevalence or transmission rates may affect the effectiveness of the traffic control policies.'
