Given the inflow from Alabama to Oklahoma, it is crucial to implement strict traffic control measures to minimize the risk of importing infections.

The recommended policy involves a more relaxed approach in the first 6 weeks to balance the impact on mobility while still controlling the spread.

This strategy aims to minimize the risk of imported infections while considering the balance between epidemic control and essential mobility. By coordinating a phased reduction in inbound traffic across all states, the overall goal is to limit the spread of the disease and reduce the number of imported cases into Oklahoma. Sensitivity analysis should be conducted to assess the impact of variations in prevalence or transmission rates on the effectiveness of these traffic control measures.'
