  "global_guidance": "In order to collectively reduce the expected imported infections and deaths in Idaho, it is essential for all neighboring states to cooperate in implementing traffic control policies. By gradually decreasing inbound traffic over the 8 weeks, the risk of importing infections can be minimized. This requires a delicate balance between epidemic control and mobility, ensuring that essential travel is maintained while reducing the spread of the disease. Sensitivity analyses should be conducted to assess the impact of varying prevalence rates and transmission parameters on the effectiveness of these traffic control measures."

By gradually decreasing inbound traffic over the 8 weeks, the risk of importing infections can be minimized. This requires a delicate balance between epidemic control and mobility, ensuring that essential travel is maintained while reducing the spread of the disease. Sensitivity analyses should be conducted to assess the impact of varying prevalence rates and transmission parameters on the effectiveness of these traffic control measures.'

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce the expected imported infections and deaths, a coordinated effort across neighboring states is essential. By implementing a phased approach to traffic control, focusing on reducing the flow of potentially infected individuals gradually over the 8-week period, the risk of imported infections into Idaho can be minimized. Cooperation among states is crucial to balance the risks and ensure the effectiveness of the traffic control measures. Sensitivity analysis should be conducted to assess how changes in prevalence or transmission rates in each state may impact the overall strategy."

The imported infections are expected to be high due to the significant inflow from Alabama to Idaho.

The inbound traffic from Arizona to Idaho is significant, leading to a higher risk of imported infections.

The fractions are designed to maintain a consistent but controlled flow of traffic, ensuring epidemic control while allowing for essential mobility."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce the expected imported infections and deaths, a coordinated effort among neighboring states is crucial. By implementing traffic control policies that balance epidemic control and mobility, the overall impact on Idaho can be minimized. The fractions assigned to each state take into account the risk levels, population compositions, and inbound traffic, aiming to achieve a harmonized approach in reducing the spread of the disease. Sensitivity to changes in prevalence and transmission rates should be considered when evaluating the effectiveness of the recommended policies."
