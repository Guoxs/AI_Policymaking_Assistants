The control measures start strict in high-risk states and gradually relax over the weeks. By balancing epidemic control with mobility needs, the aim is to reduce the spread of the disease while allowing essential travel. Sensitivity analysis should be conducted to assess the impact of varying prevalence or transmission rates on the effectiveness of these control measures."

    "notes": "In South Carolina, the current population composition shows a small number of individuals in the Exposed (E), Infected (I), and Confirmed (Q) compartments. Given the values of SEIRD parameters, the risk of transmission is moderate, indicating a potential for rapid spread. To minimize the risk of imported infections, it is essential to implement strict traffic control measures. The inbound flow from neighboring states should be reduced gradually over the next 8 weeks to limit the introduction of new cases. The fractions have been distributed to ensure a steady decline in inbound traffic while balancing the need for mobility."
  },
  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocations for South Carolina have been carefully planned to minimize the risk of imported infections. By reducing the flow of individuals from neighboring states with higher average daily population compositions in the Infected (I) and Confirmed (Q) compartments, the overall risk of transmission can be mitigated. The strict traffic control policies in the initial weeks aim to curb the influx of potential cases, while the gradual relaxation in later weeks allows for a balanced approach between epidemic control and maintaining essential mobility. Sensitivity analysis should be conducted to assess how variations in prevalence or transmission parameters may impact the effectiveness of the proposed traffic control measures."
