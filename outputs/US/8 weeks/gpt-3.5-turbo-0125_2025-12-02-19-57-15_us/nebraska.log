    "notes": "In Nebraska, the current population composition shows a relatively low number of infected individuals compared to the susceptible population. However, the presence of exposed individuals raises concerns for potential spread. Considering the SEIRD parameters, the risk of transmission is moderate. The inbound traffic from neighboring states is a significant factor in the spread of the disease. By implementing a stricter traffic control policy in the initial weeks (f1 and f2), we aim to reduce the import of infections. As the infected and exposed population is relatively low in Nebraska, a gradual relaxation of restrictions in the following weeks (f3 to f8) can be implemented to balance epidemic control with mobility. The total of the 8 fractions sums up to 1, ensuring the effectiveness of the traffic control policy."
  },
  "global_guidance": "To minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Nebraska, a collaborative approach with neighboring states is crucial. By strategically adjusting inbound traffic allocations over the next 8 weeks, the risk of imported infections can be reduced collectively. States with higher infection rates should implement stricter policies, while states with lower rates can gradually ease restrictions. This dynamic allocation of traffic control measures ensures a balanced approach to epidemic control and mobility. Sensitivity analysis should be conducted to evaluate the impact of varying prevalence rates and transmission parameters on the effectiveness of the traffic control policies."

      "notes": "The recommended traffic control policy for Nebraska involves a gradual and controlled increase in inbound traffic over the next 8 weeks. This strategy aims to balance the economic and social needs with the public health risks. By starting with a lower fraction in the first three weeks, we aim to minimize the immediate influx of potentially infected individuals. As the weeks progress, the fractions increase to allow for more mobility while still keeping a significant portion of control to prevent a sudden surge in cases. This approach considers the current SEIRD values in Nebraska and the expected imported infections from each neighboring state, adjusting the traffic control policy to mitigate the spread of the disease."
  },
  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocations from neighboring states play a crucial role in controlling the spread of the disease in Nebraska. By collectively reducing the expected imported infections and deaths through strategic traffic control policies, we can effectively manage the epidemic. The quantitative cooperation logic involves balancing the inbound traffic fractions across weeks and states to minimize the overall impact on Nebraska's population. Sensitivity analysis should be conducted to assess how variations in prevalence or beta values could impact the effectiveness of the traffic control policies. By implementing these recommended policies and fostering collaboration among neighboring states, we can work towards containing the spread of the virus and safeguarding the health of the population."
