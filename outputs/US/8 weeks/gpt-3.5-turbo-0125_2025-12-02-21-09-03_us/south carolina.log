By implementing a combination of even, strict-first then relaxed, and relaxed-first then strict traffic control patterns, the overall goal is to minimize the risk of imported infections while allowing for essential mobility. The recommended fractions for each state have been carefully calculated to ensure that the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in South Carolina are minimized while maintaining a balance between epidemic control and mobility.'

Considering the large average daily inflow from Alabama to South Carolina, a strict-first then relaxed traffic control pattern is recommended to initially reduce the imported infections and then gradually ease restrictions.

A relaxed-first then strict traffic control pattern is recommended for Arkansas to start with a more lenient approach and then tighten restrictions as needed.

By implementing a combination of strict-first then relaxed, even, and relaxed-first then strict patterns based on the risk levels and daily inflow from each state, the overall goal is to minimize the impact of external sources on the state's epidemic situation. The cooperation between states in adjusting inbound traffic allocations aims to balance the risk of disease spread across weeks and states, considering the SEIRD parameters and population compositions. Sensitivity analysis should be conducted to assess how variations in prevalence or beta values could affect the effectiveness of these traffic control measures."

Therefore, a consistent traffic control policy with even distribution over the 8 weeks is recommended to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in South Carolina. This even distribution will help maintain a balance between epidemic control and mobility while ensuring that the total inbound flow remains constant. The total of the 8 fractions sum up to 1."

Hence, a traffic control policy starting with relaxed measures and then transitioning to strict controls is recommended. This approach allows for flexibility in mobility initially and ensures tighter restrictions when the risk might increase. By adjusting the fractions in this manner, South Carolina can maintain epidemic control while managing the flow of incoming cases. The total of the 8 fractions sum up to 1."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce expected imported infections and deaths, a strategic approach to traffic control policies is essential. By implementing a combination of even distributions, strict-first-then-relaxed, and relaxed-first-then-strict patterns across different neighboring states, South Carolina can effectively manage the inflow of cases. This coordinated effort will help in balancing the risk of transmission while allowing for essential mobility. Sensitivity to variations in prevalence and beta values is crucial to adapt the traffic control policies effectively."

To prevent a sudden surge in imported infections, a traffic control policy that starts strict and then becomes more relaxed is advised. This strategy aims to initially limit the spread while allowing for gradual normalization of mobility."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies for neighboring states aim to collectively reduce the risk of imported infections into South Carolina. By adopting a mix of even distribution, strict-then-relaxed, and relaxed-then-strict approaches based on each state's risk profile, we can balance epidemic control and mobility. It is crucial to monitor the effectiveness of these policies and adjust them based on evolving trends. Cooperation among states is essential to minimize the overall impact of the pandemic and protect public health."

By adopting a mix of even distribution, strict-then-relaxed, and relaxed-then-strict approaches based on each state's risk profile, we can balance epidemic control and mobility. It is crucial to monitor the effectiveness of these policies and adjust them based on evolving trends. Cooperation among states is essential to minimize the overall impact of the pandemic and protect public health."
