By implementing a mix of strict and relaxed traffic control patterns, the goal is to minimize the importation of infections and reduce the potential impact on Minnesota's population. The even distribution and variations in the control strategies are designed to mitigate risks while allowing for necessary movement. Sensitivity to changes in prevalence and beta values is crucial to adapt control measures effectively."

To minimize the risk of imported infections to Minnesota, a balanced traffic control pattern with even fractions across the 8 weeks is recommended. This approach ensures consistent monitoring and control of inbound traffic, reducing the likelihood of a sudden surge in cases. By distributing the control evenly, Alabama can contribute to the overall containment effort while allowing for some mobility."
