  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce expected imported infections and deaths, it is crucial to implement a mix of traffic control patterns across neighboring states. By coordinating the traffic control measures, the overall risk of imported infections can be minimized. It is important to balance the trade-offs between epidemic control and mobility, taking into account the varying inflow levels from different states. Sensitivity analysis should be conducted to assess how changes in prevalence or transmission parameters impact the effectiveness of the traffic control policies."

      "notes": "In Alabama, the SEIQRD values suggest a moderate risk with a significant number of susceptible individuals. Implementing a traffic control policy that starts with moderate restrictions and gradually eases them can help reduce the risk of importing infections to Iowa. The chosen pattern is strict-first then relaxed to balance epidemic control with mobility. By reducing inbound flow initially, we can minimize the impact of potential imported cases on Iowa's population. The trade-off here lies in limiting interstate mobility to protect public health. The fractions sum to 1, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant over 8 weeks."

      "notes": "In Arizona, the SEIQRD values indicate a moderate risk level with notable infected and confirmed cases. To mitigate the risk of importing infections to Iowa, a traffic control policy that starts with relatively strict measures and then gradually relaxes them is recommended. The chosen pattern is relaxed-first then strict to adapt to the current risk trends and projected infection pressure. By allowing more inbound flow in later weeks, the policy balances epidemic control with necessary interstate mobility. The fractions sum to 1, ensuring a consistent total inbound flow over the 8-week period."

  "global_guidance": "Implementing traffic control policies across neighboring states is crucial to collectively reduce the expected imported infections and deaths in Iowa. By coordinating inbound allocations, the overall risk of spreading the disease can be minimized. The quantitative cooperation logic involves balancing inbound traffic to ensure that each state contributes to reducing the risk while allowing essential mobility. Sensitivity reasoning is essential to understand how variations in prevalence or transmission rates can impact the effectiveness of these traffic control policies."

By evenly distributing the inbound traffic over the 8 weeks, we aim to minimize the impact on Iowa's epidemic control while maintaining some level of mobility. This pattern allows for a steady flow of traffic while reducing the risk of a sudden surge in imported infections.
