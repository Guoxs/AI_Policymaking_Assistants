This pattern allows for a controlled and steady flow of inbound traffic, which can help minimize the risk of imported infections into New Mexico. By starting with a lower fraction in the first week and increasing it gradually, we can better manage the potential influx of infected individuals and reduce the strain on New Mexico's healthcare system.

    "notes": "In Arkansas, I suggest a traffic control policy that starts strict in the first four weeks and then gradually relaxes over the remaining four weeks. This strategy aims to initially minimize the risk of imported infections by imposing stricter controls and then gradually easing restrictions as the situation stabilizes. By front-loading the stricter measures, we can proactively address any potential spikes in imported cases while allowing for more flexibility in later weeks."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies for neighboring states aim to strike a balance between epidemic control and mobility. By implementing varying patterns of traffic control based on the risk trends and projected infection pressure in each state, we can collectively reduce the expected imported infections and deaths in New Mexico. Coordinated efforts to minimize inbound traffic over the next 8 weeks can help mitigate the spread of the disease while allowing essential travel to continue. It is crucial to monitor the effectiveness of these policies and adjust them as needed based on evolving epidemiological data and risk assessments."

By implementing a mix of uniform control, strict-then-relaxed, and relaxed-then-strict policies based on the risk levels of each state, we aim to minimize the cumulative impact of imported infections on New Mexico. It is crucial to maintain a coordinated approach across states to achieve a harmonized reduction in the transmission of the disease. Sensitivity analysis should be conducted to assess the impact of varying prevalence rates or transmission parameters on the effectiveness of these traffic control policies."

By implementing a mix of uniform control, strict-then-relaxed, and relaxed-then-strict policies based on the risk levels of each state, we aim to minimize the cumulative impact of imported infections on New Mexico. It is crucial to maintain a coordinated approach across states to achieve a harmonized reduction in the transmission of the disease. Sensitivity analysis should be conducted to assess the impact of varying prevalence rates or transmission parameters on the effectiveness of these traffic control policies.'

By implementing a combination of uniform, strict-first then relaxed, and relaxed-first then strict traffic control patterns, the inbound traffic flow can be managed effectively over the 8 weeks. This approach allows for a coordinated effort to minimize the spread of the disease while considering the need for mobility and economic activities. Sensitivity analysis should be conducted to assess the impact of varying prevalence or transmission rates on the effectiveness of these traffic control policies."

By implementing a combination of uniform, strict-first then relaxed, and relaxed-first then strict traffic control patterns, the inbound traffic flow can be managed effectively over the 8 weeks. This approach allows for a coordinated effort to minimize the spread of the disease while considering the need for mobility and economic activities. Sensitivity analysis should be conducted to assess the impact of varying prevalence or transmission rates on the effectiveness of these traffic control policies.'
