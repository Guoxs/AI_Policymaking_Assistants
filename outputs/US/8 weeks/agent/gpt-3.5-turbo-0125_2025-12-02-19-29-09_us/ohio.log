By gradually decreasing inbound traffic over the 8-week period while balancing the fractions based on each state's risk profile, a coordinated effort can be made to minimize the impact of external infections. Sensitivity analysis should be conducted to understand how variations in prevalence or transmission rates could affect the effectiveness of these traffic control measures."
