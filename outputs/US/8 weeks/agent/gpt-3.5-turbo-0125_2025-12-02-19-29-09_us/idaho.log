Sensitivity reasoning includes scenarios where prevalence or beta values change, highlighting the need for adaptive strategies to manage the evolving situation."

By strategically adjusting the inbound traffic allocations over the 8-week period, the overall risk of disease spread can be minimized. The quantitative cooperation logic involves balancing the traffic control measures across states and weeks to ensure a coordinated effort in reducing the importation of infections. Sensitivity reasoning includes scenarios where prevalence or beta values change, highlighting the need for adaptive strategies to manage the evolving situation.'
