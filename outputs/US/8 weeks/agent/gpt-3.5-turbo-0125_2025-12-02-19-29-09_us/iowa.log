  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce imported infections and deaths in Iowa, the inbound traffic allocations from neighboring states should be strategically planned. By controlling the flow of individuals from each state based on their infection rates and the risk of importation, we can effectively mitigate the spread of the disease. There needs to be a balance between strict traffic control to prevent a surge in cases and allowing some mobility for economic and social reasons. Sensitivity to changes in infection rates and mobility patterns is crucial for adjusting the traffic control policies effectively."

By controlling the flow of individuals from each state based on their infection rates and the risk of importation, we can effectively mitigate the spread of the disease. There needs to be a balance between strict traffic control to prevent a surge in cases and allowing some mobility for economic and social reasons. Sensitivity to changes in infection rates and mobility patterns is crucial for adjusting the traffic control policies effectively.'

To minimize imported infections to Iowa, the inbound traffic should be stricter in the first few weeks to reduce the risk of introducing more cases.

To minimize the risk of importing cases into Iowa, stricter inbound traffic control is recommended in the initial weeks.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies for each neighboring state of Iowa are designed to minimize the imported infections and deaths in Iowa by balancing epidemic control with mobility. The fractions allocated for inbound traffic over the 8-week period have been carefully adjusted to ensure consistency and effectiveness. By implementing these measures collectively across the neighboring states, the overall risk of transmission to Iowa can be significantly reduced. Sensitivity analysis should be conducted to evaluate the impact of variations in prevalence rates and transmission parameters on the effectiveness of these traffic control policies."
