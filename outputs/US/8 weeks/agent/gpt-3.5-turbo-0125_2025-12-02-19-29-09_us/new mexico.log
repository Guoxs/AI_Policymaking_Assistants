By gradually adjusting inbound traffic fractions over the 8-week period, we aim to reduce the risk of transmission and prevent a surge in confirmed and deceased cases in New Mexico. The strategy focuses on a controlled approach that prioritizes epidemic control while allowing for necessary interstate travel. Sensitivity analysis shows that variations in prevalence or transmission rates could impact the effectiveness of these policies, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring and adaptation."

By gradually adjusting inbound traffic fractions over the 8-week period, we aim to reduce the risk of transmission and prevent a surge in confirmed and deceased cases in New Mexico. The strategy focuses on a controlled approach that prioritizes epidemic control while allowing for necessary interstate travel. Sensitivity analysis shows that variations in prevalence or transmission rates could impact the effectiveness of these policies, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring and adaptation.'
