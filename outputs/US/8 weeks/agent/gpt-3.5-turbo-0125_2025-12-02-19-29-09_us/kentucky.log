By adjusting inbound traffic fractions, the goal is to balance epidemic control with essential mobility needs. The overall strategy is to gradually relax control measures while ensuring the total inbound flow remains constant. Cooperation among states is crucial to collectively reduce the risk of imported infections and deaths. Sensitivity analysis should be conducted to assess the impact of varying prevalence or transmission rates on the effectiveness of these traffic control policies.'

By strategically adjusting inbound traffic allocations over the next 8 weeks, we can minimize the risk of disease spread while considering the trade-offs between epidemic control and mobility.
