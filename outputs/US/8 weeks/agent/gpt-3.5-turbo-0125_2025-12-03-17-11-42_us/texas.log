The risk of imported infections is proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), and with a daily inflow of 74,923, a strict initial control reduces early imported infections. The traffic pattern is strict-first, prioritizing stricter control in early weeks (lowest fractions in weeks 4-6) to minimize seeding infections when local susceptibility is high. Later weeks have gradually relaxed control as local Texas immunity increases. This trade-off balances epidemic control and mobility by reducing early introductions while allowing some movement later.

States with higher infection prevalence (I and E) relative to their population and significant inflow volumes, such as Arkansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Tennessee, are subject to stricter early controls (strict-first pattern) to reduce the probability of importation events seeding local transmission. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or lower inflow volumes can afford more relaxed or even relaxed-first patterns to maintain essential mobility while still managing risk. The fractions for each origin state's weekly inbound flows are carefully balanced to sum to exactly 1, preserving the total volume of travel but redistributing it to minimize infection seeding during high-risk periods. This cross-state cooperation logic leverages temporal shifts in inbound traffic to flatten the importation risk curve, preventing early spikes that could overwhelm Texas' health system. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increase, further tightening early controls or extending strict control duration would be warranted. Conversely, if local immunity increases or beta decreases, the policy could be relaxed earlier to restore mobility. By integrating infection prevalence, flow volume, and epidemic parameters, the policy achieves a nuanced balance of epidemic control and economic activity, reducing overall epidemic burden in Texas."

The imported infected estimate roughly follows imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/Population), suggesting lower weekly fractions reduce risk. Given a stable or slightly decreasing infection trend, a strict-first pattern is chosen to front-load control, minimizing early seeding of Texas infections. This pattern allows initial waves to be suppressed and gradual relaxation as epidemiological pressures ease. The trade-off balances mobility needs with epidemic control; stricter early control may strain travel but helps reduce cumulative cases and deaths. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000, validating the allocation."

The formula imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/Population) implies significant sensitivity to flow fractions. Observing a slight decrease in infection prevalence, strict control is prioritized early (strict-first pattern) to prevent early importation peaks into Texas. This front-loading of restrictions reduces pressure on Texas's health system. The trade-off involves restricting travel initially, which may impact economic and personal mobility, but the benefit is a lowered epidemic burden. The fractions total exactly 1, meeting constraints."

The imported infection risk formula suggests modulating fractions to avoid early spikes. A relaxed-first pattern is chosen here, reflecting possible decreasing infection trends allowing some early mobility easing, while overall balancing risk by tightening slightly later.

Conversely, states with moderate or improving epidemiological situations (e.g., Arkansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma) employ relaxed-first or even patterns to balance mobility needs with epidemic control. This cross-state coordination leverages the fact that imported infections roughly scale with Flow*ft*(I/Population); thus, reducing early flow fractions from higher-risk states significantly lowers early infection pressure in Texas, which is crucial for preventing exponential growth. The weekly variation in fractions represents a temporal risk balancing act, allowing gradual relaxation as local Texas conditions improve or as imported infection risks decrease. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls would yield greater benefits, while lower rates might permit more relaxed patterns. Conversely, if mobility demands are high, even patterns prevent sharp economic disruptions but may increase cumulative cases. Overall, the policy achieves a calibrated trade-off, distributing traffic control efforts where and when they are most epidemiologically impactful, validated by precise fraction sums equal to 1 for each state, ensuring full flow allocation without artificial inflation or reduction."

The risk of importing infections is proportional to Flow * ft * (I / total population), where total population is roughly the sum of all compartments. Alabama's large average past inflow (32789.14) to Texas means it is a significant source of imported cases. Given moderate infection levels and steady inflow, a slight early reduction in traffic (strict-first pattern) helps reduce immediate risk while allowing some relaxation in later weeks as infection pressure is expected to stabilize or decline. The trade-off balances epidemic control by reducing early peak importation of cases and maintaining mobility over the entire period. The fractions sum to 1 exactly, validating the allocation."

Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller flows have more even or slightly relaxed early policies, balancing economic mobility with risk. The sum of fractions for each state is precisely 1, ensuring the total inbound flow remains constant over 8 weeks, preserving overall mobility volume but redistributing it to minimize peak epidemic pressure. This inter-temporal allocation exploits the epidemic dynamics where early reduction in imported infections can significantly curb local transmission chains, given the SEIQRD parameters of Texas. The cooperation logic is to stagger and reduce imported infection peaks from multiple states, thus preventing simultaneous multiple infection surges in Texas. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if the transmission rate (beta) or prevalence in origin states changes, the strictness of early weeks might need adjustment; higher prevalence or beta would warrant stricter early controls to prevent overwhelming Texas' outbreak. The strategy thus dynamically balances reducing expected cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Texas while minimizing disruption to overall mobility flow, achieving an optimal trade-off for epidemic management."

With a substantial daily inbound flow of 38249, the risk of importing infections into Texas is significant. The expected imported infections approximate Flow*ft*(I/S), indicating that controlling early weeks strictly reduces initial imported cases, lowering secondary spread risk. Hence, a strict-first pattern is chosen, with lower fractions in the initial weeks to reduce early pressure. The strategy balances epidemic control and mobility by gradually relaxing controls in later weeks to maintain economic activity. The weekly fractions sum to exactly 1, confirming consistent allocation."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations for Texas prioritize reducing early-week imported infections from states with high infection prevalence (e.g., Arkansas, Idaho, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah) by adopting strict-first patterns with lower fractions in the initial weeks. This approach minimizes initial seeding events in Texas, reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. States with lower infection pressure or more stable epidemic curves (e.g., Minnesota, Virginia, Kentucky) follow more even or mildly strict-first patterns to balance epidemic control and mobility. The total inbound daily average flow per state remains constant over 8 weeks, with weekly fractions summing exactly to 1 to preserve traffic volume integrity. Quantitatively, imported infections are approximated by Flow*ft*(I/S), so reducing ft in weeks where I/S is high or where early intervention offers maximal benefits minimizes overall infection inflow. Cross-state coordination balances early strict controls in high-risk origins with gradual relaxation, collectively reducing Texas's epidemic burden while sustaining critical economic activity. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence (I/S) or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early-week controls become more critical, whereas lower prevalence allows more uniform traffic distributions. These policies are robust to moderate parameter fluctuations due to their emphasis on early containment and balanced mobility."

This approach minimizes initial seeding events in Texas, reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. States with lower infection pressure or more stable epidemic curves (e.g., Minnesota, Virginia, Kentucky) follow more even or mildly strict-first patterns to balance epidemic control and mobility. The total inbound daily average flow per state remains constant over 8 weeks, with weekly fractions summing exactly to 1 to preserve traffic volume integrity. Quantitatively, imported infections are approximated by Flow*ft*(I/S), so reducing ft in weeks where I/S is high or where early intervention offers maximal benefits minimizes overall infection inflow. Cross-state coordination balances early strict controls in high-risk origins with gradual relaxation, collectively reducing Texas's epidemic burden while sustaining critical economic activity. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence (I/S) or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early-week controls become more critical, whereas lower prevalence allows more uniform traffic distributions. These policies are robust to moderate parameter fluctuations due to their emphasis on early containment and balanced mobility."
