The expected imported infections roughly scale with Flow * fraction * (I / population), so controlling early weeks strictly (lower fractions) helps reduce initial importation when Wisconsin's outbreak could worsen. We adopt a strict-first pattern, applying lower fractions in the first four weeks to suppress early imported cases, then gradually relax controls. This balances epidemic control and mobility, spreading the flow to later weeks when Wisconsin might better manage cases. Fractions sum to 1.000 exactly, validating allocation."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policy distributes the total inbound flow from each origin state over the next 8 weeks to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Wisconsin. This is achieved by applying stricter controls (lower fractions) during the early weeks for states with higher infection prevalence (I/population), thereby suppressing early imported infections that could exacerbate Wisconsin's outbreak. For states with lower infection prevalence, an even or mild strict-first pattern is used to balance epidemic control and economic mobility. The logic follows the approximate formula: expected imported infected cases ~ Flow * fraction * (I / population), motivating lower fractions during peak risk periods. The traffic allocation patterns collectively reduce the initial seeding of infections in Wisconsin, flattening the epidemic curve and lowering deaths. The staggered relaxation of controls across weeks allows for gradual restoration of mobility and economic activity without abrupt increases in infection risk. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) increases, stricter or longer early controls may be warranted to prevent surges. Conversely, if prevalence falls or vaccination improves, controls can be relaxed sooner. This cross-state cooperative strategy balances public health objectives with socioeconomic needs, ensuring the sum of fractions per state equals exactly one to maintain total inbound flow constant while optimizing timing to mitigate epidemic spread."

The expected imported infections can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population), so reducing flow early when infected is low but present helps curb initial seeds of transmission in Wisconsin. The traffic allocation follows a strict-first pattern, frontloading stricter controls (lower fractions) in the first weeks to limit early importation of exposed and infected individuals. This approach balances epidemic control with mobility by gradually relaxing controls as incoming infection pressure diminishes or is managed locally. The fractions sum to exactly 1.0000, validating the allocation."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocations across all origin states collectively aim to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Wisconsin by strategically managing the timing and intensity of travel flows based on infection prevalence and mobility volume. States with higher infected and exposed populations—such as Michigan, Minnesota, Indiana, and Ohio—are assigned strict-first traffic control patterns that frontload stricter restrictions in the early weeks to prevent early seeding of infections in Wisconsin. This is critical because early importation can spark local outbreaks that amplify transmission. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller flow volumes receive more even or slightly relaxed-first patterns that balance epidemic control and economic mobility. The approach leverages quantitative cooperation logic: the total inbound flow per origin state over 8 weeks remains constant to respect baseline mobility, but weekly fractions are shifted to spread risk more effectively. By reducing flow when infection prevalence is highest and allowing gradual relaxation as infection pressure lowers, the policy mitigates peak epidemic pressure and distributes economic impact over time. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls should be emphasized further, potentially extending strict periods. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccination/immunity improves, relaxing controls earlier may be feasible with little impact on health outcomes. Overall, this multi-state coordinated control strategy optimizes epidemic containment while preserving necessary mobility, supported by exact fraction sums ensuring policy feasibility and consistent baseline flows."

The key principle guiding these allocations is to minimize importation of infectious individuals when epidemic pressure is highest, especially early in the planning horizon, thereby reducing seeding of new infections in Wisconsin. States with higher prevalence of infectious (I) and exposed (E) individuals relative to their populations receive stricter early-week controls (low fractions), reflecting the higher risk of importing infected travelers. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure or higher population but low prevalence have more relaxed early controls to balance epidemic control with economic and mobility considerations. This results in patterns such as strict-first, where early weeks have lower fractions, or relaxed-first, where early weeks have higher fractions but controls tighten later to prevent later surges. The quantitative cooperation logic involves estimating expected imported infections as proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population) for each origin state and week; by lowering ft in early weeks for high-risk states, cumulative importation is reduced. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become even more crucial, whereas if prevalence decreases, allocations may be relaxed. The even patterns for states with low prevalence ensure stable mobility without significant epidemic risk. All fractions for each state sum exactly to 1, preserving the total inbound flow. This coordinated cross-state approach balances the trade-off between epidemic risk mitigation and mobility needs, aiming to minimize Wisconsin's epidemic burden over the next 8 weeks while maintaining socio-economic activity."
