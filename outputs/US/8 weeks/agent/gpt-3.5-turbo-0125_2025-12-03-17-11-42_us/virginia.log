The imported infected cases scale approximately with Flow*ft*(I/population), indicating that reducing traffic in weeks with higher infection prevalence reduces imported infections. Alabama's infection levels show some persistence, so a strict-first pattern is chosen to frontload control measures in the first four weeks, reducing inflow fractions to 15% each week, then relaxing later to 10% fractions. This trade-off aims to minimize early seeding of infections in Virginia while allowing some mobility later. The fractions sum to exactly 1.0000, ensuring flow consistency."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic control policies for Virginia are designed to collectively minimize imported infections and deaths by strategically allocating traffic restrictions across origin states and weeks. States with higher infection prevalence (I and E) and higher infection pressure, such as South Carolina, Arkansas, Idaho, Tennessee, and Michigan, receive stricter front-loaded controls to reduce early seeding risk in Virginia. This strict-first pattern prioritizes limiting incoming infected individuals when epidemic risk is highest, thereby slowing disease spread in Virginia. States with moderate or lower infection levels, such as Iowa, Minnesota, Kentucky, and Wisconsin, have relatively balanced or mildly strict-first fraction patterns, reflecting lower infection pressure and balancing mobility needs. The fractions for each origin state sum exactly to 1.0000, preserving total inbound flow over the 8-week horizon. Quantitatively, imported infected cases scale with the product of inbound flow, traffic fraction, and infection prevalence (I/population) in the origin state. By reducing ft in early weeks for high-risk states, the expected number of imported infections in Virginia is minimized during critical periods. This cross-state cooperation balances epidemic risk across weeks and origins, avoiding spikes in imported infections while allowing gradual relaxation of controls to support economic activity. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission parameters (beta) increase, stricter early controls would yield greater benefits, while lower prevalence may permit more relaxed policies. Overall, the traffic control policy employs a data-driven approach leveraging origin state infection status and mobility baselines to optimally allocate inbound traffic restrictions, minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia."

The imported infections can be approximated as imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), where I/population is about 434/5,000,000 = 8.68e-5. Given the steady inflow of 11,079 daily, the risk is non-negligible but not extremely high. A strict-first pattern is chosen, applying stricter controls in the initial weeks (fractions 0.10 each for weeks 1-6) to reduce early importation of infected individuals. The last two weeks have relaxed controls (0.20 each) to balance mobility needs and economic activity. This pattern leverages the incubation and infectious period to minimize cumulative cases.

  "global_guidance": "The traffic allocation strategy across all origin states collectively aims to minimize imported infections and subsequent deaths in Virginia by applying stricter traffic controls in the early weeks, especially for states with higher infection prevalence and inflow volumes. By front-loading restrictions (strict-first pattern) where infection pressure is higher, we reduce the seeding of new cases early in the 8-week horizon, which is crucial given the incubation period and the transmission dynamics characterized by beta=0.03328 and delta=1.92. The total flow volume remains constant for each origin state by ensuring the fractions sum to exactly 1, preserving mobility but redistributing it temporally to reduce peak infection importation. This temporal balancing allows some relaxation in later weeks when the risk of newly imported infections diminishes due to prior control efforts and potentially higher population immunity or reduced prevalence in origin states. Quantitatively, the expected imported infected individuals each week are proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing ft in weeks of higher I/population or higher flows effectively lowers imported infections. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, the benefits of early strict controls become more pronounced, necessitating even lower early fractions. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more even or relaxed traffic schedules could be considered to support economic activity. This nuanced, state-specific and time-phased approach balances epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs, optimizing overall health outcomes in Virginia."

The risk of importing infections is proportional to the inbound flow multiplied by the infected fraction (I/total population). Given the substantial average daily inflow (8680.46) and moderate infections, a strict-first pattern is chosen. This means stricter controls (lower fractions) in the early weeks to prevent initial seeding of the virus in Virginia, gradually relaxing as the epidemic pressure is expected to decline or local controls improve. This approach balances early epidemic control with preserving mobility over time. The fractions sum to exactly 1, ensuring the total inbound flow remains constant."

The baseline flow (6342.46) is substantial, so early weeks have stricter control to mitigate importation risk.

This approach means lower traffic fractions in the initial weeks when the risk of seeding new outbreaks is highest due to relatively high infected and exposed populations in many states. Over time, the traffic controls relax to restore mobility and economic activities, assuming that local epidemic control measures or natural epidemic dynamics reduce infection prevalence. Quantitatively, the imported infections are roughly proportional to the product of inbound flow, traffic fraction, and infected fraction in the origin state (imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population)). By minimizing early imported infected cases through low fractions in early weeks, the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia are expected to decrease significantly. Cross-state coordination is implicitly achieved by applying this pattern uniformly adjusted by infection intensity and inflow magnitude, balancing risk across states and weeks. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls would be necessary, while lower prevalence or effective local interventions could allow more relaxed policies. Maintaining the sum of fractions to exactly 1 for each origin state ensures total mobility is conserved over 8 weeks, only shifted temporally to optimize epidemic outcomes."

Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls would be necessary, while lower prevalence or effective local interventions could allow more relaxed policies. Maintaining the sum of fractions to exactly 1 for each origin state ensures total mobility is conserved over 8 weeks, only shifted temporally to optimize epidemic outcomes.'

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations strategically prioritize stricter controls in the early weeks for origin states with higher infection and exposure prevalence, such as Idaho, Utah, Tennessee, and Arkansas, to reduce the immediate importation of infectious individuals into Virginia. This approach leverages the understanding that imported infections scale with the product of the inbound flow, infection prevalence, and control fraction per week. By front-loading restrictions where infection pressure is highest, the policy minimizes cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia over the 8-week horizon. For states with lower or moderate infection levels, more even or gradually relaxed traffic patterns are chosen to balance epidemic control with socio-economic mobility, avoiding unnecessary disruptions. Collectively, these allocations maintain the total inbound flow per origin state, preserving overall travel volume but redistributing it temporally to flatten importation peaks. The strategy reflects cooperative risk balancing across states and weeks, recognizing that controlling importation risk early reduces downstream transmission and deaths. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become more critical, whereas if infection prevalence declines, more relaxed patterns are viable. The approach thus adapts to infection pressure while ensuring total mobility remains stable, optimizing Virginia's epidemic outcomes."
