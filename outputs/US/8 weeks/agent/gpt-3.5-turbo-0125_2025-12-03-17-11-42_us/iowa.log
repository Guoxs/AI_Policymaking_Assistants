This strict-first pattern frontloads restrictions to reduce early imported infections, which is critical given the exponential growth potential of the epidemic. For states with lower prevalence or larger population bases diluting infection ratios (e.g., Texas, Virginia, Kentucky), a relaxed-first pattern is adopted to balance economic mobility and epidemic control.

This approach quantitatively balances the imported infected risk approximated by Flow * ft * (I/population) across states and weeks. The model is sensitive to infection prevalence and transmission rate beta; higher beta or increasing prevalence would necessitate stricter early controls and possibly longer durations of restriction. Conversely, lower prevalence or effective local control in Iowa reduces the need for stringent inbound restrictions. By coordinating traffic policies across states, the cumulative imported infections and subsequent cases and deaths in Iowa are minimized, while preserving essential mobility and economic activity over the 8-week horizon."

The imported infected can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/population), where Flow is inbound flow and ft is the weekly fraction. Given that Alabama's flow to Iowa is modest (2223.93 daily), the risk of imported infection is moderate. To minimize risk, a strict-first pattern is chosen, imposing stricter controls in the initial weeks (lower fractions) to reduce early importation of infections, then gradually relaxing controls later to balance mobility. This pattern also helps prevent seeding new outbreaks early. The sum of fractions is exactly 1.000, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic control policies collectively aim to minimize imported infections and deaths in Iowa by adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions from each origin state while maintaining total 8-week flow constant. States with higher infection prevalence (I/population) and/or higher inbound flows receive stricter early traffic restrictions (strict-first pattern) to reduce early importation of infections, which is critical to prevent seeding new outbreaks in Iowa. For states with relatively low infection pressure or steady prevalence, even traffic control patterns are used to balance mobility and epidemic control without causing undue disruption. The traffic control strategy uses the approximation of imported infections as proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), focusing on reducing ft in peak infection risk periods. By staggering restrictions, the policy avoids simultaneous severe mobility reductions across all states, allowing gradual normalization and economic activity. This cooperation across states balances epidemic control and mobility. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increase, stricter and longer initial controls become necessary to mitigate importation risk. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or immunity rises, controls can be relaxed earlier. The approach is robust to fluctuations in prevalence and contact rates due to its adaptive weekly fractions per state, allowing targeted interventions. Overall, this coordinated, data-driven traffic control policy optimizes epidemic suppression in Iowa while preserving essential travel and economic functions."

The expected imported infections in week t is roughly Flow * ft * (I / total population), so controlling the fraction ft in early weeks reduces imported infections into Iowa. Given the moderate infection levels, a strict-first pattern is chosen, imposing greater restrictions early (f1=0.05, f2=0.05) and gradually relaxing traffic to allow mobility later when disease pressure may lessen. This balances epidemic control by minimizing early imported cases that could trigger local outbreaks while preserving mobility in later weeks.

The imported infection risk is roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population). Given the moderate infection pressure, a strict-first pattern is chosen, imposing stricter control initially (low fractions in weeks 1-2) to reduce early imported cases to Iowa, then gradually relaxing control (higher fractions in weeks 3-4) as the situation stabilizes. This balances epidemic control with mobility needs, allowing some travel later while minimizing initial risk. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000, ensuring consistent total flow."

    "notes": "Wisconsin's infected count (I=8297) and high inflow to Iowa imply moderate to high importation risk. Imported infections scale as Flow*ft*(I/population). A strict-first pattern minimizes early importation, relaxing control progressively to balance epidemic control and mobility. Fractions sum exactly to 1."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocations across all origin states prioritize minimizing early imported infections to Iowa by enforcing stricter controls in initial weeks (strict-first pattern). This approach exploits the infection prevalence dynamics (I/population) and flows, focusing on weeks when epidemic pressure is highest in origin states. By reducing early traffic fractions in weeks 1-3, we lower the seeding risk of new infections in Iowa, which is crucial given Iowa's current epidemic state with moderate exposed and infected populations. The gradual relaxation of control in later weeks balances the socio-economic need for mobility with epidemic control, allowing travel restoration when infection risks are comparatively lower or better managed. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections are roughly proportional to the product of Flow, fraction ft, and infection prevalence in origin states. Therefore, lowering ft early in states with high I/population reduces total imported cases significantly. The allocations ensure total inbound flow per origin state is preserved (fractions sum to 1), maintaining fairness and predictability in travel volume. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence increases or transmission rate beta rises, stricter early controls would be even more critical; conversely, if prevalence or beta decreases, controls could be relaxed sooner. This coordinated multi-state timing strategy is optimal to reduce cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Iowa by minimizing initial epidemic seeding, allowing Iowa's own control measures to manage internal spread effectively."
