  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocations aim to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Indiana by strategically adjusting weekly fractions to reduce imported infections during periods of higher infection prevalence in origin states. The importation risk is approximated as daily inbound flow multiplied by the fraction of infected individuals in the origin state's population and the weekly fraction. States with higher infection pressure (higher I and E relative to population) and/or high inbound flows are assigned stricter controls (lower weekly fractions) early in the 8-week period, adopting a strict-first or relaxed-first pattern depending on the temporal trends and economic considerations. This phased control approach reduces early imported cases when Indiana's local health system is vulnerable, while gradually relaxing restrictions to balance economic and mobility needs. Lower prevalence states or those with low inbound flows receive more even or relaxed-first patterns to sustain essential travel and trade. Quantitatively, this distribution maintains the total inbound flow constant by ensuring fractions sum to exactly one per state, redistributing flow to weeks with lower infection pressure. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence rises unexpectedly or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter control fractions would need earlier intensification and possibly extended duration, emphasizing the importance of flexible and adaptive traffic policies. Conversely, if prevalence drops, some relaxation could be accelerated. This cooperative multi-state strategy balances epidemic control across states, mitigating cross-border transmission risks while preserving regional mobility."

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy balances epidemic control and mobility across all origin states to Indiana by modulating weekly traffic fractions while keeping total 8-week inflow constant. States with higher infection prevalence (e.g., Michigan, Ohio) and/or large inflows receive stricter early controls (low early fractions) to reduce initial importation of infected individuals, minimizing new confirmed and deceased cases in Indiana. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or smaller inflows have more relaxed or even traffic patterns to support economic activity. The relaxed-first pattern predominates, with gradual easing of restrictions over weeks to balance mobility and epidemic risk. This is justified by expected declining infection pressure and the need to avoid prolonged economic disruption. The quantitative importation risk is approximated as Flow*ft*(I/S), guiding the allocation. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become more critical, while if prevalence or beta decrease, more relaxed patterns are feasible. Coordinated cross-state control optimizes epidemic outcomes in Indiana by distributing risk temporally and spatially. All fraction vectors sum exactly to 1, preserving total inbound flow, ensuring policy feasibility and compliance with constraints."

In contrast, some high-inflow but lower-prevalence states adopt relaxed-first patterns to sustain economic activity early, tightening later to manage cumulative risk. Even patterns are applied where infection risk and inflow are moderate to balance epidemic control and mobility smoothly. The quantitative logic follows approximate imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/population), so reducing ft in weeks with higher infection pressure effectively reduces infections imported into Indiana. Traffic is shifted from higher-risk weeks to lower-risk weeks, distributing risk temporally and spatially. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early reductions become more critical, while lower prevalence allows more mobility. Balancing mobility and epidemic control is essential; overly strict controls may harm economic activity, while lax controls risk outbreaks. The 8 fractions for each state sum exactly to 1.0000, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant and respecting constraints. This coordinated inter-state strategy optimizes Indiana's epidemic outcome by limiting imported infections from multiple origins over time."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce expected imported infections and deaths in Indiana, inbound traffic control policies prioritize early reduction of flows from origin states with high infection prevalence and high inbound flows, such as Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Texas. These states contribute more to imported infection risk due to their high infected counts relative to population and large mobility into Indiana. The strict-first pattern applied to these states frontloads stricter control in initial weeks to suppress early seeding of infections. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller flows receive either even or mild strict-first patterns to balance epidemic control with mobility needs. The total inbound flow over 8 weeks remains constant per origin state, redistributing flow fractions weekly to minimize cumulative cases and deaths. This cooperative approach reduces the overall infection pressure by smoothing and delaying importation, allowing Indiana's health system to respond effectively. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become more critical, while if prevalence decreases, more relaxed policies may be feasible. The approach ensures total inbound flow per state is preserved but redistributes it temporally to maximize epidemic control benefits. This cross-state coordination is essential given interconnected risks and mobility patterns."

These states contribute more to imported infection risk due to their high infected counts relative to population and large mobility into Indiana. The strict-first pattern applied to these states frontloads stricter control in initial weeks to suppress early seeding of infections. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller flows receive either even or mild strict-first patterns to balance epidemic control with mobility needs. The total inbound flow over 8 weeks remains constant per origin state, redistributing flow fractions weekly to minimize cumulative cases and deaths. This cooperative approach reduces the overall infection pressure by smoothing and delaying importation, allowing Indiana's health system to respond effectively. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become more critical, while if prevalence decreases, more relaxed policies may be feasible. The approach ensures total inbound flow per state is preserved but redistributes it temporally to maximize epidemic control benefits. This cross-state coordination is essential given interconnected risks and mobility patterns."
