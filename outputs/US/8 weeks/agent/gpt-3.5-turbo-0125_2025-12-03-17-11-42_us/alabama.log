The imported infected cases can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/Population), suggesting weeks with lower fractions reduce imported infections. Arizona's E and I values show a somewhat stable but sustained infection level; thus, a strict-first pattern is adopted, frontloading stricter controls in early weeks to reduce immediate importation risk and relaxing controls slightly later. This balances epidemic control by minimizing early importation and mobility needs by gradually increasing flow. The fractions sum to exactly 1, ensuring total flow is conserved."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Alabama, inbound traffic allocations are coordinated across all origin states to reduce early importation of infected individuals, which has the greatest impact on epidemic dynamics. States with higher infected and exposed populations, especially those with large flows to Alabama such as Tennessee, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Arkansas, have stricter controls frontloaded in the initial weeks (strict-first pattern). This frontloading reduces immediate importation pressure, suppressing early seeding of infections in Alabama. For states with moderate or lower infection prevalence relative to population or lower inbound flows, even or relaxed-first patterns are used to maintain essential mobility while containing risk. The importation risk is proportional to Flow*ft*(I/Population), so adjusting ft weekly while keeping total flow constant allows temporal redistribution of risk. This temporal cooperation balances epidemic control and mobility needs, ensuring that total inbound flow remains unchanged but infection importation is minimized when Alabama is most vulnerable. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if underlying prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, more aggressive early restrictions would be necessary, whereas with lower prevalence or beta, more relaxed patterns might suffice. Allocations are sensitive to infection dynamics in origin states, emphasizing the need for real-time surveillance and adaptive policies. Overall, this coordinated, temporally modulated approach optimizes epidemic control in Alabama while preserving essential mobility functions."

The risk of importing infections to Alabama is proportional to the inbound flow and the infected ratio: imported_infected ~ Flow * fraction * (I / population). Arizona's inbound flow to Alabama is moderate (2658.59 daily). Given a slightly elevated infection prevalence, a strict-first pattern is used: stricter controls in the initial weeks to suppress early transmission, then gradually relaxing later weeks to balance mobility needs. This approach helps reduce seeding of infections early when Alabama's epidemic is still vulnerable. The fractions sum exactly to 1. This pattern balances epidemic control and economic activity by front-loading restrictions when risk is highest."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce imported infections and deaths in Alabama, the traffic control policy emphasizes early stringent restrictions on inbound flows from states with higher infection prevalence and large inbound flow volumes, such as Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Texas. The reasoning is that imported infections are approximately proportional to the product of inbound flow, the infected fraction in the origin state, and the traffic fraction allocated for each week. By implementing strict-first traffic patterns—lower fractions in the initial weeks followed by gradual relaxation—Alabama can effectively suppress seeding of new infections when its own epidemic is vulnerable. States with lower infected cases or smaller flows are given more balanced or relaxed-first patterns to maintain economic activity while keeping risk manageable. Quantitative risk balancing is evident: high-risk states have reduced early flows, while lower-risk states retain steadier mobility. The weekly allocation sums to 1 for each origin, ensuring total flow remains consistent with ground truth but is temporally shifted to mitigate early risk. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase in certain states, stricter initial controls should be enhanced to prevent surges. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxation could be tolerated early. This coordinated multi-state approach optimizes the trade-offs between epidemic control and economic mobility, minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Alabama over the next 8 weeks."

This cooperative temporal balancing across states ensures that total inbound traffic remains constant over 8 weeks, satisfying mobility demands while minimizing cumulative epidemic impact. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) rises, stricter controls in high-risk weeks become more critical. Conversely, if prevalence drops or beta decreases, traffic can be more evenly distributed. This adaptive approach maintains epidemic control efficacy while supporting economic needs.

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocations prioritize early stricter control (low fractions) in weeks 1 and 2 across all origin states, reflecting the goal to minimize immediate imported infections when epidemic prevalence is comparatively higher. The relaxed-first pattern allows mobility to gradually increase during later weeks, balancing epidemic control with economic and social activity restoration. Quantitatively, imported infections approximate Flow*ft*(I/S) for each origin state; thus, by lowering ft in early weeks, we reduce the initial infection pressure on Alabama's population. The sum-to-one constraint on fractions ensures the total inbound flow remains constant, preserving overall mobility while redistributing risk temporally. Cross-state cooperation is implicit: states with higher infection prevalence or larger flows (e.g., Tennessee, Mississippi, Texas) have relatively lower early week fractions, prioritizing epidemic control. States with lower prevalence adjust accordingly to permit slightly higher initial flows. Sensitivity analysis suggests if infection prevalence (I/S) or transmission rate (beta) were higher, stricter early controls (lower fractions in weeks 1-3) would be warranted to further reduce importation risk. Conversely, lower prevalence or beta might allow more uniform or relaxed patterns. This adaptive policy balances minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Alabama while maintaining reasonable mobility. The strategy reduces peak imported infections, flattens epidemic curves through temporal flow redistribution, and mitigates healthcare system overload risk. Overall, the policy is a data-driven, dynamic approach optimized for Alabama's epidemic and mobility context."

The relaxed-first pattern allows mobility to gradually increase during later weeks, balancing epidemic control with economic and social activity restoration. Quantitatively, imported infections approximate Flow*ft*(I/S) for each origin state; thus, by lowering ft in early weeks, we reduce the initial infection pressure on Alabama's population. The sum-to-one constraint on fractions ensures the total inbound flow remains constant, preserving overall mobility while redistributing risk temporally. Cross-state cooperation is implicit: states with higher infection prevalence or larger flows (e.g., Tennessee, Mississippi, Texas) have relatively lower early week fractions, prioritizing epidemic control. States with lower prevalence adjust accordingly to permit slightly higher initial flows. Sensitivity analysis suggests if infection prevalence (I/S) or transmission rate (beta) were higher, stricter early controls (lower fractions in weeks 1-3) would be warranted to further reduce importation risk. Conversely, lower prevalence or beta might allow more uniform or relaxed patterns. This adaptive policy balances minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Alabama while maintaining reasonable mobility. The strategy reduces peak imported infections, flattens epidemic curves through temporal flow redistribution, and mitigates healthcare system overload risk. Overall, the policy is a data-driven, dynamic approach optimized for Alabama's epidemic and mobility context."
