The imported infected can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / (S+E+I+Q+R+D)), thus higher inbound flows during weeks with lower infection prevalence increase risk to Tennessee. Given Alabama's fairly stable infection rates, a strict-first pattern is chosen to front-load stronger controls early (lower fractions in earlier weeks) allowing Tennessee time to reduce internal cases. This approach balances epidemic control and mobility by gradually relaxing controls as Tennessee's internal situation improves. The fractions sum to 1.000 exactly, validating correct distribution."

  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic control policy for Tennessee's inbound flows is designed to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically allocating weekly inbound traffic fractions from multiple origin states based on their infection prevalence, exposed populations, and mobility flows. States with higher infection pressure (higher I and E relative to population) such as Arkansas, Michigan, South Carolina, and Mississippi receive stricter controls earlier (strict-first pattern) to reduce imported infections during peak risk periods. This approach lowers the immediate epidemic pressure on Tennessee's healthcare system and limits seeding of new cases. Conversely, states with moderate or stable infection levels (e.g., Arizona, Indiana, Minnesota, Wisconsin) utilize even distributions to maintain mobility without large risk spikes. Some states with high exposed but lower infected counts (e.g., Idaho, Utah, Nebraska) follow relaxed-first patterns, concentrating flows mid-term when Tennessee's internal controls likely improve, balancing epidemic risk and economic activity. The policy ensures each origin's total inbound flow remains constant over 8 weeks but redistributes weekly proportions to reduce importation risk. Quantitatively, imported infections are proportional to Flow * ft * (I / population), so reducing ft during high-risk weeks curtails infections. Cross-state cooperation balances inbound flows weekly, smoothing risks and preventing simultaneous peaks from multiple origins. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission parameters (beta) increase, stricter and more front-loaded controls should be intensified, while lower prevalence permits relaxed controls. This dynamic traffic allocation mitigates epidemic spread effectively while preserving essential mobility and economic functions."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocations prioritize reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Tennessee by balancing epidemic risk and mobility needs across all origin states. States with higher infection prevalence (I) relative to population and higher inbound flow receive stricter traffic control in later weeks (strict-first pattern), to reduce importation risk during Tennessee's epidemic peaks. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or lower flow adopt relaxed-first or even traffic patterns to maintain economic activity early while tightening controls later to prevent resurgence. The total inbound flow from each origin state remains constant to preserve mobility baselines. The weekly fractions sum exactly to 1, ensuring no net change in total inbound volume but temporal redistribution. Quantitatively, expected imported infections are proportional to Flow * ft * (I/population), so reducing ft in weeks with higher Tennessee vulnerability reduces importation risk and consequent local transmission. This coordinated approach balances epidemic control with mobility by temporally redistributing flows to minimize overlap between peak infectious inflow and local vulnerability. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter controls (lower ft) in vulnerable weeks become more critical. Conversely, if prevalence drops or beta decreases, traffic can be more evenly distributed to enhance mobility. The policy thus dynamically aligns traffic controls with epidemiological data and mobility baselines, optimizing public health outcomes while sustaining essential travel and commerce."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocations for Tennessee are designed to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically balancing epidemic control and mobility needs across origin states and weeks. States with higher infection prevalence relative to their population, such as Idaho and Utah, receive a stricter early-week control to reduce initial imported infections, following a strict-first pattern. Conversely, states with lower relative infection levels or signs of epidemic stabilization, such as Arizona and Texas, adopt a relaxed-first approach, allowing more mobility in early weeks and tightening control later to prevent resurgence. For states with moderate prevalence, an almost even distribution of traffic control is adopted to avoid spikes in infection importation while sustaining steady mobility. Quantitatively, expected imported infections approximate Flow*ft*(I/population), guiding the week-wise adjustments of fractions. The sum of fractions for each state is precisely calibrated to 1 to preserve total inbound traffic volume while redistributing flow over time. This cooperative strategy balances the risk of epidemic seeding from multiple sources by temporally staggering and smoothing inbound flows, preventing healthcare overload and enabling targeted interventions. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early-week controls would be more beneficial, whereas decreasing prevalence allows for more relaxed policies.

States with higher infection prevalence relative to their population, such as Idaho and Utah, receive a stricter early-week control to reduce initial imported infections, following a strict-first pattern. Conversely, states with lower relative infection levels or signs of epidemic stabilization, such as Arizona and Texas, adopt a relaxed-first approach, allowing more mobility in early weeks and tightening control later to prevent resurgence. For states with moderate prevalence, an almost even distribution of traffic control is adopted to avoid spikes in infection importation while sustaining steady mobility. Quantitatively, expected imported infections approximate Flow*ft*(I/population), guiding the week-wise adjustments of fractions. The sum of fractions for each state is precisely calibrated to 1 to preserve total inbound traffic volume while redistributing flow over time. This cooperative strategy balances the risk of epidemic seeding from multiple sources by temporally staggering and smoothing inbound flows, preventing healthcare overload and enabling targeted interventions. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early-week controls would be more beneficial, whereas decreasing prevalence allows for more relaxed policies. Overall, this coordinated, data-informed approach optimizes epidemic mitigation in Tennessee by managing imported infection risks while maintaining essential mobility.'

  "global_guidance": "The overall cross-state strategy prioritizes minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Tennessee by modulating inbound traffic flows according to infection pressure in origin states. States with higher infected and exposed proportions relative to their populations receive stricter controls in earlier weeks (strict-first pattern), reducing initial importation risks that could seed outbreaks in Tennessee. Lower-risk states or those with smaller inflows adopt more even or relaxed-first patterns to balance economic and social mobility needs. The total inbound flow volume remains constant per origin to respect ground truth, but weekly proportions are adjusted to delay or reduce high-risk importations. This coordinated approach ensures that epidemic pressure is spread out over time, reducing peak infection importation and allowing Tennessee's local control measures to be more effective. Quantitatively, expected imported infections from each state scale with Flow * fraction * (I/population), so controlling fractions in weeks with higher infection prevalence reduces overall imported infection burden. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become more critical to prevent exponential growth within Tennessee. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, traffic can be relaxed earlier to support mobility. This dynamic allocation balances epidemic control with economic impact, leveraging temporal and spatial risk heterogeneity across states to optimize Tennessee's epidemic outcomes."
