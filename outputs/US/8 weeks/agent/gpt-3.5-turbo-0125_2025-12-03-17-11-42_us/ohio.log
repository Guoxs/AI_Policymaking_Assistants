The daily inbound flow is quite high at 20682.25, which poses a risk of importing infectious individuals. The expected imported infected individuals roughly scale with Flow*ft*(I/S), indicating that controlling flow in weeks with potentially higher infection spread is crucial. Given the steady infection levels, an even pattern with minor front-loaded strictness is chosen to maintain consistent control while allowing some mobility. This balances epidemic control and economic activity, reducing risk of sudden spikes in imported cases. The fractions sum to exactly 1, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocations reflect a strategy balancing epidemic control and mobility needs across all origin states. States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to their susceptible populations and higher daily inflows (e.g., Michigan, Kentucky, South Carolina, Tennessee) have been assigned relaxed-first patterns with stricter early controls to minimize initial importation risks and gradual relaxation as local control or immunity improves. States with moderate to low infection pressure and smaller inflows have even or strict-first patterns to maintain steady control without excessive mobility restrictions. The quantitative cooperation logic leverages the fact that total inbound flow over 8 weeks remains constant per state, but adjusting weekly fractions allows shifting mobility away from high-risk periods to lower-risk ones, effectively flattening importation risk peaks. This temporal redistribution reduces cumulative imported infections, thus minimizing transmission and deaths in Ohio. The approach is sensitive to changes in prevalence and transmission rate beta; higher prevalence or beta would justify stricter early controls and more front-loading of restrictions, while lower values could allow more relaxed patterns. In all cases, the fractions sum exactly to 1, ensuring no net change in total inbound flow, preserving economic activity while optimizing epidemic outcomes. This coordinated, state-specific yet system-wide adjusted policy helps Ohio mitigate imported infection risks effectively over the next 8 weeks."

The imported infections from Alabama can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population). Given a steady infection prevalence, an even pattern with slightly stricter controls in the first week (0.10) followed by relaxed but stable traffic flow is advisable to prevent sudden spikes. This approach balances epidemic control and mobility needs by slightly suppressing initial influx when Ohio's own infected population is significant.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations collectively aim to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Ohio by strategically modulating weekly inbound flows from various origin states based on their infection prevalence and population sizes.

States with low infection prevalence or large populations but low relative infection rates (e.g., Texas, Nebraska) have more even or relaxed patterns to maintain economic activity without significant epidemic risk. This cross-state coordination balances risk by front-loading stricter controls on higher-risk origins and easing later to allow mobility restoration, thereby reducing the overall imported infection burden. Quantitative cooperation logic involves distributing restrictions temporally and spatially to avoid overwhelming Ohio's healthcare system with imported cases, effectively flattening the epidemic curve. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter or prolonged controls early on may be necessary, while decreases permit relaxed flows sooner. Conversely, changes in mobility baselines affect the scale but not the relative patterns, reinforcing the importance of adaptive, data-driven policy. This approach ensures that the total inbound flow from each origin remains constant over 8 weeks, respecting economic constraints while prioritizing public health."

The imported infected estimate is proportional to Flow * ft * (I / population), so with a large population and low infection prevalence, the infection pressure is moderate. Given this, a strict-first pattern is chosen, applying stronger controls in the initial weeks when the Ohio outbreak is more vulnerable, gradually relaxing controls as Ohio's local epidemic is expected to stabilize.

  "global_guidance": "The overall traffic allocation strategy balances infection pressure from origin states and Ohio's epidemic trajectory to minimize cumulative cases and deaths. States with higher infection prevalence relative to their population and higher daily inbound flows receive stricter early controls (strict-first pattern) to reduce early seeding risk in Ohio, which is vital when Ohio's local epidemic is still vulnerable. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or significant economic ties with Ohio are allowed slightly relaxed early traffic to balance mobility needs, with tightening later to prevent resurgence. The sum of weekly fractions per state strictly equals 1, preserving total inbound flow and ensuring consistency with ground truth data. This cooperative approach distributes control efforts over time and space, reducing peak imported infections and smoothing importation pressure. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become even more critical, while lower beta allows more mobility. Coordination across states ensures that no single origin state disproportionately seeds Ohio's epidemic, leveraging temporal traffic modulation to flatten and delay importation peaks. This strategy optimizes epidemic control without excessive mobility disruption, supporting public health and economic objectives."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic control allocation across all origin states collectively aims to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Ohio by strategically modulating the weekly flow fractions. The primary risk metric considered is the expected imported infected cases, approximated as Flow*ft*(I/population) for each origin state. States with higher infection prevalence (I/population) and significant inflow to Ohio are allocated stricter control measures in the early weeks (strict-first pattern) to reduce the seeding of infections early and flatten the epidemic curve within Ohio. This front-loading of traffic restrictions helps delay and reduce the peak of imported infections, allowing Ohio's healthcare and tracing systems to better contain and manage outbreaks. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or inflow adopt a more balanced or slightly strict-first pattern to maintain necessary mobility and economic activity while still controlling risk. The fractions for each state sum exactly to one, ensuring the total inbound flow over the 8 weeks remains consistent with ground truth, maintaining overall mobility volume but redistributing temporally for epidemic control. Cross-state cooperation is critical, as reducing early importation from high-risk states mitigates the risk of secondary local transmission in Ohio. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) increases, stricter early control fractions would be more beneficial, while if these decrease, more even or relaxed patterns could suffice.

The primary risk metric considered is the expected imported infected cases, approximated as Flow*ft*(I/population) for each origin state. States with higher infection prevalence (I/population) and significant inflow to Ohio are allocated stricter control measures in the early weeks (strict-first pattern) to reduce the seeding of infections early and flatten the epidemic curve within Ohio. This front-loading of traffic restrictions helps delay and reduce the peak of imported infections, allowing Ohio's healthcare and tracing systems to better contain and manage outbreaks. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or inflow adopt a more balanced or slightly strict-first pattern to maintain necessary mobility and economic activity while still controlling risk. The fractions for each state sum exactly to one, ensuring the total inbound flow over the 8 weeks remains consistent with ground truth, maintaining overall mobility volume but redistributing temporally for epidemic control. Cross-state cooperation is critical, as reducing early importation from high-risk states mitigates the risk of secondary local transmission in Ohio. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) increases, stricter early control fractions would be more beneficial, while if these decrease, more even or relaxed patterns could suffice. This balanced approach considers epidemic dynamics, mobility needs, and economic impacts to optimally reduce disease spread into Ohio from multiple origin states."
