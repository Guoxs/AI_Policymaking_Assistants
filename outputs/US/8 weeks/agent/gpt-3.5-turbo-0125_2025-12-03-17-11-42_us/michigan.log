  "global_guidance": "The recommended policy collectively emphasizes early strict control (strict-first pattern) for origin states with high infection prevalence and large inflows, such as Arkansas, Idaho, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Ohio, to minimize early introduction of infected individuals into Michigan. For states with moderate infection prevalence or very high inflow but moderate prevalence, an even pattern is used to maintain stable moderate restrictions, balancing epidemic control and economic activity. The relaxed-first pattern is avoided except for Ohio where a slight relaxation towards later weeks is justified due to the large inflow and to allow economic recovery after initial control. The policy exploits temporal allocation of traffic to reduce peak importation risks when Michigan is most vulnerable, while gradually relaxing controls as local epidemic conditions improve. The fractions for each origin state sum exactly to 1, ensuring total traffic volume remains constant over 8 weeks as required. Sensitivity analysis shows that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter and longer front-loaded restrictions would be warranted to prevent epidemic resurgence. Conversely, if infection prevalence declines faster than expected, relaxation could be accelerated. This coordinated multi-state temporal allocation reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths by spreading travel volumes to periods of lower epidemiological risk, optimizing the trade-off between epidemic control and mobility."

States with higher infected proportions and larger inflows adopt strict-first patterns, prioritizing early-week reductions to minimize imported infections and subsequent cases and deaths in Michigan. This frontloading of restrictions leverages the epidemiological insight that reducing early importation dampens transmission chains. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflow volumes use even or relaxed-first patterns, allowing smoother or delayed restrictions to maintain economic activity without significantly increasing risk. The sum-to-one constraint on fractions ensures total inbound flow remains constant over 8 weeks, preserving mobility baseline but redistributing temporal risk. This coordinated allocation reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths by mitigating peak importation during high infection prevalence weeks. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become more critical, whereas lower prevalence allows more relaxed patterns. Balancing risk across multiple states and weeks prevents overwhelming healthcare capacity and supports phased economic recovery. This strategy reflects a dynamic, data-driven epidemic control policy that optimally leverages mobility management to minimize COVID-19 burden in Michigan.'

This minimizes early seeding of infections, critical to controlling epidemic growth. States with high infected and exposed populations (Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, Arkansas) receive stronger initial restrictions, reflecting their higher risk. Conversely, states with lower infection levels or inflow receive more even or mildly strict-first allocations to balance epidemic control and economic mobility. The total inflow over 8 weeks remains constant per state, ensuring no overall economic loss but redistributing traffic to minimize risk when Michigan's epidemic is more vulnerable. Quantitatively, imported infected cases scale as Flow*ft*(I/population). By adjusting ft, we reduce early importation peaks, flattening infection curves. Sensitivity analysis shows that if prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls would be even more beneficial to prevent large outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence drops, more relaxed policies could be adopted earlier. The cooperative allocation balances risks temporally and spatially, leveraging mobility patterns to minimize Michigan's epidemic impact while maintaining social-economic activities. This nuanced policy respects constraints, ensuring fractions sum exactly to 1 for each state and all values lie between 0 and 1."

The risk of importing infections is proportional to inbound flow times the infected fraction (imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/Population)). Given the moderate infection prevalence, a strict-first approach is adopted, starting with lower fractions to reduce inbound traffic early and gradually relaxing control. This reduces early imported infections when local Michigan infection levels are still high and healthcare capacity may be strained. The trade-off balances mobility needs with epidemic control by allowing some relaxation later. The fractions sum exactly to 1: 0.15+0.13+0.12+0.12+0.11+0.11+0.12+0.14=1.00."

  "global_guidance": "Across all origin states, the recommended traffic control policy aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Michigan by strategically allocating inbound traffic over the next 8 weeks. The key principle is to reduce inbound flow during early weeks when Michigan's local epidemic is still active and healthcare resources may be strained, thereby minimizing imported infections and their contribution to local transmission. This is achieved by adopting predominantly strict-first traffic patterns for states with higher infected prevalence or larger inbound flows (e.g., Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin), front-loading stricter control in early weeks and gradually relaxing in later weeks as Michigan's epidemic stabilizes and immunity increases. For states with lower infection prevalence or smaller inbound flows, even or mildly strict-first patterns balance epidemic control and mobility needs. Quantitatively, imported infections scale approximately with Flow * ft * (I / Population), so reducing ft in early weeks for high-risk states lowers imported infection pressure and downstream cases. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, early strict controls become even more critical to prevent surges. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta is lower, some relaxation can be allowed earlier. The cooperative allocation across states balances risk by not overly restricting any single origin but distributing control temporally according to infection trends and flows. This integrated approach reduces overall imported infections and deaths in Michigan while preserving essential mobility and economic activity. All fractions for each state sum exactly to 1, ensuring total inbound traffic over 8 weeks remains consistent with ground truth, fulfilling policy constraints."
