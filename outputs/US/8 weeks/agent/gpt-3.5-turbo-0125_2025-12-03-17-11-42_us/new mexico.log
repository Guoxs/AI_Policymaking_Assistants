    "notes": "Alabama shows moderate exposed (E=1353) and infected (I=409) populations compared to its large susceptible population (S=4877052). The risk of importing infections is proportional to inbound flow times the infected ratio (imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/S+E+I+...)). Given the relatively low infection prevalence, a strict-first pattern is chosen to front-load restrictions, reducing inbound flow fractions in the initial weeks (0.05 to 0.13) to limit early seeding of infections in New Mexico. Later weeks see relaxed controls to balance economic needs. This pattern optimizes epidemic control by suppressing importation when risk is higher while maintaining total flow constant (sum fractions = 1). The trade-off balances public health with mobility by delaying some travel rather than forbidding it altogether. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000."

As the largest contributor of inbound flow to New Mexico (31082), imported infections are a major concern. We apply a strict-first pattern with very low fractions in initial weeks (0.02 to 0.1) and gradually relax controls in later weeks to minimize initial seeding risk. This approach reduces early imported infections when New Mexico's own infections are still substantial, helping to flatten the curve. The sum of fractions is exactly 1.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policy across origin states to New Mexico collectively adopts a strict-first traffic allocation pattern. This means traffic inflow fractions start low in the first weeks and gradually increase in later weeks. This approach is justified by the goal to minimize imported infections and subsequent deaths in New Mexico during the critical early phase of the epidemic when local infections are still spreading. Quantitatively, imported infections from each origin state are approximately proportional to the product of inbound flow, the fraction of infected and exposed individuals in the origin state's population, and the weekly flow fraction. By concentrating stricter controls in early weeks, the policy reduces the seeding of infections that could exponentially increase local transmission. Conversely, relaxing controls in later weeks helps recover mobility and economic activity without significantly raising epidemic risk, as initial seeding is suppressed and local immunity may build. The interplay of different states' prevalence and flow volumes informs the relative strictness and timing of controls; states with higher infection prevalence and larger flows (e.g., Arizona, Texas) have more stringent initial restrictions, while states with lower prevalence or smaller flows have milder restrictions. This cooperative allocation balances epidemic risk and mobility across states and weeks. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence increases or transmission rate beta rises, stricter early controls should be reinforced to prevent imported outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence or beta decreases, more relaxed allocations can be considered. This flexible yet principled approach ensures robust epidemic control while preserving essential mobility."

    "notes": "Alabama's infection pressure is relatively low with I=434 compared to its large susceptible population S=4,850,887. The imported infected cases can be roughly estimated as Flow*ft*(I/Population), which given the large population, results in low infection risk per traveler. However, the large average flow into New Mexico (1804.6 daily) means even a small fraction of infected travelers can impact New Mexico significantly. Therefore, a strict-first pattern is chosen, applying stricter controls in the early weeks (lower fractions 0.15,0.15,0.13) to reduce early imported infections, then gradually relaxing as the local epidemic is expected to stabilize. This balances epidemic control and mobility by reducing early seeding of cases while allowing some mobility later when risk decreases. The fractions sum exactly to 1.0000."

It has the highest daily average inflow into New Mexico (26987.7), so importation risk is significant.

A relaxed-first pattern is less suitable as Arizona's infection prevalence is not rapidly declining. Instead, a strict-first pattern is chosen to curb early imported infections, then gradually relaxing control in later weeks as New Mexico's local epidemic improves. Trade-off favors early epidemic control given Arizona's high flow. The fractions sum exactly to 1.0000."

  "global_guidance": "The allocation of inbound traffic fractions across all origin states carefully balances the trade-off between epidemic control and maintaining mobility. States with higher infected and exposed populations, and/or higher daily inflow volumes, are assigned stricter controls early (lower fractions in initial weeks) to reduce the importation of infectious individuals and thereby minimize secondary transmission and deaths in New Mexico. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure or smaller inflow volumes have more even traffic distributions to avoid unnecessary economic disruption. The strict-first pattern dominates for states with high infection prevalence, reflecting the importance of controlling early seeding events when New Mexico is most vulnerable. Even patterns are applied when infection risk is moderate or low, balancing mobility and epidemic risk. The sum of fractions for each state is rigorously maintained at exactly 1.0000 to preserve total inbound traffic volumes, meeting the constraint that total flow over 8 weeks remains constant. This approach leverages quantitative logic where imported infections are proportional to the product of flow, fraction, and the infected prevalence (I/population) of the origin state. By shifting traffic away from weeks with higher infection prevalence, the policy reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become even more critical to prevent epidemic growth. If prevalence falls, the policy can safely relax controls earlier, allowing economic activity to resume. Overall, coordinated cross-state traffic shaping, emphasizing early restrictions on high-risk origin states and preserving mobility from low-risk states, optimizes New Mexico's epidemic outcomes while minimizing social and economic costs."

The exposed (E=1,680) and confirmed (Q=15,921) numbers are moderate, indicating moderate epidemic pressure. Given the very high average daily inflow (~1,446), the expected imported infections roughly follow imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/population). To minimize epidemic risk while maintaining mobility, a balanced 'even' allocation with slight relaxation towards later weeks is chosen to avoid overwhelming local healthcare capacity. Early weeks have relatively stricter control (fractions around 0.10-0.12), gradually relaxing in later weeks to 0.14, reflecting a cautious approach given moderate infection prevalence. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000, validating distribution."

With a very large average inflow (~36,895), imported infections risk is high. The formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/population) suggests that strict early control reduces early seeding of cases. Thus, a 'relaxed-first' pattern is chosen, starting with strict control (fraction 0.05) and gradually relaxing to 0.19 in week 8, balancing epidemic control and economic needs. This phased approach allows initial suppression to reduce incidence before allowing higher mobility. Fractions sum precisely to 1.000, ensuring total flow consistency."

  "global_guidance": "The collective strategy across all origin states prioritizes reducing the early-week imported infections into New Mexico when local susceptible population remains high and healthcare capacity is vulnerable. States with high infected and exposed counts, such as Arizona, Texas, Michigan, and Utah, receive stricter early-week traffic controls (lower fractions in early weeks) to minimize initial seeding events that could accelerate local outbreaks and deaths. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or inflow are managed with more even distributions or mild early relaxations, balancing mobility needs and epidemic risk. This cross-state risk-based traffic allocation minimizes New Mexico's cumulative imported infections by targeting high-risk periods and origins. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections scale as sum over states of Flow * ft * (I/population), so reducing early ft for high I states significantly reduces the total infection pressure early when New Mexico's local epidemic is sensitive. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early controls should be emphasized further, whereas if these decrease, more relaxed or even distributions could be permissible.

States with high infected and exposed counts, such as Arizona, Texas, Michigan, and Utah, receive stricter early-week traffic controls (lower fractions in early weeks) to minimize initial seeding events that could accelerate local outbreaks and deaths. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or inflow are managed with more even distributions or mild early relaxations, balancing mobility needs and epidemic risk. This cross-state risk-based traffic allocation minimizes New Mexico's cumulative imported infections by targeting high-risk periods and origins. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections scale as sum over states of Flow * ft * (I/population), so reducing early ft for high I states significantly reduces the total infection pressure early when New Mexico's local epidemic is sensitive. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early controls should be emphasized further, whereas if these decrease, more relaxed or even distributions could be permissible. This adaptive, risk-informed traffic control policy optimizes the trade-off between epidemic suppression and preserving essential mobility and economic activity over the next 8 weeks."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control strategy across all origin states for New Mexico employs predominantly strict-first traffic allocation patterns, especially for states with higher infection and exposed populations and higher inbound flow to New Mexico. This approach frontloads stricter traffic controls in the early weeks to minimize early seeding of infections which can exponentially increase local transmission and deaths. By enforcing stricter controls when the risk of importing infected travelers is highest, the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in New Mexico are expected to be minimized. States with lower infection prevalence and lower flow see more balanced or even distributions to maintain essential mobility while controlling risk. Quantitatively, imported infections scale roughly with Flow multiplied by the fraction ft and the prevalence of infected individuals (I/population) in the origin states. Balancing the total flow to remain constant but shifting proportions over the 8 weeks allows temporal risk management, preventing spikes in imported infections. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase in any origin state, stricter front-loaded controls become even more crucial to prevent overwhelming New Mexico's healthcare system. Conversely, if prevalence declines faster, controls can be relaxed sooner. This coordinated temporal and cross-state allocation of inbound flow effectively balances epidemic control and economic mobility, reducing overall health burden while allowing gradual reopening. The sum of fractions for each state is exactly 1.000, ensuring total inbound flow remains consistent with ground truth data."
