The imported infection risk is proportional to flow * fraction * (I / total population). Given Alabama's sizable inbound flow (29,824 daily), early weeks apply stricter control (lower fractions) to curb initial importation, gradually relaxing as the epidemic pressure reduces. The pattern is strict-first, prioritizing early containment to protect Arkansas. This balances epidemic control with the economic need for mobility.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies for Arkansas prioritize minimizing imported infections and subsequent deaths by adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions from each origin state while keeping total flow constant. States with higher infected and exposed populations, particularly those with large inbound flows like Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and Tennessee, receive stricter early week controls (low fractions in initial weeks) to reduce early introduction of infections into Arkansas. This strict-first pattern helps suppress initial epidemic seeding, which is critical given the exponential nature of disease spread. Conversely, states with lower infected or exposed populations or smaller inbound flows adopt more balanced or even distributions to avoid unnecessary economic disruption. The weekly fractions always sum to 1 per state, ensuring the total 8-week inflow remains constant, preserving mobility baselines overall. This approach balances epidemic control and economic activity by concentrating restrictions early when infection pressure and risk of importation are highest, then gradually relaxing as risk diminishes. Cross-state coordination is crucial: by collectively reducing early week flows from high-risk states, Arkansas reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, a stricter early control becomes even more critical, while lower prevalence allows more relaxed policies. The strategies leverage SEIQRD parameters and population compositions to quantify risk, adjusting fractions to minimize overall impact while respecting mobility needs."

    "notes": "Alabama shows a very low number of infected individuals (I=434) relative to its large susceptible population (S=4850887), indicating relatively low infection pressure. However, the exposed count (E=1386) and confirmed cases (Q=12195) suggest some transmission risk. The imported infected estimate is roughly Flow*ft*(I/population), where population is sum of compartments, indicating risk proportional to fraction ft and flow. Given stable infection pressure, an even pattern with slightly stricter control in the earliest week (f1=0.10) is chosen to curb immediate imported infections. This balances mobility needs as Alabama's inflow to Arkansas is substantial (14795.98 daily) and strict reduction would heavily impact travel and economy. The fractions sum to exactly 1, ensuring total flow remains constant while slightly redistributing traffic to later weeks with modest relaxation."

The daily inflow to Arkansas is smaller (3294.46) but still meaningful. The imported infected load is proportional to flow, fraction, and prevalence (I/population). A relaxed-first pattern is adopted here, with increasing fractions over the initial weeks to allow gradual traffic increase as local conditions stabilize, minimizing sudden spikes of imported cases. This approach balances reducing immediate import risk and supporting sustained mobility. The fractions sum to exactly 1."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Arkansas, the traffic control policy balances infection pressure from origin states with their inbound flow volumes. States with higher infection prevalence (I/population) and large inflows, such as Oklahoma, Texas, Tennessee, Idaho, Michigan, Utah, and Wisconsin, receive stricter control in early weeks (lower fractions) to reduce initial imported infections, reflecting a strict-first pattern. This delays and lowers infection import pressure, allowing Arkansas' epidemic control measures to be more effective. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or smaller inflows, such as Iowa, Nebraska, South Carolina, and Virginia, adopt relaxed-first or even patterns to sustain mobility with manageable risk. The quantitative cooperation logic ensures that the total inbound flow over 8 weeks remains constant per origin state, preserving travel demand while redistributing traffic to optimize epidemic outcomes. Weekly fraction adjustments balance immediate importation risk and longer-term mobility needs, smoothing potential peaks of imported infections. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases in source states, stricter early week controls become more critical, whereas lower prevalence allows more uniform traffic distribution. This adaptive approach supports epidemic control by reducing imported cases and deaths while maintaining economic and social functions through calibrated mobility policies across states and weeks."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the traffic control policy employs a mix of strict-first, relaxed-first, and even patterns across origin states based on their epidemic pressure measured by exposed and infected populations relative to susceptible populations. States with high infected and exposed counts and large inflow volumes, such as Texas, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama, have stricter control in early weeks to minimize the importation of infections into Arkansas, which is critical for reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. States with lower infection pressure or smaller inflow volumes have more balanced or relaxed patterns to maintain economic activity and travel needs. The total inbound flow from each origin state remains constant over the 8 weeks, ensuring fairness and predictability in traffic management. This cross-state cooperation balances infection risk and mobility, reducing the overall epidemic burden. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early traffic control fractions would further reduce cases, while if prevalence decreases, more relaxed patterns could be considered without significant risk. The chosen patterns reflect a cautious approach prioritizing early mitigation of imported infections, given that early seeded cases have disproportionate impact on epidemic trajectories. This strategy aligns with SEIQRD dynamics, emphasizing early reduction in exposed and infected inflow to Arkansas to minimize onward transmission and deaths."

The expected imported infected cases correlate with the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population); with Alabama's moderate infection prevalence, a slight reduction early on helps curb initial case importation. We adopt a strict-first pattern, imposing stricter controls in the initial weeks to reduce immediate seeding, then gradually relaxing.

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce expected imported infections and deaths in Arkansas, the traffic control policy strategically modulates weekly inbound flow from origin states based on their infection prevalence and total inflow volumes. States with high infected populations relative to their susceptible base, such as Idaho and Utah, receive stricter controls in early weeks (strict-first pattern) to minimize the seeding of infections, as imported infected cases scale approximately with Flow * ft * (I / population). Conversely, states with low infection prevalence and lower inflow volumes adopt more relaxed or even flow patterns to preserve economic and social mobility while still controlling risks. The traffic allocations across states and weeks are designed to sum to exactly 1, ensuring total inbound traffic volume remains constant, preserving mobility baselines while redistributing risk temporally. This temporal balancing allows Arkansas to reduce peak infection importation pressure and flatten epidemic curves, which should reduce cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, early strict controls gain importance to contain importation risk. Conversely, if local control within Arkansas improves or prevalence decreases, traffic can be relaxed earlier to support mobility. This cooperative strategy across multiple origin states optimizes epidemic control while minimizing socioeconomic disruption."
