  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocation across states aims to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Oklahoma by strategically adjusting weekly traffic fractions while keeping total 8-week inbound volume constant per state. States with higher infectious prevalence (I) relative to their populations and higher inbound flows receive stricter traffic controls in the early weeks (strict-first pattern), which lowers the immediate importation pressure, curbing potential seeding events that can trigger exponential growth locally. This front-loaded restriction is critical because early imported infections can rapidly amplify in Oklahoma's population. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or lower inbound flows adopt more even or mildly relaxed first patterns, balancing epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs. This cooperation logic leverages temporal balancing of infection risk across weeks and origins, ensuring that strict controls early do not overly burden any single week or state, but collectively reduce the overall infection importation risk. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) were higher, stricter early controls would be even more critical, while lower prevalence or beta could permit more relaxed patterns. The chosen patterns also consider trade-offs between economic impact and epidemic control. The precise fractional allocations sum to exactly 1 for each state, ensuring compliance with constraints and preserving total inbound volumes. This harmonized approach optimizes epidemic mitigation in Oklahoma by mitigating imported infection risks through temporally adaptive, state-specific traffic policies."

Imported infected individuals can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population), indicating that a higher inbound flow fraction ft in weeks with higher infection prevalence leads to increased risk. Given the relatively steady infection numbers, a strict-first traffic control pattern is chosen to reduce flow in the initial weeks to suppress imported infection pressure early. This approach balances epidemic control by minimizing early seeding cases in Oklahoma while relaxing controls slightly later to sustain mobility.

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic control policy for Oklahoma strategically adjusts weekly fractions for each origin state to minimize imported infections and subsequent local transmissions. By considering the infected proportion (I/population) in each state, we allocate stricter controls (lower fractions) during weeks with higher infection pressure to reduce seeding risk. States with higher infection prevalence or larger infected counts are assigned stricter-first patterns to suppress early importation, thereby reducing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Oklahoma. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or improving trends employ even or relaxed-first patterns to balance epidemic control and economic activity. This cooperation logic ensures the total inbound flow per origin remains constant, preserving mobility volume but redistributing it temporally to reduce peak importation risk. Sensitivity to parameter variations (e.g., transmission rate beta, infection prevalence changes) is addressed by prioritizing early strict control in states with higher infection levels, which is robust against moderate fluctuations. If beta or prevalence increases, stricter early control becomes more critical to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence declines, more relaxed patterns may be feasible. Overall, this coordinated, differentiated temporal modulation of inbound traffic enables effective epidemic control in Oklahoma through managing imported infection risks while maintaining essential mobility flows."

The imported infected cases can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population), indicating that the risk scales with inbound flow and infectious prevalence. Given this, a strict-first pattern is chosen to front-load stronger controls in the initial weeks when imported infections could seed outbreaks in Oklahoma. Alabama's inbound flow is moderate at ~3737 daily. By reducing inflow in the first 4 weeks (sum fractions ~0.37) and relaxing gradually later, we minimize early imported infections while balancing mobility needs over time. The fractions sum exactly to 1, ensuring total flow is preserved."

Quantitatively, imported infections scale as Flow * ft * (I / population) for each origin state. By reducing ft in early weeks, we reduce immediate transmission pressure. The large inflows from states like Texas and Arkansas necessitate careful balancing; hence, Texas has a slightly more even pattern to maintain critical mobility given its economic significance, while Arkansas receives stricter early restrictions.

  "global_guidance": "The overall traffic control strategy for Oklahoma prioritizes minimizing imported infections and deaths by adjusting the weekly inbound fractions from each origin state while keeping total inbound flow constant. States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to their susceptible populations, such as Arkansas, Texas, Michigan, and Ohio, are assigned strict-first patterns with lower inbound traffic fractions early on to reduce initial infection pressure, gradually relaxing restrictions in later weeks to balance economic needs. States with lower infection pressure or smaller inflow volumes receive even or relaxed-first patterns to maintain mobility while managing risk. This strategy leverages the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population), using infection prevalence (I/population) and inflow magnitude (Flow) to allocate controls temporally. By smoothing controls across weeks and states, cumulative infections and deaths in Oklahoma are minimized through risk balancing and epidemic suppression. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls would be necessary, while lower prevalence allows more relaxed policies. Cooperation across states and adaptive timing of restrictions optimizes epidemic control while preserving essential mobility and economic activity. The fractions for each state sum exactly to 1 to ensure total inbound flow remains consistent, facilitating predictable planning and enforcement."
