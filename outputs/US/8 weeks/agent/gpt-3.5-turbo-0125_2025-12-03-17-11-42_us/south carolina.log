The imported infections can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population), where population is sum of compartments. Given inflow of ~15904 daily, strict controls early (weeks 1-4) reduce immediate risk of seeding infections in South Carolina, where current infection levels are non-negligible (I=2505). The traffic control pattern is strict-first to minimize early importation risks, gradually relaxing as infection pressure decreases or stabilizes. This balances epidemic control by preventing surges from imported cases while allowing some mobility later. The sum of fractions is exactly 1, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant."

  "global_guidance": "Considering all origin states collectively, the traffic control policy aims to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in South Carolina by strategically adjusting weekly inbound traffic fractions. The core rationale revolves around the relationship: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population). States with higher infected and exposed populations pose greater risks of importing infections. Early weeks see stricter controls (lower ft) for high-risk states to prevent immediate seeding of cases in South Carolina, which itself has a non-trivial infected population (I=2505). States with lower infection pressure or lower inflow adopt more relaxed or even distribution patterns to preserve economic and social mobility. This cross-state balancing reduces the peak importation risk while maintaining total flow, ensuring no net loss in mobility over the 8-week period. The weekly distribution of fractions is designed to spread risk temporally, preventing sharp spikes in imported infections. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if the transmission rate (beta) or prevalence changes, the strictness and timing of controls would adjust accordingly; higher beta or prevalence warrants stronger early restrictions. Conversely, lower infection pressure allows more mobility early. This coordinated approach across states mitigates the cumulative epidemic burden effectively while respecting socio-economic needs. The fractions for each state sum exactly to 1, preserving total inbound flow and ensuring policy coherence."

Using the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population), we see that imported infections scale with traffic and prevalence. To reduce imported infections, stricter controls early (lower fractions) are applied when infections are more impactful. The pattern is relaxed-first, gradually easing restrictions toward week 8 to balance mobility and control. Traffic is deferred to later weeks when the epidemic impact may lessen or vaccination coverage increases. The fractions sum to exactly 1, ensuring total flow remains constant over 8 weeks."

  "global_guidance": "The overall policy aims to minimize imported infections and deaths in South Carolina by strategically adjusting inbound traffic fractions over the next 8 weeks while keeping total inbound flow constant per origin state. States with higher infection and exposure prevalence (e.g., Utah, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee) adopt stricter controls in early weeks (lower fractions, strict-first or relaxed-first patterns) to reduce early seeding of cases, mitigating epidemic acceleration. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or infection pressure (e.g., Kentucky, Iowa, Nebraska) follow more even or relaxed-first patterns, allowing smoother mobility and economic activity. Quantitatively, imported infections approximately scale with the product of flow, weekly fraction, and infected proportion (I/population). By allocating lower fractions to weeks with higher infection prevalence or epidemic pressure, the policy reduces importation risk when it matters most. Coordination across states balances importation risk over time, preventing overwhelming local healthcare or causing uncontrolled outbreaks. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls would be even more critical. Variations in mobility baselines impact the absolute imported infections but the temporal fraction allocation pattern remains robust to preserve epidemic control. This policy respects the constraint that fractions sum exactly to 1 per origin state, conserving overall flow, while dynamically modulating weekly risk exposure, thus providing an optimal balance between epidemic mitigation and mobility needs for South Carolina."

The risk of importing infections is proportional to the inbound flow times the fraction allocated weekly and the infected ratio (imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population)). Given the steady infection level, a slightly strict-first pattern is chosen, imposing stronger controls in earlier weeks (12%) and gradually relaxing to 10% in week 8 to minimize early seeding of infections in South Carolina. This approach balances epidemic control by reducing imported cases upfront while allowing gradual mobility recovery. The fractions sum precisely to 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "The overall traffic control policy across all origin states aims to minimize imported infections and consequent cases and deaths in South Carolina by strategically adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions. States with higher infected and exposed populations, such as Idaho, Utah, and Arkansas, receive stricter controls earlier in the 8-week horizon (strict-first pattern) to suppress initial seeding of infections, which is critical in preventing exponential growth locally. Conversely, states with moderate or lower infection prevalence, or where economic considerations favor early mobility, adopt relaxed-first or even patterns, allowing more inbound flow initially and tightening controls later to prepare for potential epidemic spikes. The quantitative logic underlying these decisions is that imported infections are approximately proportional to the product of inbound flow, weekly fraction, and the infected prevalence in the origin state (imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population)). By allocating lower fractions when infection risk is highest, the policy reduces the expected number of imported infections and thus downstream confirmed cases and deaths. The weekly balancing of fractions across states and weeks also prevents overwhelming local healthcare capacity and supports gradual adaptation of mobility levels. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission parameters (beta) increase unexpectedly, stricter early controls would become more critical, reinforcing the benefit of front-loaded strictness in high-risk states. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccination improves, the policy allows progressive relaxation to restore economic activity. This coordinated, adaptive approach across all origin states ensures that total inbound flow remains constant while minimizing public health risks, balancing mobility and epidemic control optimally."
