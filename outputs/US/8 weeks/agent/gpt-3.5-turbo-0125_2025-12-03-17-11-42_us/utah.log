The imported infections can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / Population), suggesting that even with moderate flow, the expected imported infected cases remain low. Given the steady low infection pressure, a relaxed-first pattern is chosen to allow more mobility in later weeks, as infection risk appears stable or declining. Early weeks have stricter control (fractions ~0.10) to mitigate any initial risk, gradually relaxing controls to fractions up to 0.21 by week 8. This balances epidemic control and mobility needs, minimizing new infections while supporting economic activity. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000, ensuring consistent total flow over the 8 weeks."

The imported infections are proportional to Flow * ft * (I / Population), so higher flows or infection rates increase risk. Since the infected count is moderate but mobility is substantial (daily inflow ~23,849), we apply a relaxed-first pattern with stricter controls initially (fractions 0.07-0.12) to reduce initial seeding, then gradually relax controls (up to 0.20) as the epidemic stabilizes or declines.

The imported infections scale with Flow * ft * (I / Population), implying a high risk for disease importation.

The imported infected cases are proportional to Flow * ft * (I / Population), and with a large average daily inflow (~63,858), this poses a considerable risk. Therefore, a relaxed-first pattern is chosen with stricter controls in the early weeks (fractions 0.06-0.12) to reduce initial importation risk, gradually relaxing controls in later weeks (up to 0.18).

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Utah, the traffic control allocations collectively aim to reduce the early-week importation of infected individuals from all origin states, as early seeding can lead to exponential local transmission. The strategy employs stricter traffic controls in initial weeks for states with high infection prevalence or large inflows (e.g., Texas, Idaho, Michigan, Tennessee), following a relaxed-first pattern that gradually eases restrictions to balance mobility and economic activity. States with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflows (e.g., Iowa, Mississippi) adopt even or slightly relaxed patterns to maintain steady control without excessive mobility disruption. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections per week approximate Flow * ft * (I / Population), so lowering ft in early weeks for high-risk states effectively reduces imported infection pressure when Utah's local epidemic is most vulnerable. This coordinated approach balances epidemic control and mobility by distributing risk over time and states, preventing overwhelming surges. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls or longer duration restrictions would be warranted. Conversely, if prevalence or transmissibility decrease, allocations could shift toward more relaxed control. The allocation fractions sum exactly to 1 per state to ensure that total inbound flow remains constant over the 8-week period, preserving essential mobility while mitigating epidemic risk."

Low prevalence states or those with smaller flows receive more even or relaxed-first patterns to balance economic activity and epidemic control. Quantitatively, imported infected cases approximate Flow*ft*(I/population), so concentrating stricter controls in weeks where prevalence or flow is highest reduces cumulative cases and deaths effectively. The allocation spreads traffic to avoid overwhelming the local health system while preserving essential mobility. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter or longer control periods would be required, especially for high-flow states. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, controls can be relaxed earlier. This cooperative balancing across states and weeks ensures Utah manages imported cases optimally, minimizing epidemic burden while sustaining mobility and economic functions. All fractions sum to 1 per state, confirming precise and valid traffic allocation."

The expected imported infections from Alabama to Utah can be approximated by Flow * ft * (I / total_population), where total_population is the sum of all compartments. Given the low infection prevalence, a strict-first pattern is chosen to front-load stricter controls, gradually relaxing over 8 weeks. This reduces early infection pressure on Utah's susceptible population while allowing mobility to increase as the risk diminishes. The trade-off balances the need to protect Utah's population with economic and mobility considerations. The fractions sum exactly to 1, ensuring consistent total flow."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Utah, inbound traffic allocations from all origin states are coordinated to reduce early imported infection pressure. States with higher infection prevalence or exposed populations, such as Arizona, Texas, Michigan, and Ohio, have stricter inbound traffic controls in the initial weeks (strict-first pattern), which gradually relax as the epidemic risk diminishes. This phased approach reduces the seeding of new infections in Utah when the local susceptible population is large and vulnerable. States with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflows adopt even or slightly strict-first patterns to maintain steady control without excessive mobility disruption. By ensuring the fractions sum to 1 for each state, the total inbound flow remains consistent, preserving economic and social connectivity while strategically timing restrictions. This coordinated temporal distribution of traffic controls balances epidemic control with mobility needs. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, more aggressive front-loading of restrictions would be beneficial to prevent imported cases. Conversely, if prevalence drops or vaccination increases, controls can be relaxed earlier. The approach also considers that imported exposed and infected individuals contribute differently to transmission dynamics, hence timing restrictions to coincide with peak infectiousness reduces secondary transmission risk.

States with higher infection prevalence or exposed populations, such as Arizona, Texas, Michigan, and Ohio, have stricter inbound traffic controls in the initial weeks (strict-first pattern), which gradually relax as the epidemic risk diminishes. This phased approach reduces the seeding of new infections in Utah when the local susceptible population is large and vulnerable. States with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflows adopt even or slightly strict-first patterns to maintain steady control without excessive mobility disruption. By ensuring the fractions sum to 1 for each state, the total inbound flow remains consistent, preserving economic and social connectivity while strategically timing restrictions. This coordinated temporal distribution of traffic controls balances epidemic control with mobility needs. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, more aggressive front-loading of restrictions would be beneficial to prevent imported cases. Conversely, if prevalence drops or vaccination increases, controls can be relaxed earlier. The approach also considers that imported exposed and infected individuals contribute differently to transmission dynamics, hence timing restrictions to coincide with peak infectiousness reduces secondary transmission risk. Overall, this policy leverages cross-state epidemiological data and mobility baselines to optimize inbound traffic control and protect Utah's population."

The expected imported infections roughly follow the formula: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population). Given the moderate infection level and moderate inflow (1296.2 daily), a relaxed-first pattern is chosen to gradually increase mobility while initially enforcing stricter controls to mitigate early importation risk. This balances epidemic control with economic mobility, moderately restricting early weeks to reduce initial imported infections but allowing some relaxation later to sustain traffic volume.

  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic allocation across origin states aims to minimize imported infections and deaths in Utah by strategically adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions while keeping total flow constant. States with higher infection prevalence or large daily inflow, such as Idaho, Arizona, Texas, and New Mexico, receive stricter traffic control in early weeks (strict-first pattern) to reduce immediate importation risk. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflow, like Alabama, Kentucky, and Mississippi, adopt more relaxed-first or even patterns to maintain mobility and economic activity. The expected imported infections scale with the product of daily inflow, weekly fraction, and infection prevalence (I/population). Balancing this across states and weeks, we spread risk to avoid high import peaks, flattening potential case surges. Sensitivity to epidemiological parameters like transmission rate (beta) and exposed to infected transition (alpha) suggests that increased transmission risk would warrant stricter early controls, while lower risk allows more relaxation. The approach balances epidemic control and mobility, considering each origin state's dynamics and flow volumes. Fractions sum exactly to 1.0000 for each state, ensuring no change in total inbound flow volume but temporal redistribution to optimize disease containment."
