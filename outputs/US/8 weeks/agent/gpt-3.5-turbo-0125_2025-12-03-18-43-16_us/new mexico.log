The infected proportion is very small, thus the risk of importing infected individuals is moderate. The expected imported infected is proportional to Flow * ft * (I/Population), so with large flow, even low prevalence can bring some risk. The traffic pattern chosen is even to maintain steady control without causing sudden spikes in risk across weeks. This balances epidemic control and mobility, avoiding sudden disruptions or relaxations. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (8*0.125=1)."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies for inbound flows into New Mexico from 19 origin states collectively aim to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by balancing epidemic risk and mobility needs. States with higher infected and exposed proportions relative to their populations and/or large inflows to New Mexico are given stricter early controls (low fractions in initial weeks) to reduce immediate importation risk. For example, Texas and South Carolina have massive inflows and notable infected counts, so strict-first patterns are applied. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or where infection trends suggest declining risk are allowed relaxed-first or even patterns, gradually increasing mobility while monitoring risk. The total flow from each origin state remains constant over the 8 weeks, ensuring no overall mobility loss but redistributing it to weeks with lower risk. The patterns chosen (strict-first, relaxed-first, or even) depend on infection pressure trends, inflow magnitude, and balancing trade-offs between epidemic control and economic mobility. Quantitatively, imported infected cases are approximated by Flow * ft * (I/Population), so adjusting the weekly fractions ft modulates infection import risk temporally. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls are more beneficial, while if prevalence declines faster, relaxed patterns may suffice. The collective approach across multiple states reduces peak importation risk, smoothing importation flows to prevent overwhelming New Mexico's health system and reducing secondary transmission. This coordinated, data-driven allocation of inbound traffic fractions optimizes epidemic control while preserving essential mobility."

    "notes": "Alabama has a very large susceptible population (4,855,423) but a relatively low number of infected individuals (336) and exposed (1,071) compared to its population, indicating moderate infection pressure. The imported infections can be roughly estimated as Flow * ft * (I / Population), so with a low I/Pop ratio (~0.000069) and large flow (1804 avg daily), the risk per traveler is low but non-negligible. Given the steady low infection prevalence, a strict-first pattern is chosen to front-load restrictions to quickly reduce seeding risk early on, assuming initial weeks have higher transmission risk globally. This also balances mobility needs by gradually relaxing controls in later weeks. The fractions sum exactly to 1.0, ensuring total flow preservation."

  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic allocation strategy for New Mexico prioritizes minimizing imported infections by adjusting weekly inbound flows from each origin state based on their infection pressure and flow magnitude. States with high infection prevalence and large average daily flows, such as Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Ohio, receive strict-first patterns with lower initial fractions to reduce early seeding risk, then progressively relaxed to balance mobility needs. States with moderate or low infection pressure and lower flows, including Alaska, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, generally receive even distribution patterns to maintain steady control without sharp restrictions. This cross-state approach ensures that the total imported infection risk is balanced across time and sources, preventing surges in cases that could overwhelm New Mexico's healthcare. Quantitatively, the imported infected cases scale with the product of flow, fraction, and infection prevalence (I/population), so reducing early fractions from high-risk states cuts early seeding. The gradual relaxation in later weeks helps mitigate economic and social impacts of strict mobility controls. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls would be more beneficial, emphasizing front-loading restrictions. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, mobility could be relaxed earlier. Overall, this coordinated temporal and spatial allocation of inbound traffic aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in New Mexico while preserving necessary mobility."

The expected imported infections can be estimated roughly as imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), where the infectious proportion is quite low. Given the relatively stable and low infection pressure, a pattern of slightly front-loaded stricter control (weeks 3-6) is chosen to mitigate any potential early spikes.

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic control policy for New Mexico is optimized by balancing imported infection risk across the 19 origin states and 8 upcoming weeks. Each state's traffic allocation pattern considers its infectious prevalence (I/population) and average inbound flow to New Mexico. States with high infection prevalence or large inbound flow, such as Texas and Arizona, adopt relaxed-first patterns to allow early mobility while tightening controls later to reduce cumulative imported infections and deaths. Conversely, states with lower infectious prevalence or smaller flow, such as Kentucky, Mississippi, and Alabama, tend to use strict-first or even patterns to suppress early seeding risk and then relax controls to support economic activity. This cross-state cooperation reduces peak pressure on New Mexico's health system by distributing control efforts temporally and geographically. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter control in early weeks for high-risk origin states becomes more critical to prevent exponential growth. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccination/immunity increases, more relaxed controls can be safely allowed. The strict adherence to 8-week fractions summing exactly to 1 per origin state ensures consistent total inbound flow, preserving essential mobility while strategically redistributing weekly traffic to flatten New Mexico's epidemic curve and minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths."

The imported infected cases can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)). Given the moderate infection prevalence and high inbound flow, a strict-first pattern is chosen to reduce infections early on when cumulative cases in New Mexico are still manageable. Strict control in weeks 1-4 (fractions lower than uniform 0.125) reduces immediate importation risk while relaxing controls slightly in later weeks balances mobility needs. This approach helps prevent overwhelming New Mexico's healthcare system early. The fractions sum to exactly 1.0000, validating the allocation."

  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic allocation across origin states aims to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in New Mexico by strategically distributing inbound flows over the next 8 weeks. States with high infection and exposed prevalence, such as Utah and Idaho, receive strict-first patterns to reduce early importation risk when New Mexico's healthcare system is less burdened, preventing early epidemic amplification. Conversely, massive traffic contributors like Texas and Arizona adopt relaxed-first patterns to avoid severe economic and social disruption, balancing epidemic control with mobility needs. Moderate infection prevalence states receive even or mild strict-first patterns to maintain a steady balance. This cooperative approach balances risk globally by spreading restrictions and relaxations over time and across states, preventing synchronized importation peaks that would overwhelm New Mexico. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls should be intensified, especially for high prevalence states, to avoid exponential growth. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccination improves, mobility can be relaxed more evenly.

States with high infection and exposed prevalence, such as Utah and Idaho, receive strict-first patterns to reduce early importation risk when New Mexico's healthcare system is less burdened, preventing early epidemic amplification. Conversely, massive traffic contributors like Texas and Arizona adopt relaxed-first patterns to avoid severe economic and social disruption, balancing epidemic control with mobility needs. Moderate infection prevalence states receive even or mild strict-first patterns to maintain a steady balance. This cooperative approach balances risk globally by spreading restrictions and relaxations over time and across states, preventing synchronized importation peaks that would overwhelm New Mexico. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls should be intensified, especially for high prevalence states, to avoid exponential growth. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccination improves, mobility can be relaxed more evenly. The approach systematically accounts for flow magnitudes, infection prevalence, and epidemic parameters to optimize importation risk reduction while preserving essential mobility and economic activity."
