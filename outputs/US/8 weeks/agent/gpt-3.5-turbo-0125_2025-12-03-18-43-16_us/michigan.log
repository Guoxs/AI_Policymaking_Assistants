    "notes": "Alabama shows moderate infection prevalence with I=409 in a population around 4.9 million, indicating a relatively low infection ratio. The expected imported infections are proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population). Given the moderate infection pressure and large average daily inflow (8073.64), a slight front-loading of traffic restriction is chosen to reduce early imported cases when Michigan's own infections are relatively high. The strict-first pattern with gradually relaxed control (fractions increasing slightly towards later weeks) helps balance epidemic control and mobility needs, preventing early spikes. This pattern minimizes cumulative cases in Michigan by suppressing early importation risk. The sums of fractions equal exactly 1, ensuring total flow remains constant."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Michigan, traffic control policies are designed considering both the infection prevalence in origin states and the magnitude of inbound flows. States with high infectious populations and large flows to Michigan (notably Ohio, Indiana, Tennessee, and Wisconsin) receive stricter early control, following a strict-first pattern to suppress imported infections when Michigan's own infections are still high. This reduces early epidemic seeding and subsequent spread. States with moderate or low infection prevalence and inflows receive either even or relaxed-first patterns to balance epidemic control with economic mobility, maintaining essential movement without significant risk. The total inbound flow over 8 weeks remains constant for each origin, adhering to constraints. The cooperation across states balances risk by distributing stricter controls when and where most impactful, while relaxing measures later to sustain mobility and economic recovery. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls would yield larger benefits by curbing imported infections more effectively. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, mobility can be relaxed earlier to support economic activity without compromising epidemic control. This coordinated approach minimizes imported cases and deaths in Michigan by dynamically adjusting traffic restrictions based on relative risk and inflow magnitude, ensuring public health and economic objectives are jointly optimized."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce imported infections and deaths in Michigan, we assign traffic control fractions across origin states balancing infection prevalence and inflow magnitude. States with high infection prevalence (I) and/or large inflow to Michigan (Flow) warrant front-loaded strict control (strict-first pattern), minimizing early imported infections when seeding risk is highest. The imported infected is roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing ft early in such states significantly cuts initial seeding. Conversely, states with low infection prevalence and moderate or low inflow adopt even patterns to maintain steady mobility without compromising control. This cross-state cooperation ensures that cumulative importation risk is distributed over time and origin, preventing early outbreaks in Michigan. Sensitivity analysis shows that if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases in a state, stricter early controls are even more critical to prevent surge. Conversely, lower prevalence or beta allows more relaxed patterns. Our approach respects total flow constraints (sum of fractions = 1), reallocating flow timing rather than reducing total volume, ensuring economic and social mobility while mitigating epidemic risk. Overall, this coordinated, data-informed traffic allocation strategy balances epidemic control and mobility sustainability, optimally reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Michigan."

The risk of importing infected individuals into Michigan can be approximated by the product of inbound flow, fraction allocation per week, and the infection prevalence (I/population). Given the relatively stable but non-negligible infection levels, a strict-first pattern is chosen to front-load stricter traffic controls in the first weeks, gradually relaxing to allow some mobility later. This approach minimizes early importation of infections when Michigan is vulnerable, while balancing economic and social needs by relaxing controls later.

A strict-first pattern for most states front-loads stricter controls in the initial weeks to reduce the early seeding of infections, which is critical for epidemic control in Michigan given its current infection and exposed population. This approach delays and reduces imported infections, thus minimizing downstream spread and deaths. Later weeks allow gradual relaxation to balance socio-economic mobility needs and prevent excessive disruption. For some states with lower infection pressure or different epidemic dynamics, an even or relaxed-first pattern is used to balance risks and benefits. The allocation fractions for all origin states sum exactly to 1, preserving total inbound flow. Quantitatively, this cooperation across states and weeks reduces the overall force of infection imported into Michigan, leveraging temporal distribution to smooth risk and optimize control. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, more stringent early restrictions would be needed to maintain control. Conversely, lower prevalence or transmission allows more relaxed policies. Overall, these policies represent a balanced, evidence-based approach to control importation risk, protect Michigans population, and maintain reasonable mobility."

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic allocation across all origin states is designed to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Michigan by managing imported infection risk through temporal modulation of traffic control. States with higher infection prevalence (I/population) and/or larger inflows to Michigan are assigned stricter controls (lower fractions) in the initial weeks, adopting a strict-first pattern to reduce early importation risk when Michigan's own epidemic burden is still significant. Conversely, states with lower infection levels or smaller inflow receive more even traffic allocation, maintaining consistent but controlled mobility. This cross-state coordination ensures that the total inbound imported infections are lowered during critical early weeks, limiting seeding events that could amplify Michigan's epidemic. The quantitative logic follows that expected imported infected cases scale with the product of inflow, fraction of flow allowed, and infection prevalence in the origin state. By modulating weekly fractions per state, we effectively distribute infection pressure over time, avoiding large spikes in imported infections. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence in origin states increases, stricter early controls would be even more beneficial, whereas if Michigan's internal transmission rate beta changes, the optimal timing and degree of relaxation may adjust accordingly. Overall, this cooperative temporal and spatial allocation strategy balances epidemic mitigation with mobility needs, mitigating risks while supporting economic and social functions. The precise fractions for each state sum exactly to one, ensuring consistent total inbound flow as required."

States with higher infection prevalence (I/population) and/or larger inflows to Michigan are assigned stricter controls (lower fractions) in the initial weeks, adopting a strict-first pattern to reduce early importation risk when Michigan's own epidemic burden is still significant. Conversely, states with lower infection levels or smaller inflow receive more even traffic allocation, maintaining consistent but controlled mobility. This cross-state coordination ensures that the total inbound imported infections are lowered during critical early weeks, limiting seeding events that could amplify Michigan's epidemic. The quantitative logic follows that expected imported infected cases scale with the product of inflow, fraction of flow allowed, and infection prevalence in the origin state. By modulating weekly fractions per state, we effectively distribute infection pressure over time, avoiding large spikes in imported infections. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence in origin states increases, stricter early controls would be even more beneficial, whereas if Michigan's internal transmission rate beta changes, the optimal timing and degree of relaxation may adjust accordingly. Overall, this cooperative temporal and spatial allocation strategy balances epidemic mitigation with mobility needs, mitigating risks while supporting economic and social functions. The precise fractions for each state sum exactly to one, ensuring consistent total inbound flow as required."
