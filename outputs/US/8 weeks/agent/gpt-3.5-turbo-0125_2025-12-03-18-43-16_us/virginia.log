The infection pressure (I/population) is low but non-negligible. The expected imported infected cases into Virginia from Alabama can be estimated as Flow * ft * (I / total population), so by adjusting ft, we can control weekly importation risk. Given the infection trend, we apply a relaxed-first pattern, gradually increasing flow over the weeks to balance mobility and epidemic control, starting stricter to prevent early seeding. This approach minimizes early imported cases when Virginia's own infections are still concerning. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000."

Each origin state's traffic allocation pattern (mostly relaxed-first with some strict-first in high infection pressure states like Idaho, Mississippi, Utah) reflects its current epidemic risk measured by infected (I) and exposed (E) individuals relative to its susceptible population. The imported infected cases are proportional to the product of the baseline Flow, weekly fraction ft, and infection prevalence (I/population). By limiting ft early in states with higher infection pressure (strict-first), Virginia reduces the seeding of new infections in its community. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure use relaxed-first patterns to balance epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs. The fractions balance weekly risk by gradually increasing mobility as the epidemic situation stabilizes or as Virginia's own epidemic status improves. Collectively, this cross-state temporal allocation reduces peak importation risk and cumulative epidemic burden. Sensitivity to changes in prevalence or transmission rate beta suggests that stricter early controls on states with increasing I or E would further reduce imported cases, while relaxed policies risk seeding outbreaks. The approach rigorously maintains that all fractions sum to exactly 1 per state, preserving total inbound flow while redistributing weekly traffic to optimize epidemic outcomes."

The expected imported infections can be approximated by inbound flow * fraction * (I / population), meaning that weeks with higher fractions increase imported infection risk. Given the stable infection levels, we adopt a slightly relaxed-first pattern, allowing moderate flow initially to maintain mobility but increasing restrictions in mid weeks to reduce transmission risk.

The imported infections roughly follow the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * fraction * (I/population) for each state-week, so reducing fractions in weeks with higher infection prevalence reduces overall importations. Distributing traffic restrictions temporally prevents overwhelming economic impacts while cumulatively achieving import risk reduction. Sensitivity to parameters such as transmission rate beta and prevalence means that if infection rates rise unexpectedly, stricter earlier restrictions may be warranted. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, fractions can be relaxed to support mobility. The exact sum of fractions to 1 per state ensures total inbound traffic volume remains constant, meeting the constraint of maintaining total flow while modulating weekly risk. Overall, coordinated, nuanced control reflecting inter-state epidemic heterogeneity optimally reduces Virginia's cumulative confirmed and deceased cases."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce imported infections and deaths in Virginia, inbound traffic allocations are designed to minimize early-week flow from states with higher infection prevalence, as early weeks exhibit higher epidemic risk due to larger infectious populations. The model approximates imported infections as proportional to inbound flow times the fraction of infected in the origin population. States with higher I and E values, such as Ohio, Michigan, Tennessee, and Arkansas, receive stricter early restrictions (lower fractions) to reduce immediate importation pressure, progressively relaxing in later weeks as transmission risk diminishes or immunity accumulates. Conversely, states with lower infected counts or lower flow volumes have more even or relaxed-first patterns to balance economic and social mobility needs. This temporal balancing reduces peak imported infection pressure, helping Virginia manage its epidemic burden while maintaining essential mobility. The trade-offs involve forgoing some early mobility to prevent larger outbreaks and deaths later, consistent with the SEIQRD dynamics and the reproduction number affected by beta, alpha, gamma, mu, and delta parameters. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if beta (transmission rate) increases, stricter early restrictions become more critical, while lower beta permits more even distributions. Similarly, changes in prevalence alter import risk, requiring adaptive traffic control policies. The cumulative fractions for all states sum exactly to 1, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant but temporally reallocated to optimize epidemic outcomes. Coordinated multi-state traffic control reflecting infection prevalence and flow patterns is essential for reducing Virginia's epidemic impact."

The expected imported infections scale proportionally to inbound flow multiplied by the fraction and infection prevalence, i.e., imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)). Due to a steady but non-escalating infection trend, a strict-first pattern is selected, imposing stricter control in the initial weeks (lower fractions in weeks 3-6) to curb early seeding of infections, then relaxing later as risk diminishes. This phased tightening balances epidemic control by reducing imported infections during peak infectiousness while allowing mobility recovery later. The fractions sum to exactly 1.00, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant over 8 weeks."

  "global_guidance": "Across all origin states, the traffic control policy aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia by strategically allocating inbound traffic fractions over the next 8 weeks. The key principle is to reduce importation of infections during weeks when the origin states have higher infection prevalence and potentially higher transmission risk. States with higher infection rates and exposed populations, such as Tennessee, Arkansas, Alabama, and Oklahoma, adopt a strict-first pattern, imposing stronger traffic restrictions in the initial weeks to reduce early importation and epidemic seeding. This strategy leverages the natural decline or control of infections in origin states over time, allowing relaxed controls later to restore mobility. For states with more stable or moderate infection trends, even or relaxed-first patterns are chosen to balance epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs uniformly or by relaxing early and tightening later as a precaution. The quantitative cooperation logic relies on the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/population), where Flow is the daily average inbound flow from the origin state, ft is the fraction of flow allocated in week t, I is the number of infected, and population is the total population. By adjusting ft, we redistribute the inflow to minimize cumulative imported infections during weeks with higher infection pressure. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission parameters (e.g., beta) increase, stricter early controls would become even more critical to prevent exponential spread. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or effective interventions reduce transmission, more relaxed patterns could be safely adopted. The sum of fractions for each origin state is exactly 1.000, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant over the 8 weeks while optimizing temporal distribution to minimize epidemic impact. This coordinated approach across states and weeks strategically balances public health protection with maintaining necessary mobility and economic activity."
