    "notes": "Alabama shows moderate exposed and infected values (E=1353, I=409) relative to its susceptible population, indicating a moderate risk of infection importation. Given the large inbound flow baseline (2878.8 daily), imported infected cases can be approximated by Flow*ft*(I/Population), where population is the sum of compartments. The inbound flow is distributed with a strict-first pattern, applying lower fractions in the initial weeks to reduce immediate risk while gradually relaxing later as infection pressure is expected to decrease or as Iowa's internal control improves. This balances epidemic control and mobility, reducing early imported cases while allowing economic activity to resume later. The fractions sum exactly to 1, validating the distribution."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic control policy across all origin states employs a strict-first pattern, prioritizing stringent traffic restrictions in the initial weeks to reduce early imported infections into Iowa. This approach is justified by the high potential for infection importation when infected and exposed populations are relatively large in origin states, and by Iowa's current epidemiological status with non-negligible exposed and infected individuals. The formula for expected imported infections, approximated as Flow * ft * (I / Population), guides this decision by emphasizing the importance of reducing ft in weeks where importation risk is highest. By ramping up traffic allocation in later weeks, the policy balances epidemic control with mobility needs, allowing economic activity to gradually resume as infection pressures potentially decline or as local control measures improve. This temporal balancing across weeks avoids overwhelming Iowa's healthcare system early and reduces cumulative cases and deaths. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates were to increase, stricter early control or longer durations of reduced traffic would be warranted. Conversely, if beta or prevalence decrease, the policy could relax controls earlier. Coordination across states is crucial since inflows vary greatly; large flow states with high infection rates receive more stringent early restrictions to maximize impact. The exact sum-to-one constraint for fractions ensures total inbound flow continuity, maintaining travel volumes over eight weeks but redistributing temporally for epidemic mitigation."

    "notes": "Alabama has a moderate exposed (E=1071) and infected (I=336) population relative to its large susceptible base, indicating moderate risk of transmitting infection to Iowa. The expected imported infected cases scale roughly as Flow * fraction * (I / total population). Given Alabama's high average flow to Iowa (2223.93 daily), controlling inbound flow initially is critical to reduce early seeding of cases. Hence, a strict-first pattern is chosen with lower fractions in early weeks (f1=0.05, f2=0.05) and gradual relaxation later as cases likely decline due to control. This pattern balances epidemic control and mobility by deferring most travel to later weeks when risk may be lower. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000, meeting constraints."

The imported infections scale as Flow * fraction * (I/population). To mitigate early importation, a strict-first traffic pattern is preferred, with lower fractions in the first two weeks (0.06, 0.07) progressively increasing, allowing travel when infection pressure is expected to lessen. This approach reduces early epidemic seeding while preserving overall flow. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000, fulfilling requirements."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Iowa, the traffic control strategy employs a strict-first pattern across all origin states. This approach delays the bulk of inbound travel to later weeks, reducing early seeding of infections when Iowa's susceptible population remains vulnerable and local transmission can rapidly escalate. The imported infection risk from each origin state is approximated as the product of inbound flow, fraction allocated to each week, and the infected prevalence ratio (I/population) of that state. By front-loading stricter controls (lower fractions) in early weeks, especially from states with higher infected counts or larger daily flows, the strategy effectively flattens the importation curve, reducing initial epidemic pressure in Iowa. This coordinated suppression across states leverages temporal risk balancing, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant but redistributed to minimize synchronous peaks of infection importation. The strategy respects the trade-off between epidemic control and economic mobility by gradually relaxing restrictions over the 8 weeks, enabling eventual resumption of travel without overwhelming Iowa's healthcare capacity. Sensitivity considerations indicate that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become even more critical, while if these decrease, a more even pattern could suffice. Conversely, if mobility demands intensify, the relaxation phase can be adjusted to accommodate gradual increases without compromising control. This collective approach optimizes cross-state cooperation by harmonizing flows to avoid importation spikes, ultimately minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Iowa. The weekly fractions for each origin state sum to exactly 1.000, ensuring no alteration in total inbound volume but optimizing temporal distribution to mitigate epidemic risk."

Given the very high average past 56-day inflow into Iowa (over 10 million, but for Iowa specifically 1911.64 daily), imported infections are roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population). To minimize risk, we adopt a strict-first pattern to suppress early importation risk when infected prevalence may be higher or uncertain. The fractions gradually relax from 0.15 in week 1 to around 0.12 in week 8, balancing epidemic control with mobility needs. This pattern helps flatten the imported infection curve while maintaining total flow constant (sum 1.000). Trade-offs include slightly reduced mobility early on but protecting Iowa from seeding infections. The fractions sum exactly to 1, validating compliance."

We choose an even pattern with slightly front-loaded reduction in weeks 1-2 and gradual relaxation later, reflecting moderate epidemic pressure with some uncertainty in infection trends. This allocation balances control and mobility by smoothing traffic restrictions over time instead of harsh early cuts. It mitigates abrupt economic impacts while maintaining disease control.

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic allocations to Iowa from all origin states are designed to minimize imported infections and subsequent epidemic burden by strategically modulating weekly traffic fractions while preserving total 8-week flow volumes. States with higher infection prevalence relative to their populations and/or large daily inflows to Iowa (e.g., Arkansas, Idaho, Utah, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Nebraska) receive stricter traffic control early in the 8-week horizon, following a strict-first pattern to reduce early seeding risk when infection pressure is highest. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflows adopt more even or relaxed-first patterns, balancing epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs to avoid undue disruption. This staggered approach distributes risk over time and space, preventing sharp peaks of imported infections that could overwhelm Iowa's healthcare system. Quantitatively, expected imported infected individuals from each origin state in week t scale approximately as Flow * ft * (I / Population), so reducing ft in high-risk weeks reduces infections proportionally. By ensuring the sum of fractions equals exactly 1 per origin state, total inbound traffic volume is preserved, maintaining connectivity and economic activity. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter and earlier traffic controls become more impactful in reducing epidemic spread. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or immunity rises, controls can be relaxed sooner. The adopted policy balances these factors across states and weeks, optimizing epidemic mitigation and mobility preservation for Iowa."

States with higher infection prevalence relative to their populations and/or large daily inflows to Iowa (e.g., Arkansas, Idaho, Utah, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Nebraska) receive stricter traffic control early in the 8-week horizon, following a strict-first pattern to reduce early seeding risk when infection pressure is highest. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflows adopt more even or relaxed-first patterns, balancing epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs to avoid undue disruption. This staggered approach distributes risk over time and space, preventing sharp peaks of imported infections that could overwhelm Iowa's healthcare system. Quantitatively, expected imported infected individuals from each origin state in week t scale approximately as Flow * ft * (I / Population), so reducing ft in high-risk weeks reduces infections proportionally. By ensuring the sum of fractions equals exactly 1 per origin state, total inbound traffic volume is preserved, maintaining connectivity and economic activity. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter and earlier traffic controls become more impactful in reducing epidemic spread. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or immunity rises, controls can be relaxed sooner. The adopted policy balances these factors across states and weeks, optimizing epidemic mitigation and mobility preservation for Iowa."

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy focuses on minimizing the cumulative infected and deceased cases in Iowa by strategically allocating inbound traffic fractions to origin states based on their infection prevalence and flow magnitude. States with higher infected counts and larger travel flows to Iowa are assigned strict-first patterns, imposing stronger restrictions in the initial weeks to lower early importation pressure when Iowa's susceptible population is still large and vulnerable. This front-loaded control reduces the seeding of new infections, which can exponentially increase cases and deaths. Conversely, states with moderate infection levels or lower flow volumes have milder strict-first or balanced patterns, allowing gradual relaxation to maintain economic and social mobility. The sum of fractions for each origin state is carefully normalized to exactly 1, preserving total inbound traffic but redistributing it weekly to optimize epidemic outcomes. This cooperative approach across states balances risk, reduces peak infection importation, and smoothens traffic to prevent overwhelming Iowa's health resources. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence increases or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early controls become more critical, while lower prevalence or improved local controls might allow more relaxed patterns. The policy is robust to moderate changes in parameters but emphasizes early intervention to prevent large outbreaks. This approach supports epidemic control while considering economic and mobility needs, leveraging data-driven allocation of traffic flows from multiple origins to Iowa."
