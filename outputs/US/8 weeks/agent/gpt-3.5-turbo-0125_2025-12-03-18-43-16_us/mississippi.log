Given the high average daily inflow into Mississippi (146,838.73), the imported infected cases can be approximated by Flow*ft*(I/population). The large population dilutes the infected ratio, but the absolute inflow is significant, so reducing early week flow reduces imported infections effectively. We chose a strict-first pattern, applying stricter controls in the first weeks (fractions 0.20 down to 0.07) to reduce initial seeding in Mississippi, relaxing controls as local containment improves. This balances epidemic control and mobility by allowing gradual traffic normalization. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000, validating the allocation."

The average daily inflow is relatively low (2447.14), but the infected ratio is higher than Alabama. Using the formula imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), more risk is in early weeks before cases in Mississippi reduce.

As local containment improves and the susceptible population decreases, traffic restrictions are gradually relaxed, balancing epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs. Quantitatively, the imported infection risk from each origin state is proportional to the product of inbound flow, the fraction of traffic allowed (ft), and the infection prevalence (I/S+E+I+Q+R+D) in that state. By reducing early ft values especially from states with high infected counts and large inflows (e.g., Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas), we effectively lower the cumulative imported infections and downstream deaths in Mississippi. Coordinated allocation across states ensures that no week is overloaded with high-risk inflow, flattening infection importation over time. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence were to increase or the transmission rate (beta) rises, stricter early controls would yield even greater benefits, while if prevalence falls, mobility can be relaxed sooner. This policy framework thus dynamically balances epidemiological risk and mobility, prioritizing early intervention to protect Mississippi's population while gradually restoring normal travel."

    "notes": "Alabama has a large susceptible population (4,855,423) and moderate exposed (1,071) and infected (336) cases, with a significant daily inbound flow to Mississippi (98,081.64). The risk of importing infections is proportional to the fraction of infected individuals among the population multiplied by the flow and the weekly fraction ft: imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population). Given the moderate infection prevalence, a strict-first pattern is chosen to apply stricter traffic control in the early weeks (lower fractions), gradually relaxing controls as the epidemic pressure lowers or stabilizes. This approach minimizes initial imported infections when the imported risk is higher and permits mobility recovery later. The trade-off balances epidemic control by limiting early imported cases and mobility by allowing gradual reopening. The fractions sum exactly to 1, validating the allocation."

    "notes": "Arizona shows higher exposed (2,820) and infected (843) cases relative to population, with a smaller inbound flow (1,828.21). The imported infection risk remains significant due to higher I, but the total flow is small.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies across all origin states collectively aim to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Mississippi by strategically adjusting inbound flow fractions over the next 8 weeks while maintaining the total flow constant. The strict-first pattern adopted for states with higher infected and exposed populations and higher inbound flow—such as Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, and Oklahoma—serves to sharply reduce the imported infection risk during the early weeks when prevalence and epidemic pressure are highest. This early tightening of controls reduces the seeding of infections into Mississippi, lowering the overall epidemic burden. For states with moderate or lower infection prevalence and/or lower flow, an even pattern is chosen to maintain a consistent level of mobility and control, preventing abrupt changes that might cause unnecessary economic or social disruption while still managing epidemic risk effectively. This balance across weeks and states leverages the formula imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), where the imported infection risk is proportional to the infected fraction in the origin population, the daily inbound flow, and the weekly fraction ft. By allocating stricter controls in weeks with higher infection pressure and relaxing controls when risk diminishes, the policy achieves risk balancing over time. The sensitivity of the results to parameters such as prevalence or transmission rate beta implies that if infection rates rise, stricter and more prolonged controls may be needed, whereas if prevalence falls or vaccination reduces transmission, more relaxed policies could be adopted earlier. Coordination across origin states ensures that high-risk flows are controlled more tightly initially, preventing import-driven outbreaks, while supporting mobility from lower-risk states. This strategic balancing reduces expected imported infections and deaths in Mississippi while minimizing social and economic impacts."

This approach reduces the initial seeding of infections in Mississippi, limiting exponential growth of cases and deaths. States with lower infection prevalence or lower flow are allocated more even or relaxed-first patterns, balancing epidemic control and mobility needs. The overall strategy leverages the fact that imported infections scale approximately as Flow*ft*(I/Population) for each origin state and week, so reducing ft (traffic fraction) during weeks of higher risk or higher prevalence mitigates imported case numbers. The fractions for each state sum exactly to 1, preserving total inbound flow over the 8 weeks as required. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter or extended early controls may be warranted to maintain reductions in imported infections. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or immunity increases, a more relaxed pattern could be adopted safely. The cooperative balancing across states and weeks ensures that total inbound flow remains constant but is temporally reallocated to periods of lower risk, optimizing cumulative epidemic outcomes in Mississippi while maintaining essential mobility. This nuanced approach reflects the trade-offs between epidemic control and economic/social mobility, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Mississippi through targeted temporal traffic control."

The risk of importing infected individuals is roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/S). Given the substantial daily inflow of 98187, we estimate notable infection pressure. Early weeks apply strict controls (f1=0.05, f2=0.06) to reduce initial importation while gradually relaxing later (peak at f7=0.19) as local dynamics stabilize and risk diminishes. This strict-first pattern balances epidemic control by reducing early infectious importation and allows some mobility recovery later.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies collectively implement a strict-first pattern across all origin states, prioritizing reduced inbound flows in the initial weeks (particularly weeks 1-4) when the risk of importing infected individuals is highest due to prevalent exposed and infected populations in origin states. This approach effectively lowers the cumulative number of imported infections, thus mitigating the potential for local outbreaks and deaths in Mississippi. The total flow from each origin state remains constant over the 8 weeks, preserving overall mobility demand but shifting it to later weeks when epidemic pressure is lower. This temporal redistribution balances epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs. Quantitatively, imported infections from state i at week t scale roughly as Flow_i * f_t * (I_i / S_i), and by minimizing f_t in early weeks for states with higher I_i/S_i ratios or large inflows, the policy reduces the initial seeding of infections. The cooperation across states is based on their infection prevalence and inflow magnitudes, allowing higher traffic fractions later when risk is decreased. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, more stringent early restrictions would be warranted, whereas lower prevalence could allow more relaxed early controls. Overall, the strict-first pattern with carefully calibrated fractions summing to one ensures effective epidemic mitigation with sustainable mobility."
