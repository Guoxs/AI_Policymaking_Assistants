The risk of importing infections is proportional to the inbound flow times the infected fraction, approximately imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)). Alabama's infected proportion is about 0.0000838. The traffic allocation follows a strict-first pattern, reducing inbound flow more aggressively in earlier weeks to mitigate immediate importation of infections, gradually relaxing controls later. This pattern is justified given the moderate but non-negligible infection pressure. A trade-off is maintained by not overly restricting flow in later weeks to allow some mobility recovery. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000, ensuring flow conservation."

  "global_guidance": "The overall traffic control policy across all origin states for Wisconsin is designed to minimize imported infections and deaths while preserving total inbound flow over the next 8 weeks. The strategy leverages infection prevalence data (I and E) relative to population sizes to estimate infection pressure from each origin. States with higher infection ratios, such as Arkansas, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Idaho, receive stricter traffic control earlier (strict-first patterns) to curb immediate influx of infections, reducing early epidemic growth in Wisconsin. States with lower infection prevalence or large populations with low infected ratios, such as Texas and Virginia, have more relaxed or even patterns to balance mobility and control. The policy distributes traffic flows temporally to flatten the importation risk curve, avoiding peaks that could overwhelm Wisconsin's health system. By balancing strict and relaxed patterns, the policy manages trade-offs between epidemic control and mobility needs, essential for economic and social stability. Quantitatively, imported infections scale with Flow * ft * (I / population), so adjusting ft over weeks shifts infection risk while keeping total flow constant. The sum of fractions for each state is exactly 1.000 to conserve total flow. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early control would be more critical. Conversely, if prevalence drops or vaccination increases, more relaxed patterns could be adopted to facilitate mobility. This coordinated cross-state approach ensures Wisconsin minimizes imported cases and deaths by temporally staggering traffic intensities based on origin state risk profiles and epidemic dynamics."

    "notes": "Alabama exhibits relatively low infection (I=336) compared to its large susceptible population (S=4,855,423). The exposed (E=1,071) and infected proportions are low, indicating moderate risk of imported infections. The expected imported infected cases roughly follow: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population). Given the risk is moderate and consistent, a strict-first pattern is employed to minimize early importation pressure. By imposing stricter controls initially (lower fractions) and gradually relaxing, Wisconsin can reduce imported infections while balancing mobility needs over 8 weeks. The fractions sum to exactly 1.0000, validating the allocation."

The risk of imported infections is higher, so the traffic control pattern follows a strict-first approach to reduce early importation risk. Quantitatively, imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/population). The fractions start low and increase later, allowing mobility to recover as risk potentially decreases. This balances epidemic control and mobility trade-offs. The sum of fractions is exactly 1.0000, confirming correctness."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively minimize imported infections and deaths in Wisconsin, the traffic control policies across all origin states employ a strict-first traffic allocation pattern. This approach prioritizes reducing early-week inbound flows when infection prevalence in origin states is highest, thereby lowering the initial seeding of infections into Wisconsin, which is crucial given the epidemiological parameters (beta=0.0712, alpha=0.1, gamma=0.063, mu=0.0007). The imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/population) approximation guides the control intensity for each origin state, balancing infection risk and mobility. States with higher infected proportions receive tighter early controls (smaller ft in early weeks) and gradual relaxation later, reflecting expected decreases in infection pressure and the need to restore mobility. This temporal balancing reduces cumulative exposure and deaths by preventing early amplification while sustaining economic and social activity in later weeks. Cross-state cooperation in adjusting proportions ensures that total inbound flows over 8 weeks remain constant, preventing unintended surges. Sensitivity to prevalence changes or transmission rates would require recalibration; higher prevalence or beta values would call for even stricter early controls, while lower values might allow more mobility. This adaptive, risk-based traffic allocation strategy optimally mitigates epidemic spread while respecting mobility demands."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Wisconsin, the inbound traffic allocations from all origin states are designed to reduce imported infections by adjusting weekly traffic fractions while maintaining total flow. The key logic uses the infection pressure approximated as Flow*ft*(I/Population), prioritizing stricter controls (lower fractions) during weeks of higher infection prevalence or higher relative infectiousness. States with higher infected and exposed populations, such as Texas, Arizona, Michigan, and Ohio, are assigned a relaxed-first pattern with stricter controls early and gradual relaxation to reduce early importation risk and allow mobility recovery later. Conversely, states with more stable or lower infection levels receive more even distribution or strict-first patterns to prevent early importation spikes. This cross-state cooperation balances the epidemic risk by staggering flows to avoid simultaneous importation peaks, effectively flattening the imported infection curve. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more critical, and the relaxed-first pattern's ramp-up should be slower. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, controls can be relaxed earlier. The overall approach balances epidemic control with mobility needs, ensuring economic and social functions continue while minimizing importation-driven outbreaks. The fractions are precisely calibrated to sum to one per origin state to preserve total mobility volume over 8 weeks, ensuring compliance with policy requirements."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policy collectively applies a strict-first pattern across all origin states, prioritizing early weeks for stronger restrictions to minimize imported infections into Wisconsin when infection prevalence among origin states is non-negligible. This approach leverages the quantitative logic that imported infections scale with inbound flow times the infected proportion in origin states. By reducing fractions in early weeks, the cumulative seeding of infections in Wisconsin is mitigated, lowering downstream confirmed cases and deaths. The gradual relaxation over the 8 weeks balances epidemic control with mobility needs, acknowledging economic and social factors. Cross-state coordination is essential since imported infections from multiple states aggregate to influence local epidemic dynamics; thus, spreading restrictions proportionally across states according to infection prevalence and flow ensures no single state's traffic overwhelms control efforts. The exact sum to 1.000 for each origin state maintains total traffic volume, avoiding unintended volume shifts. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmissibility beta rises, stricter early controls or longer durations of restrictions may be warranted. Conversely, if prevalence falls or vaccination improves, relaxation could be accelerated. This policy is adaptive to observed epidemic trends and maintains flexibility for adjustments.

This approach leverages the quantitative logic that imported infections scale with inbound flow times the infected proportion in origin states. By reducing fractions in early weeks, the cumulative seeding of infections in Wisconsin is mitigated, lowering downstream confirmed cases and deaths. The gradual relaxation over the 8 weeks balances epidemic control with mobility needs, acknowledging economic and social factors. Cross-state coordination is essential since imported infections from multiple states aggregate to influence local epidemic dynamics; thus, spreading restrictions proportionally across states according to infection prevalence and flow ensures no single state's traffic overwhelms control efforts. The exact sum to 1.000 for each origin state maintains total traffic volume, avoiding unintended volume shifts. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmissibility beta rises, stricter early controls or longer durations of restrictions may be warranted. Conversely, if prevalence falls or vaccination improves, relaxation could be accelerated. This policy is adaptive to observed epidemic trends and maintains flexibility for adjustments. Overall, the coordinated strict-first allocation lowers imported infection risk, thereby reducing Wisconsin's cumulative confirmed and deceased cases while balancing mobility needs."
