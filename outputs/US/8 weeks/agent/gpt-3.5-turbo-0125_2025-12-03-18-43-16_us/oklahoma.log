The exposed (E=1353) and confirmed (Q=14159) are substantial, indicating ongoing transmission. The risk of importing infected individuals is proportional to Flow*ft*(I/Population). Given moderate infection pressure, a slight front-loading of stricter control is prudent (strict-first pattern), reducing early weeks' fractions to suppress initial importation. This pattern allows gradual relaxation as local cases in Oklahoma adjust. The trade-off balances epidemic control with mobility needs, avoiding overly harsh restrictions that impact economic and social activities.

States with lower or moderate prevalence employ relaxed-first or even patterns, gradually increasing traffic to preserve economic activity while monitoring epidemic trends. The quantitative risk of imported infections is proportional to the product of inbound flow, weekly traffic fraction, and infection prevalence (I/population). By adjusting weekly fractions while keeping total 8-week flow constant, early weeks can have stricter controls to reduce immediate importations, with later weeks relaxing restrictions as local conditions improve and immunity increases. This temporal allocation balances the trade-off between controlling epidemic spread and sustaining mobility. Cross-state coordination ensures that cumulative importations are minimized by distributing stricter controls among high-risk states, preventing overwhelming local health resources. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter front-loading of controls becomes more critical; conversely, if prevalence declines, gradual relaxation is feasible. All fraction arrays sum exactly to 1.000, ensuring total inbound flow remains unchanged, preserving overall mobility while optimizing epidemic outcomes."

The infected ratio is low (~0.0069%), suggesting a moderate risk of importing infections. The imported infected cases can be approximated by Flow*ft*(I/Population). To minimize risk, we apply a relaxed-first pattern, starting with moderate restrictions and gradually easing traffic. This approach balances economic activity with epidemic control, assuming the infectious pressure does not spike. The fractions sum exactly to 1, validating the allocation."

  "global_guidance": "The allocations across origin states collectively aim to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Oklahoma by strategically adjusting traffic controls based on infection and exposure levels relative to population size. States with higher infected (I) and exposed (E) counts relative to their population, such as Texas, Michigan, Ohio, and Utah, receive stricter early-week restrictions (strict-first pattern) to reduce initial imported infection pressure. This helps suppress early epidemic seeding in Oklahoma. Conversely, states with lower infected prevalence or where economic/social ties are critical have more balanced or relaxed-first patterns to maintain mobility while controlling risk. The quantitative cooperation logic is grounded in the proportionality of imported infected cases to Flow*ft*(I/Population), where ft is the weekly fraction of inbound flow. By reducing ft in weeks where infectious pressure is highest, imported infections decrease, flattening the epidemic curve. Sensitivity analyses show that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter and more front-loaded traffic restrictions become necessary to maintain control. Conversely, if local Oklahoma immunity increases or beta decreases, traffic can be relaxed earlier or more evenly. The sum of weekly fractions for each state equals exactly 1, ensuring the total inbound flow remains constant over the 8 weeks, fulfilling the task constraint. These coordinated policies balance epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs effectively."

Given the low prevalence of infection, the risk of importing infectious individuals is moderate. The expected imported infections can be roughly estimated as Flow * ft * (I / Total Population). To minimize risk, we adopt a strict-first pattern with lower fractions in the first weeks (0.05 to 0.15) gradually increasing to relaxed control towards week 8 (0.20). This approach helps reduce early imported cases when the epidemic in Oklahoma is still active, then gradually allows more mobility as local control improves. The trade-off balances epidemic control with economic and social needs, avoiding prolonged strict restrictions. The fractions sum to exactly 1, ensuring total flow remains constant."

This strict-first pattern across most states delays and reduces imported infections during the critical period, allowing local healthcare to manage cases better and preventing early resurgence. Higher fractions are allowed in later weeks to gradually restore mobility and economic activities, balancing epidemic control and social needs. Cross-state reasoning shows that states with higher infection prevalence and/or large inflows (e.g., Texas, Arkansas, New Mexico) have the strictest early restrictions, reflecting their high risk. Conversely, states with low infected prevalence and smaller inflows have more moderate restrictions. This cooperation across states helps distribute risk temporally and spatially, preventing overwhelming importation spikes. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence rises or transmission parameters (beta) increase, stricter early controls become even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or immunity increases, controls could be relaxed earlier. Overall, this adaptive traffic control strategy balances public health imperatives with economic and social considerations, maintaining total traffic volume over 8 weeks but shifting it to reduce epidemic spread risks effectively."

  "global_guidance": "The policy collectively reduces expected imported infections and deaths in Oklahoma by strategically allocating traffic controls based on infection prevalence and inflow volumes from each origin state. States with higher infection counts and larger inflows, such as Texas, Arkansas, and Michigan, receive stricter early restrictions ('strict-first' patterns) to minimize early seeding of infections in Oklahoma, thereby flattening the epidemic curve and reducing healthcare burden. States with low infection prevalence and moderate inflow employ either even or mild strict-first patterns to maintain balance between epidemic control and economic activity. The traffic fractions sum to one per state, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant but temporally redistributed to concentrate controls when infection risk is highest. Cross-state coordination is implicit in allocating stricter controls early across high-risk states while allowing relaxation later as local and imported risks decline, thus balancing mobility and epidemic mitigation across the region. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter and longer early restrictions would be necessary. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccination improves, more relaxed and even distributions would be optimal. Overall, this approach minimizes cumulative cases and deaths through temporally optimized mobility controls, leveraging infection data and mobility baselines for informed epidemic management."

States with higher infection counts and larger inflows, such as Texas, Arkansas, and Michigan, receive stricter early restrictions ('strict-first' patterns) to minimize early seeding of infections in Oklahoma, thereby flattening the epidemic curve and reducing healthcare burden. States with low infection prevalence and moderate inflow employ either even or mild strict-first patterns to maintain balance between epidemic control and economic activity. The traffic fractions sum to one per state, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant but temporally redistributed to concentrate controls when infection risk is highest. Cross-state coordination is implicit in allocating stricter controls early across high-risk states while allowing relaxation later as local and imported risks decline, thus balancing mobility and epidemic mitigation across the region. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter and longer early restrictions would be necessary. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccination improves, more relaxed and even distributions would be optimal. Overall, this approach minimizes cumulative cases and deaths through temporally optimized mobility controls, leveraging infection data and mobility baselines for informed epidemic management."
