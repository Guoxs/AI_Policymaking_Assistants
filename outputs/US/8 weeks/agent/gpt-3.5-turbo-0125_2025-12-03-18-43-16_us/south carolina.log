  "global_guidance": "Our traffic control recommendations collectively aim to minimize imported infections and deaths in South Carolina by adjusting the weekly inbound flow fractions from each origin state while keeping total inbound flow constant. States with higher infected (I) and exposed (E) populations relative to their susceptible populations receive patterns that reduce flow in critical early weeks (strict-first) or employ relaxed-first where infection trends are expected to decline, balancing epidemic control and economic activity. The imported infection risk is roughly proportional to the product of flow, fraction, and infection prevalence (I/population), so distributing flow to weeks with lower infection prevalence reduces cumulative importation risk. The even patterns for states with low infection prevalence maintain stable mobility while controlling risk. Relaxed-first patterns are applied where early mobility is prioritized without substantially increasing risk, assuming that infection pressure will diminish. For states with high infection pressure, strict-first patterns reduce early importation risk at some mobility cost. This cross-state cooperation logic balances the overall epidemic risk by spreading inbound flow in time and across states, avoiding surges in imported infections that could overwhelm South Carolina's control capacity. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) increases, stricter early controls may be necessary to prevent importation-driven outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence declines faster than expected, flow can be relaxed earlier to boost mobility. This flexible allocation framework allows adaptive epidemic control integrated with mobility needs, minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in South Carolina."

The imported infected can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)) indicating that the infection prevalence is low (~0.0069%). To minimize risk while balancing mobility, a 'strict-first' pattern is chosen with lower fractions (stricter controls) in early weeks when South Carolina's own infections are moderately high (I=1472) and easing in later weeks as local recovery increases. This pattern reduces initial high-risk introductions while allowing economic activity later. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy balances the imported infection risk from origin states with South Carolina's internal epidemic status by modulating weekly inbound traffic fractions. States with high infection prevalence (I and E) and large inflows, such as Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, and Virginia, are assigned a 'strict-first' pattern applying lower inbound fractions early when South Carolina's internal infections are higher, reducing the risk of imported cases exacerbating local spread. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflows, such as Iowa, Nebraska, and Utah, are assigned 'relaxed-first' or even patterns to not overly restrict mobility unnecessarily. This staggered approach spreads the imported infection risk over time, avoiding large spikes and supporting healthcare capacity. The total inbound flow per origin state remains constant over 8 weeks, satisfying the constraint that fractions sum to exactly 1. The fractional values range between 0.04 and 0.20 approximately, reflecting feasible mobility policies from strict to relaxed. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission beta increases, stricter early controls become more beneficial to prevent seeding of new cases. Conversely, if local South Carolina infections drop faster, relaxing controls earlier can be safe. Cross-state coordination is crucial; the combined effect of staggered traffic control reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths more effectively than uniform policies. The approach also balances economic and social needs by gradually restoring mobility after initial strict control periods. This dynamic and data-driven allocation is essential to minimize the total epidemic burden in South Carolina while maintaining reasonable mobility."

  "global_guidance": "Across all origin states, the traffic control policy prioritizes early-stage strict inbound flow reductions (strict-first patterns) reflecting the higher risk of imported infections during initial weeks when infection prevalence is significant. This approach collectively reduces the cumulative imported infected cases, thus minimizing new confirmed and deceased cases in South Carolina. The allocation balances epidemic control and mobility needs by gradually relaxing restrictions over 8 weeks to support economic and social activities. Quantitatively, imported infections from each state scale with their inflow, infected fraction (I/population), and the weekly fraction ft. By lowering ft in early weeks for states with higher infection prevalence, the total imported infection load is reduced early on, dampening downstream transmission within South Carolina. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta were to increase, the strict-first pattern with stronger early restrictions remains optimal to prevent surges. Conversely, if prevalence drops or beta declines due to vaccination or other controls, mobility can be relaxed sooner. The allocations sum precisely to 1 per state, ensuring the total inbound flow remains constant while optimizing temporal distribution to minimize epidemic impact."

This approach collectively reduces the cumulative imported infected cases, thus minimizing new confirmed and deceased cases in South Carolina. The allocation balances epidemic control and mobility needs by gradually relaxing restrictions over 8 weeks to support economic and social activities. Quantitatively, imported infections from each state scale with their inflow, infected fraction (I/population), and the weekly fraction ft. By lowering ft in early weeks for states with higher infection prevalence, the total imported infection load is reduced early on, dampening downstream transmission within South Carolina. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta were to increase, the strict-first pattern with stronger early restrictions remains optimal to prevent surges. Conversely, if prevalence drops or beta declines due to vaccination or other controls, mobility can be relaxed sooner. The allocations sum precisely to 1 per state, ensuring the total inbound flow remains constant while optimizing temporal distribution to minimize epidemic impact.'

  "global_guidance": "The collective approach to allocate inbound traffic fractions across origin states aims to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in South Carolina by balancing epidemic control and mobility demands. States with higher infected (I) and exposed (E) populations relative to their susceptible populations are assigned stricter controls in early weeks (strict-first patterns) to limit immediate importation of infections, thereby protecting South Carolina's healthcare system from sudden surges. Conversely, states with lower or moderate infection prevalence are allowed more relaxed traffic early or a gradual increase in flow (relaxed-first or even patterns), supporting economic activity while monitoring epidemic trends. The quantitative logic behind this strategy follows imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), where controlling ft in early weeks for high-risk states reduces imported infections significantly due to the exponential nature of disease spread. The cooperation across weeks and states balances the load on South Carolina, preventing simultaneous high inflows from multiple high-risk states early on. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, the benefits of stricter early control intensify, while lower prevalence allows more flexible mobility. Conversely, if local South Carolina conditions worsen, further tightening may be warranted. This policy thus adapts dynamically to epidemiological indicators and mobility baselines, ensuring an optimized trade-off between disease control and socio-economic factors. All fractions per state sum exactly to 1, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant over 8 weeks."
