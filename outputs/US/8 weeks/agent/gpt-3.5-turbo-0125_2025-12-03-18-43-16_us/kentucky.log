The risk of importing infected individuals is proportional to the inbound flow multiplied by the infected fraction (I / total population). Given the steady but not extremely high infection prevalence, a strict-first pattern is chosen to reduce early week importation risks and protect Kentucky's vulnerable population. This means stricter controls early on (weeks 1-4) with gradually relaxed controls later (weeks 5-8). The trade-off balances epidemic control by limiting early imported infections while slowly restoring mobility. All fractions sum exactly to 1 (sum=1.000)."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Kentucky, the strategy prioritizes reducing early week importation of infections from all origin states by adopting a strict-first traffic control pattern. This approach imposes stricter inbound flow restrictions during the initial weeks (weeks 1-4) when the risk of introducing infections is highest due to the current epidemic status in origin states. Since imported infected individuals are proportional to the product of inbound flow, infected fraction, and week fraction, lowering early week fractions effectively reduces immediate seeding of new cases in Kentucky. Gradual relaxation in later weeks (weeks 5-8) balances epidemic control with mobility restoration, thus supporting economic and social needs. Cross-state coordination ensures that states with higher infected and exposed populations, such as Tennessee, South Carolina, and Arkansas, have more stringent early controls, while states with lower infection prevalence have moderate controls but maintain the strict-first pattern. Quantitatively, this balances the total flow over 8 weeks while redistributing it to minimize peak importation risk. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infectious prevalence increases or transmission rate beta rises, the strict-first pattern's benefits would be even more pronounced, as early containment is critical to prevent exponential growth. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta lowers, more relaxed patterns could be feasible but may risk resurgence without early controls. Overall, the strict-first pattern is robust to variations and prioritizes public health while allowing phased mobility recovery."

    "notes": "Alabama has a moderate number of infected (I=336) and exposed (E=1071) individuals relative to its population (~4.9 million susceptible). The infection pressure is moderate, so imported infections are roughly proportional to Flow * ft * (I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)). Since the inflow is moderately high, strict control is recommended early (weeks 1-4) to reduce initial imported infections, then gradually relaxing control to balance mobility. The chosen pattern is strict-first, reducing ft early on to lower initial disease spread risk while allowing some mobility in later weeks. Trade-offs include economic and social impacts of early restrictions but benefit epidemic control in Kentucky. The fractions sum exactly to 1.0."

  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic control policy for Kentucky aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by carefully balancing imported infection risks across origin states and weeks. States with high infected and exposed populations, notably Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee, and Michigan, are assigned strict-first patterns with lower fractions in early weeks, reducing initial imported infections when epidemic risk is highest. For states with moderate or lower infection prevalence and smaller inflows, even or relaxed-first patterns are chosen to maintain economic and social mobility while controlling epidemic spread. The total inflow per state is maintained, but redistributed to lower risk weeks according to infection pressure. This cooperative balancing ensures that the aggregate imported infection load into Kentucky is flattened over time, preventing surges that could overwhelm control efforts. The approach assumes infection import risk is roughly proportional to the product of inbound flow fraction, infected proportion in the origin state, and population size. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become more crucial to prevent explosive growth. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed policies can be safely adopted. This dynamic, adaptive allocation optimizes the trade-off between epidemic control and mobility, supporting Kentucky's public health objectives while minimizing disruption."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations for Kentucky collectively aim to minimize imported infections and deaths by strategically modulating weekly traffic fractions from each origin state. States with higher infected and exposed proportions or large inflow volumes, such as Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee, and Michigan, adopt a strict-first traffic control pattern, reducing fractions in early weeks to suppress early importation when Kentucky's own epidemic is still active. This delayed relaxation allows economic and social activities to resume progressively as local conditions improve. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflows, such as Idaho, Iowa, and Nebraska, employ even traffic distribution patterns to maintain steady control without abrupt disruptions, balancing epidemic risk and mobility needs. The logic behind these allocations is quantitative: the expected imported infections from each state in a given week approximately equals the product of that week's fraction, the daily average inflow, and the proportion of infected individuals in the origin state's population. By lowering fractions during periods of higher infection risk or synchronizing with Kentuckys epidemic dynamics, the strategy minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. Additionally, smoothing traffic control patterns avoids sharp mobility fluctuations that could cause economic or logistic strain. Sensitivity analysis shows that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early restrictions become more critical, whereas lower prevalence permits more relaxed control. This cooperative cross-state allocation balances health risks and socioeconomic considerations, ensuring the total inbound traffic over eight weeks remains constant while effectively mitigating epidemic spread into Kentucky."

  "global_guidance": "The aggregate traffic control policy across all origin states focuses on minimizing imported infections into Kentucky by strategically allocating inbound flow fractions over the next 8 weeks. States with higher infected prevalence and/or large inflow (e.g., Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee) are assigned strict-first patterns, front-loading traffic restrictions in the initial weeks to suppress early imported infections which could seed local outbreaks. This approach helps reduce the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Kentucky by preventing early epidemic amplification. States with very high infected prevalence but small inflows (e.g., Idaho, Utah, New Mexico) adopt relaxed-first patterns, allowing some early mobility to reduce economic disruption while tightening controls later to manage long-term risk. Moderate risk states follow either even or slightly strict-first patterns balancing epidemic control and economic mobility. The overall sum of fractions per origin state equals exactly 1.000, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant over the 8 weeks, consistent with ground truth. This coordinated approach leverages quantitative cooperation logic: by distributing stricter controls across states and weeks according to infection pressure and inflow, the policy avoids overwhelming restrictions in any single period or state, thus mitigating economic impact while effectively reducing imported infection risk. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter or more front-loaded controls would be warranted to maintain control. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccination/immunity rises, traffic restrictions could be relaxed sooner. This dynamic allocation strategy provides a robust, adaptive framework to balance epidemic control with mobility across state borders, optimizing Kentucky's epidemic trajectory."

States with higher infected prevalence and/or large inflow (e.g., Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee) are assigned strict-first patterns, front-loading traffic restrictions in the initial weeks to suppress early imported infections which could seed local outbreaks. This approach helps reduce the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Kentucky by preventing early epidemic amplification. States with very high infected prevalence but small inflows (e.g., Idaho, Utah, New Mexico) adopt relaxed-first patterns, allowing some early mobility to reduce economic disruption while tightening controls later to manage long-term risk. Moderate risk states follow either even or slightly strict-first patterns balancing epidemic control and economic mobility. The overall sum of fractions per origin state equals exactly 1.000, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant over the 8 weeks, consistent with ground truth. This coordinated approach leverages quantitative cooperation logic: by distributing stricter controls across states and weeks according to infection pressure and inflow, the policy avoids overwhelming restrictions in any single period or state, thus mitigating economic impact while effectively reducing imported infection risk. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter or more front-loaded controls would be warranted to maintain control. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccination/immunity rises, traffic restrictions could be relaxed sooner. This dynamic allocation strategy provides a robust, adaptive framework to balance epidemic control with mobility across state borders, optimizing Kentucky's epidemic trajectory."
