The risk of imported infections can be approximated by the formula: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / (S + E + I + Q + R + D)). Given the significant inflow into Tennessee (146,294 daily), a strict-first pattern is chosen to reduce early-week exposure and allow Tennessee's local control measures to adapt. The fractions start lower to impose stricter controls initially, gradually relaxing as the weeks progress. This balances epidemic control by minimizing immediate risk while sustaining mobility over time. The sum of fractions equals exactly 1.0000, ensuring flow conservation."

  "global_guidance": "The collective strategy for Tennessee's inbound traffic control across all origin states is designed to minimize imported infections and subsequent deaths by leveraging detailed SEIQRD data and daily inflow volumes. States with high infected populations and/or large inflow volumes (e.g., Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, South Carolina, Virginia) are assigned a strict-first control pattern with reduced traffic fractions in the initial weeks, progressively relaxing controls. This front-loaded restriction reduces early seeding of new infections in Tennessee, allowing local epidemic control measures to stabilize case counts. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflows adopt an even distribution pattern, maintaining consistent traffic and economic activity without undue risk. The quantitative logic approximates imported infections as proportional to Flow * fraction * (I / population), allowing targeted reductions where risk is highest. Weekly allocations are smoothed to avoid abrupt changes, balancing epidemic suppression with mobility needs. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence rises or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter and more front-loaded controls become more critical, emphasizing early-week traffic reductions. Conversely, lower prevalence or transmission relaxes the need for strict controls, enabling more even traffic distribution. The exact sums of fractions to 1.0000 per state ensure that total inbound flow volumes remain constant, preserving overall mobility while optimizing temporal distribution for epidemic control. This multi-state cooperative approach reduces Tennessee's cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by effectively managing imported infection pressure over the next 8 weeks."

Given the average daily inflow to Tennessee, imported infections can be estimated as Flow*ft*(I/population), which is relatively low but not negligible. The allocations follow a slight strict-first pattern with tighter control in later weeks to preempt any possible spike, balancing mobility needs early on. This pattern allows some movement initially when infection pressure is lower, gradually reducing it as the weeks progress. This trade-off supports economic and social activity while aiming to minimize imported infections and deaths. The fractions sum exactly to 1."

States with higher infection rates or large inflow volumes, such as Ohio, Texas, Mississippi, and Kentucky, have stricter control patterns especially in later weeks to reduce cumulative exposure. Lower risk states or those with smaller inflows have more even or relaxed-first patterns to maintain mobility while managing risk. Quantitatively, the imported infections are approximately proportional to the product of inflow, weekly fraction, and infection prevalence (I/population) in the origin state. By allocating fractions to reduce flow during peak infection risk periods, the policy lowers the expected imported infectious individuals, thus decreasing secondary transmission in Tennessee. This cross-state cooperation effectively balances economic mobility needs with epidemic control, distributing risk temporally and spatially. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter and earlier controls would be necessary, shifting allocations further toward strict-first patterns. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccines improve, more relaxed and even allocations could be adopted. The precise fraction sums to 1 for each origin state ensure conservation of total inbound flow, making these policies feasible and consistent with ground truth traffic volumes."

The expected imported infections can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / Population), indicating that the risk of imported infection scales with traffic volume and current infectious prevalence. Given consistent infection pressure, a strict-first pattern is chosen, imposing stronger control in earlier weeks (lower fractions) to reduce initial seeding and allowing gradual relaxation later to balance mobility. This approach aims to prevent early spikes while maintaining economic and social activity later. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000, validating the distribution."

  "global_guidance": "These traffic allocation policies collectively aim to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Tennessee by strategically balancing epidemic control with mobility needs across all origin states and weeks. The key principle is to reduce imported infections by adjusting weekly traffic proportions according to infection prevalence (I), exposed count (E), and inflow volume from each origin state. States with high infected prevalence and large inflows (e.g., Kentucky, Alabama, Arkansas, Texas) adopt strict-first patterns with stronger early controls to suppress initial seeding risk, tapering restrictions later to maintain economic activity. Conversely, states with low prevalence or low inflow (e.g., Idaho, Nebraska) use relaxed-first patterns allowing more traffic early, balancing risk and mobility. Even patterns are assigned to states with moderate prevalence and inflow to maintain consistent control. The quantitative cooperation logic relies on the proportionality of imported infections to Flow*ft*(I/Population), ensuring total flow remains constant while redistributing traffic to minimize high-risk periods. This temporal balancing reduces peak burdens on healthcare and limits cumulative cases. Sensitivity analysis shows that increases in prevalence or transmission rate (beta) would necessitate stricter early controls and possibly longer durations of reduced flow to maintain efficacy. Conversely, lower prevalence or beta could allow more relaxed patterns.

The key principle is to reduce imported infections by adjusting weekly traffic proportions according to infection prevalence (I), exposed count (E), and inflow volume from each origin state. States with high infected prevalence and large inflows (e.g., Kentucky, Alabama, Arkansas, Texas) adopt strict-first patterns with stronger early controls to suppress initial seeding risk, tapering restrictions later to maintain economic activity. Conversely, states with low prevalence or low inflow (e.g., Idaho, Nebraska) use relaxed-first patterns allowing more traffic early, balancing risk and mobility. Even patterns are assigned to states with moderate prevalence and inflow to maintain consistent control. The quantitative cooperation logic relies on the proportionality of imported infections to Flow*ft*(I/Population), ensuring total flow remains constant while redistributing traffic to minimize high-risk periods. This temporal balancing reduces peak burdens on healthcare and limits cumulative cases. Sensitivity analysis shows that increases in prevalence or transmission rate (beta) would necessitate stricter early controls and possibly longer durations of reduced flow to maintain efficacy. Conversely, lower prevalence or beta could allow more relaxed patterns. Overall, this coordinated traffic control across origin states and weeks optimizes epidemic suppression in Tennessee while preserving essential mobility and socio-economic functions, validated by exact fraction sums of 1.000 per state ensuring total inbound flow conservation.'

    "notes": "Alabama's past 56-day data shows a relatively low infection prevalence (I=852) compared to its large susceptible population (S=4,790,426). The estimated imported infected cases into Tennessee can be approximated by Flow*ft*(I/population), where Flow is the daily inbound flow and ft the weekly fraction. Given the high average daily inflow (92,152), controlling early weeks more strictly (strict-first pattern) reduces initial imported infections when Tennessee's epidemic status is sensitive. The fractions reduce gradually from 0.15 in the first two weeks to 0.11 in later weeks, balancing mobility and control. This approach minimizes the initial seeding risk while allowing some relaxation later as Tennessee's local controls strengthen and imported cases decrease. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

The daily average inflow is lower (6,509) compared to Alabama, so the imported infection risk is moderate. A relaxed-first pattern is chosen here, increasing flow in weeks 3 and 4 (0.13 each) when Tennessee's local epidemic control is expected to improve, with slightly stricter control in the first two weeks to reduce immediate risk. The fractions sum to 1.000, maintaining total inflow constant. This balances Arizona's mobility needs with Tennessees epidemic control by avoiding large importation spikes early on."

With a substantial average daily inflow of 35,063 to Tennessee, managing early importation is critical. A strict-first pattern is applied, allocating higher fractions (0.16, 0.15) in the initial weeks to quickly reduce imported infections, lowering fractions in later weeks to 0.11. The strategy is to suppress early seeding events while allowing some mobility recovery later. The sum is exactly 1.000.

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocation prioritizes reducing early importation of infections into Tennessee, especially from states with high infected counts or large inflows. The strict-first pattern is applied to states with high flow and/or high infection prevalence (e.g., Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Virginia) to minimize the seeding risk in the early weeks when Tennessee's epidemic is more vulnerable. Relaxed-first or even patterns are used for states with moderate or low infection prevalence and flow to balance mobility needs and disease control. Quantitatively, imported infections approximate Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing ft in the initial weeks for high-risk states proportionally reduces imported cases, lowering cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Tennessee. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become more critical, whereas lower prevalence allows more even or relaxed patterns. This coordinated timing of restrictions across origin states smooths mobility constraints while maintaining epidemic control, addressing trade-offs effectively. The exact summation of fractions to 1 for all states ensures no net change in total inbound volume, preserving the overall mobility baseline while strategically shifting weekly proportions to minimize epidemic impact."
