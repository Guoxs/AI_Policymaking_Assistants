  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy for Arkansas is to apply a strict-first traffic control pattern for all origin states. This means allocating lower fractions of inbound flow in the earlier weeks (weeks 1-3) when the risk of importing infections is higher due to prevalent infected and exposed individuals in origin states. As weeks progress, the fractions gradually increase to allow for mobility recovery while assuming the local and origin epidemic situations improve due to containment measures. This approach leverages the quantitative logic that the expected number of imported infections is proportional to the product of inbound flow fraction, infected proportion in the origin state, and the baseline flow. By frontloading restrictions, Arkansas reduces the initial seeding of infections, minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. The trade-off is a temporary reduction in mobility and economic activity, but the gradual relaxation balances this concern. Coordinated across states, this pattern accounts for heterogeneity in prevalence and flow volumes; states with higher infection pressure and/or flow receive more stringent early restrictions. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence increases or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early controls become even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, the strict-first pattern still ensures low risk while maintaining some mobility early on. This harmonized allocation minimizes the aggregate epidemic burden in Arkansas while respecting mobility demands and ensures all fraction vectors sum to exactly one for each origin state, maintaining flow consistency over the 8 weeks."

The expected imported infections roughly scale with Flow * ft * (I/population), so concentrating lower fractions early (stricter controls) reduces early importation risk. Given the moderate infection levels and large flow (daily inflow ~14,796), a strict-first pattern is employed, with stricter controls in weeks 1-3 to contain imported infections immediately, relaxing gradually as risk diminishes. This balances epidemic control with mobility, ensuring economic activity recovers later. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000."

This approach balances health risks and mobility needs. Fractions sum to 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "The traffic control strategy for Arkansas prioritizes minimizing early importation of infections from all origin states by applying a strict-first traffic control pattern. This approach reduces the proportion of inbound traffic in the initial weeks when infection pressure is highest, lowering the effective imported infected individuals, which is approximated as Flow * ft * (I/population). By staging stricter controls early and gradually relaxing controls in later weeks, this plan balances epidemic control and economic mobility. Cross-state coordination is critical because states with high infected counts and large daily inflows (e.g., Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi) pose the greatest risk of seeding Arkansas' epidemic. By reducing early week traffic from these high-risk states more aggressively, the plan mitigates cumulative case growth and deaths in Arkansas. States with lower infection prevalence or smaller flows receive relatively less strict reductions but still follow the same pattern to maintain consistency and reduce risk. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls become even more critical to prevent exponential growth. Conversely, if prevalence declines, the plan allows for faster relaxation. The sum of fractions for each state equals exactly 1 to ensure total inbound flow remains constant over the 8-week horizon, satisfying constraints. Overall, this cooperative and dynamic allocation of inbound traffic fractions minimizes imported infections and deaths in Arkansas while balancing mobility needs."

Its average daily inflow to Arkansas is moderate (7125). The imported infected cases roughly scale as Flow * f_t * (I / Population), which is low but non-negligible. Given the fairly stable and low infection prevalence, we adopt a strict-first pattern, imposing stricter control in the early weeks (lower fractions in weeks 1-2) to reduce initial imported infections, then gradually relaxing as Arkansas's own control improves and imported risk lowers. This approach balances epidemic control and mobility by front-loading restrictions but allowing recovery of mobility later. The fractions sum to exactly 1.0000."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Arkansas, the inbound traffic control policy prioritizes stricter restrictions in the initial weeks for all origin states, especially those with higher infection prevalence or large inflows, following a strict-first pattern. This approach reduces early imported infections, which are critical seeds for local outbreaks. The logic uses the expected imported infections approximated as Flow * fraction_week * (I / population), so by reducing fractions in early weeks, the seeding pressure is minimized. The large inflows from states like Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Alabama are especially controlled early to mitigate high-volume risks. For states with lower prevalence or inflow, moderately relaxed early weeks are allowed but still follow the strict-first pattern to ensure consistency. Over time, as local epidemic control in Arkansas improves and infection prevalence potentially declines, the fractions gradually increase to restore mobility, balancing socio-economic needs. The fraction arrays for each origin state sum exactly to 1, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant over 8 weeks. Cross-state coordination ensures that risk is balanced temporally and geographically, preventing simultaneous peaks in imported infections. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early controls yield greater benefits, while if prevalence falls, mobility can be relaxed sooner. Overall, this policy minimizes imported infections early to reduce local spread and deaths, while restoring travel over time to support economic activity."

The expected imported infections can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population), where population is roughly the sum of compartments. Given a modest infection pressure, a relaxed-first pattern is chosen to gradually ease restrictions, balancing mobility needs and epidemic control. Early weeks have stricter controls (lower fractions) to curb initial importation, then gradually relax to facilitate economic and social movement. This pattern helps smooth importation risk over time, acknowledging that abrupt relaxation could spike cases. The sum of fractions is exactly 1, validating the allocation."

  "global_guidance": "The traffic control policy for inbound flows into Arkansas is designed to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically modulating weekly traffic fractions from each origin state based on their epidemic risk profiles and the total expected inbound flow. Each state's infection pressure is interpreted via the ratio of infected (I) to total population, combined with known exposed (E) and confirmed (Q) cases to assess transmission risk. The expected imported infections approximately scale as the product of daily flow, weekly fraction, and prevalence (I/population). States with higher infection prevalence and large inflows, such as Oklahoma and Texas, receive stricter early controls (lower fractions in early weeks) to suppress initial importation risk, gradually relaxing as the epidemic trend improves or to balance socio-economic trade-offs. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or smaller inflows adopt more even or relaxed-first patterns to allow mobility with manageable risk. The weekly fractions always sum to 1 per state, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant while redistributing risk temporally. This coordinated policy distributes epidemic risk across weeks and states, preventing overwhelming spikes in Arkansas' cases by smoothing importation pressures. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls become more beneficial, whereas lower prevalence allows more relaxed allocations. Similarly, if mobility baselines fluctuate, adjusting fractions dynamically can optimize outcomes further.

Each state's infection pressure is interpreted via the ratio of infected (I) to total population, combined with known exposed (E) and confirmed (Q) cases to assess transmission risk. The expected imported infections approximately scale as the product of daily flow, weekly fraction, and prevalence (I/population). States with higher infection prevalence and large inflows, such as Oklahoma and Texas, receive stricter early controls (lower fractions in early weeks) to suppress initial importation risk, gradually relaxing as the epidemic trend improves or to balance socio-economic trade-offs. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or smaller inflows adopt more even or relaxed-first patterns to allow mobility with manageable risk. The weekly fractions always sum to 1 per state, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant while redistributing risk temporally. This coordinated policy distributes epidemic risk across weeks and states, preventing overwhelming spikes in Arkansas' cases by smoothing importation pressures. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls become more beneficial, whereas lower prevalence allows more relaxed allocations. Similarly, if mobility baselines fluctuate, adjusting fractions dynamically can optimize outcomes further. Overall, this balance of epidemic control and economic mobility aims to reduce Arkansas' disease burden effectively while sustaining necessary travel and commerce."
