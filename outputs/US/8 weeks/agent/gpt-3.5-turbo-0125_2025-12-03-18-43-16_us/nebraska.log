The risk of importing infected individuals is proportional to the inbound flow times the infected fraction (imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/S+E+I+Q+R+D)). Given Alabama's steady infection numbers, a relaxed-first pattern is chosen to allow more flow initially, tapering into stricter control mid-period, then relaxing again towards the end.

The key principle is that the expected imported infections from an origin state are proportional to the product of the inbound flow, the traffic fraction for that week, and the infected proportion in the origin state (imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population)). By modulating weekly fractions, we can strategically reduce traffic during weeks of higher infection pressure while relaxing controls when risk decreases or mobility demands increase. Across states, a consistent relaxed-first pattern is employed, where early weeks have moderately lower restrictions, mid-weeks implement stricter traffic controls to curb transmission risk, and later weeks gradually relax flows again. This pattern is justified by typical epidemic curves where initial imported infections can spark local spread, thus early caution is balanced with sustained mobility. The sum of fractions for each origin state is exactly 1, preserving total inbound flow and respecting baseline mobility constraints. The collaboration across states balances risk by shifting flows temporally, preventing simultaneous peak importations. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter controls in mid-weeks become more critical to prevent surge in cases. Conversely, if prevalence drops, mobility can be relaxed earlier. This policy respects the trade-off between epidemic control and economic/social mobility by not imposing prolonged strict restrictions but timing them to maximize infection reduction. Overall, these allocations aim to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Nebraska by controlling imported infection pressure dynamically and cooperatively across origin states and weeks."

The infected ratio is approximately 336/4855423, which is low, indicating moderate infection pressure. The incoming flow average is 740.43, so the expected imported infected individuals roughly scale as Flow*ft*(I/S). To minimize risk, a strict-first pattern is applied, allocating lower fractions in early weeks to curb initial importation of infections and gradually relaxing controls as the local epidemic stabilizes. The trade-off balances economic mobility by allowing some flow early on but with caution. The fractions sum exactly to 1, validating the distribution."

Even patterns apply where infection pressure is stable, avoiding sharp traffic fluctuations that could destabilize epidemic control. The quantitative cooperation logic balances risk by adjusting weekly fractions so that total flow remains constant per origin state, preserving economic relations while optimizing temporal distribution of risk. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early traffic control becomes more crucial to prevent exponential growth in imported infections. Conversely, if local Nebraska control improves (lower delta), traffic can be relaxed earlier. This coordinated, adaptive approach optimizes the trade-off between epidemic control and mobility across states and weeks, ensuring importation risk is minimized while maintaining feasible economic activity.

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce imported infections and deaths in Nebraska, inbound traffic allocations across origin states balance early strict controls with gradual relaxation, reflecting each state's infection pressure and mobility volumes. States with higher infected and exposed counts, such as Texas, Michigan, and Indiana, receive stricter early-week controls to curb seeding events, mitigating early surge risks in Nebraska. Conversely, states with lower prevalence, such as Kentucky and Virginia, are assigned more relaxed early-week fractions to sustain economic activity while monitoring infection trends. This cross-state coordinated approach distributes traffic loads to avoid overwhelming Nebraska's healthcare system and reduces cumulative epidemic burden. Quantitatively, imported infections roughly scale with Flow*ft*(I/population) per origin state per week; thus, adjusting ft redistributes infection pressure temporally. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become more critical to prevent widespread secondary cases. Conversely, if prevalence or beta decreases, more relaxed patterns may suffice. Overall, this policy optimizes epidemic control and mobility by mitigating importation risk spikes early, preventing cascading transmissions, while permitting increased flow later as risks diminish or health system capacity improves. The fractions for each state sum exactly to 1 to maintain total flow consistency and ensure feasibility of implementation."
