    "notes": "Alabama shows a relatively low number of infectious individuals (I=409) compared to its large susceptible population (S=4877052). The risk of importing infections is proportional to the inbound flow multiplied by the fraction of infectious individuals, thus estimated as imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population). Given low I prevalence, a moderately strict-first pattern is chosen to reduce early importation risk while allowing some mobility later. Early weeks have lower fractions to limit inflow when local Utah infections are still significant. The trade-off balances controlling initial spikes in Utah with economic and social needs of mobility. Over 8 weeks, fractions sum to exactly 1, ensuring total flow remains constant but reshaped for epidemic control."

The expected imported infections depend on the inbound flow and infection proportion, imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population). Since Arizona's daily flow to Utah is large (23848), even small infection proportions can raise risk. A strict-first pattern is adopted to mitigate early importation when Utah cases remain high.

  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic control policy for Utah's inbound flows applies a strict-first pattern across all origin states, reducing traffic fractions in the early weeks and gradually relaxing them later. This approach minimizes early importation of infectious individuals, lowering cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Utah by mitigating seeding of new infections during high local prevalence. The policy respects the constraint of constant total inbound flow over 8 weeks by redistributing traffic temporally rather than reducing volume. This temporal allocation reduces epidemic growth pressure in Utah's critical early weeks when local infections are still significant. The balancing of early strictness and later relaxation supports economic and social mobility needs while prioritizing public health. Quantitatively, imported infections from each state are proportional to their inbound flow times the fraction for that week times the proportion infectious in the origin state. By imposing lower fractions initially for states with higher infectious prevalence or larger flows, the policy harnesses cooperative regional epidemic control, mitigating cross-state transmission risks. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early reductions gain importance to prevent importation-driven outbreaks; conversely, if prevalence decreases, mobility can be relaxed earlier. This adaptive, cooperative traffic management reduces Utah's epidemic burden effectively while maintaining mobility and economic activity across the states."

The expected imported infections roughly scale with Flow * ft * (I / total population), and since Flow is moderate, early weeks have reduced traffic to minimize sudden spikes.

  "global_guidance": "This inbound traffic control policy for Utah strategically balances epidemic control and mobility by adjusting weekly traffic fractions from multiple origin states based on their infection prevalence (I and E) and flow volume. States with higher infected and exposed populations and large inflows, such as Idaho, Arizona, and Texas, receive strict-first traffic restrictions early on to reduce initial imported infections, following the principle that imported infections scale approximately as Flow * ft * (I / population). This front-loaded strictness reduces early seeding risk, allowing local resources in Utah to better manage cases and reduce further transmission. States with lower prevalence or inflow, like Mississippi and Kentucky, adopt relaxed-first or even patterns to maintain economic and social activities while keeping infection import risk manageable. The even patterns in moderate-risk states stabilize flow and reduce sudden spikes that could overwhelm contact tracing or healthcare capacity. Collectively, this distribution minimizes the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by front-loading restrictions where risk is highest and gradually relaxing controls as the epidemic stabilizes or local control improves. Sensitivity analysis indicates if prevalence in an origin state increases, stricter early controls would become more critical to prevent spikes. Conversely, if transmission rate beta decreases, some relaxation could be considered earlier. The policy sums weekly fractions to exactly 1 for each origin state, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant while redistributing risk across time. This cooperative, multi-state approach optimizes public health outcomes with minimal disruption."

Alabama's infection levels have been relatively stable, so a strict-first pattern with a gradual relaxation is suitable, to prevent early importation of cases. This policy balances epidemic control by minimizing initial imported infections while allowing some relaxation in later weeks to maintain mobility.

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the states' inbound traffic allocations prioritize reducing early-week flows from states with higher infection and exposure rates to Utah. This approach minimizes the initial seeding of infections, which is critical to preventing exponential growth. The strategy uses strict-first patterns predominantly, with front-loaded restrictions to reduce imported infections during the most vulnerable periods. Gradual relaxation in later weeks balances the need to restore economic and social mobility while maintaining control over cumulative case numbers. The risk formula approximated as imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population) guides the proportional reduction of flows in early weeks for higher-risk states. States with higher inflow volumes and higher infection prevalence (e.g., Arizona, Idaho, Texas) receive stricter early-week reductions and more gradual relaxation, reflecting their greater potential impact on Utah's epidemic. States with lower infection pressure or inflow use more balanced or even distribution patterns to maintain mobility without significantly increasing risk. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter front-loading of controls would be necessary to prevent surges in cases. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, the relaxation can be accelerated. The coordinated approach across states balances imported infection risk and mobility demands, collectively minimizing Utah's cumulative confirmed and deceased cases over the next 8 weeks.

Given the relatively low infection prevalence, the imported infection risk is moderate, expressed as imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population). The flow from Alabama to Utah is low (1296 daily average), so strict control can be partially relaxed over time. We choose a strict-first pattern, imposing stricter controls in early weeks (f1=0.15, f2=0.14) to reduce immediate imported infections, then gradually relaxing. This allows balancing epidemic control with mobility demands, limiting early infection seeding while allowing some economic activity later.

The daily inflow to Utah is substantial (29,856). Given the higher infection pressure, imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/pop). A strict-first control pattern is adopted, with lower fractions (0.10) in the first four weeks to curb early transmission risk, then gradually relaxing to accommodate traffic needs as infection pressure may decrease.

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic control strategy across all origin states prioritizes minimizing imported infections and consequent deaths in Utah by strategically adjusting weekly traffic fractions to flatten the infection pressure curve. Early weeks are generally assigned stricter controls (lower fractions) especially for states with higher infection and exposed proportions, reducing immediate risk of seeding new cases in Utah. Later weeks allow gradual relaxation to accommodate economic and social mobility needs, balancing epidemic control with human activity demands. The approach leverages quantitative cooperation logic where states with higher infection prevalence or larger inflows bear stricter early constraints, while those with lower risk maintain more even or relaxed patterns, collectively reducing the aggregate imported infection risk. Sensitivity considerations suggest that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter front-loading of controls would be needed; conversely, if prevalence falls or immunity rises, more uniform or relaxed patterns may be justified. This adaptable, data-driven traffic allocation reduces peak imported infections, flattens the local epidemic curve in Utah, and mitigates cumulative deaths, supporting a sustainable balance between public health and mobility."
