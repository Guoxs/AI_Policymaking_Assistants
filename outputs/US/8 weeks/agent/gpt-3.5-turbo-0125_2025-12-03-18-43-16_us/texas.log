  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocation collectively aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Texas by strategically modulating weekly traffic fractions from each origin state. States with higher infection prevalence (I and E) relative to their population receive stricter control in the initial weeks (lower fractions) to reduce immediate importation risk, while states with lower infection pressure or more stable epidemics have more even or gradually relaxed patterns. This staggered approach balances epidemic control and mobility by smoothing the inflow over time and preventing sudden surges in imported infections that could accelerate local transmission. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections approximate to the sum over origin states and weeks of Flow_i * ft_i_t * (I_i / Population_i), so reducing ft in weeks of high infection pressure or from high-prevalence states lowers overall importation. Furthermore, the cooperation logic across states ensures that total inbound flow remains constant for each origin state, preserving economic connectivity while flattening the importation risk curve across the 8 weeks. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls would be warranted, especially from states with rising infection trends. Conversely, if prevalence declines, more relaxed patterns could be safely adopted. The even, strict-first, or relaxed-first patterns are chosen based on infection pressure trends per state to optimize trade-offs. This comprehensive strategy leverages temporal and spatial heterogeneity to reduce epidemic burden in Texas without unduly restricting essential mobility."

Imported infected cases roughly scale as Flow * ft * (I / population), so reducing traffic in earlier weeks when cumulative infections in Texas are still high helps reduce importation risk. We apply a slightly strict-first pattern to reduce early inflow, then gradually relax control as the local epidemic stabilizes. This balances epidemic control with mobility demands, ensuring the total fraction sums exactly to 1. This approach mitigates importation risk while allowing reasonable mobility over time."

The imported infected risk can be approximated as imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population). Given the large inbound flow (32,789 daily), strict early control is recommended to reduce immediate risk. Thus, a strict-first pattern is chosen, allocating lower fractions in early weeks to limit imported infections when prevalence is higher. This reduces early infection seeding in Texas. Later weeks have slightly relaxed controls as the risk may diminish. The trade-off balances mobility needs with epidemic control, prioritizing health outcomes early.

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy prioritizes reducing imported infections into Texas by modulating weekly inbound flows from each origin state while maintaining the total inbound volume constant over the 8-week horizon. States with higher infected and exposed prevalence, especially combined with large inflow volumes (e.g., Arkansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico), are subject to stricter early-week controls (strict-first pattern) to minimize early seeding of infections in Texas. This front-loading of restrictions slows initial importation, allowing Texas' own epidemic control measures to be more effective. Conversely, states with lower infected prevalence or smaller inflows are allowed relatively more relaxed early-week traffic (relaxed-first or even patterns) to balance economic activity with epidemic risk. This staggered approach recognizes the temporal dynamics of infection risk and the capacity for epidemic control in Texas. Quantitatively, the imported infected cases are proportional to Flow*ft*(I/state_population), so reducing early ft fractions for high-risk states significantly decreases early imported infection pressure. Balancing fractions across weeks ensures total flow remains constant, preserving essential mobility and economic functions. Cross-state coordination is implicit in allocating restrictions where they yield maximum risk reduction, spreading control efforts efficiently. Sensitivity analysis suggests if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early control fractions should be further reduced to avoid overwhelming local healthcare. Conversely, if prevalence declines, the model supports gradual relaxation. The approach is robust to moderate parameter shifts due to its balanced and adaptive distribution of control intensities across states and time. This policy maximizes epidemic control benefits while respecting mobility constraints."

The expected imported infected cases are proportional to Flow * ft * (I / total population), where the population total is estimated as S+E+I+Q+R+D. Given the moderate infection pressure and significant inflow, we choose a strict-first pattern, applying stricter controls (lower fractions) in the early weeks to curb early importation and gradually relaxing controls later as risk diminishes or as local control improves.

    "notes": "Wisconsin has high infected (I=9330) and exposed (E=11735) populations. Expected imported infections scale with Flow * ft * (I / population). A strict-first pattern is adopted to reduce early importation risk, with gradual relaxation later to balance epidemic control and mobility. Fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively minimize imported infections and consequent confirmed and deceased cases in Texas, we allocate inbound traffic over the next 8 weeks using patterns sensitive to each origin state's infection pressure. The key rationale is that imported infected individuals scale approximately as Flow * ft * (I / population), where ft is the weekly fraction controlling inflow. States with higher infected and exposed proportions (e.g., Idaho, Utah, Michigan) receive stricter early controls (lower ft in early weeks) to suppress initial seeding risk. States with lower or moderate infection pressures (e.g., Kentucky, Virginia) have more even or relaxed-first patterns to balance epidemic control and mobility. By distributing restrictions temporally, we reduce peak importation risk and smooth the burden on Texas' healthcare system. This temporal balancing also preserves economic activity by relaxing controls progressively or in later weeks. Cross-state coordination is implicit: we do not reduce total inbound flow but shift weekly fractions to prevent synchronized infection surges from multiple origins. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls (lower ft early weeks) become more critical to avoid exponential case growth. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed patterns could be safely adopted. This policy dynamically balances risks and mobility, minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Texas while maintaining economic and social connectivity."
