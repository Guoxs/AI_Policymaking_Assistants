  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic control policies are designed to minimize imported infections and resultant cases and deaths in Minnesota by leveraging the infection prevalence and baseline inflow of each origin state. States with higher infected counts and higher infection prevalence, such as Arkansas, Idaho, Michigan, South Carolina, and Wisconsin, adopt stricter controls in the initial weeks (strict-first pattern) to reduce early seeding of infections when Minnesota's local infected population is still significant. This early suppression reduces the epidemic growth potential. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or very large inflow volumes but lower infected counts, such as Iowa and Utah, adopt relaxed-first or even patterns to allow economic mobility while managing risk through temporal distribution of flows. The even distribution patterns chosen for some states maintain consistent control without sudden spikes in imported cases. The traffic fractions sum exactly to 1 for each state, maintaining total inbound flow while redistributing weekly proportions to optimize disease control. Sensitivity analysis shows that increasing beta or infected prevalence in origin states would suggest more aggressive early controls, whereas improvements in Minnesota's local control (lower I) would allow more relaxed inbound flows. The cooperative balancing of controls across states and weeks flattens the imported infection curve, reducing cumulative cases and deaths in Minnesota. This strategic temporal modulation of traffic inflow is critical to managing epidemic risk while sustaining mobility and economic activity."

The imported infected flow can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing flow early when infection is higher helps control spread. We choose a strict-first pattern to front-load restrictions and reduce early imported cases, gradually relaxing controls as the weeks progress. This balances epidemic control by minimizing early introduction of infections while allowing some mobility later to reduce economic and social impact.

For states with lower or moderate epidemic pressure, an even or slightly relaxed-first pattern balances epidemic control with the need to maintain mobility and economic activity.\n\nQuantitatively, imported infected individuals from a given origin state are approximated as Flow * ft * (I/population).

The total 8-week traffic volume remains constant for fairness and economic considerations, but temporal redistribution leverages epidemic dynamics to optimize health outcomes.\n\nSensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls would be warranted to prevent surges. Conversely, if prevalence decreases faster than expected, mobility can be relaxed earlier without compromising control. The cooperative strategy across states ensures that no single state's traffic causes disproportionate risk spikes, distributing control efforts efficiently.\n\nOverall, this coordinated, data-driven approach balances the trade-off between epidemic suppression and mobility needs, reducing Minnesota's epidemic burden while sustaining necessary inbound travel."

  "global_guidance": "The overall approach balances the epidemic risks posed by varying infection prevalences and inflow volumes from origin states to Minnesota. States with higher infection prevalence and substantial inflow are assigned strict-first patterns, imposing stricter controls early in the 8 weeks to reduce initial imported infections, which is critical to preventing epidemic surges in Minnesota. This front-loading of restrictions allows gradual relaxation later to support economic and social mobility. States with lower prevalence or smaller inflow are assigned more even or relaxed-first patterns to maintain mobility while controlling risk. The imported infection risk is roughly proportional to Flow * ft * (I / population) for each origin state and week. By adjusting the fractions ft across weeks to front-load stricter controls for higher-risk states, the cumulative imported infections and thus confirmed and deceased cases in Minnesota are minimized. The allocation ensures total inbound flow remains constant for each origin state over 8 weeks, preserving overall mobility volume but shifting timing to reduce epidemic impact. Sensitivity considerations include how changes in infection prevalence or transmission rate beta would affect risk; if prevalence rises, stricter early controls become more beneficial, while if beta declines, more relaxed patterns might suffice. Cooperation across states by balancing restrictions reduces risk peaks and prevents overwhelming Minnesota's health system, while respecting mobility needs."

By adjusting the fractions ft across weeks to front-load stricter controls for higher-risk states, the cumulative imported infections and thus confirmed and deceased cases in Minnesota are minimized. The allocation ensures total inbound flow remains constant for each origin state over 8 weeks, preserving overall mobility volume but shifting timing to reduce epidemic impact. Sensitivity considerations include how changes in infection prevalence or transmission rate beta would affect risk; if prevalence rises, stricter early controls become more beneficial, while if beta declines, more relaxed patterns might suffice. Cooperation across states by balancing restrictions reduces risk peaks and prevents overwhelming Minnesota's health system, while respecting mobility needs."

  "global_guidance": "The collective strategy uses risk-based traffic allocation for all origin states to minimize imported infections into Minnesota. States with higher infection and exposed counts (e.g., Wisconsin, Arkansas, Tennessee) receive stricter early week controls (strict-first pattern) to sharply reduce early imported infections, preventing seeding and spread. States with lower or stable infection prevalence are managed with even or relaxed-first patterns, balancing epidemic control and economic mobility. The total inbound flow remains constant per state but is redistributed weekly to minimize risk during peak infection periods. Quantitatively, imported infections scale as Flow*ft*(I/population), so front-loading strict controls in states with higher I and E reduces Minnesota's cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early week controls become more critical, whereas lower prevalence allows for more relaxed patterns. This strategy balances epidemic control with mobility, preserving economic activity while protecting public health. All fractions per state sum exactly to 1, maintaining total mobility volume and ensuring policy feasibility."
