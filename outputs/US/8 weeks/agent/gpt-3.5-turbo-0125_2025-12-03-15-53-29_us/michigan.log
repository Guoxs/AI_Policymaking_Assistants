Given beta=0.0204 and the moderate incidence, the risk of importing infected individuals is proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population). Alabama's inflow is 8073.6 daily to Michigan. Since I/population is relatively low but non-negligible, a strict-first pattern is adopted to frontload restrictions when Michigan's infections are higher. The fractions sum to 1 exactly (0.15+0.14+0.13+0.12+0.11+0.10+0.13+0.12=1). This pattern balances epidemic control and mobility by reducing early week flows to minimize imported infections and relaxing later when Michigan's own cases may decrease. This trade-off aims to minimize cumulative cases and deaths by controlling early introductions from Alabama."

The allocation favors a relaxed-first pattern to allow more flow initially, assuming Michigan's control measures and monitoring can handle early imported cases, then tightening slightly mid-period to control potential spikes.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies carefully balance the epidemic risks from imported infections against the need for maintaining mobility and economic activity. Across all origin states, the total 8-week inbound flow remains constant, preserving essential travel and commerce. The control fractions adjust weekly proportions to minimize Michigan's cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically limiting travel during periods of higher infection pressure. States with higher infectious or exposed populations relative to their sizes, and thus higher infection pressure (e.g., Arkansas, South Carolina, Tennessee), receive stricter early-week controls to reduce early importation risk to Michigan when Michigan's own epidemic parameters indicate vulnerability. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or very large populations and inflows (e.g., Ohio, Texas, Indiana) adopt relaxed-first patterns allowing greater mobility initially but tightening later to prevent secondary waves. Even patterns are used for states with moderate or stable prevalence and inflows to maintain consistent control and avoid sudden mobility shocks. This cross-state and cross-week cooperation in traffic control substantially reduces the risk of imported infections overlapping and amplifying local outbreaks. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter frontloading of controls would be required to preserve epidemic control. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccination rates increase, mobility can be relaxed earlier. This dynamic, state-specific, and temporally adaptive approach optimizes epidemic control while sustaining vital interstate travel."

Early weeks are critical to prevent seeding new cases in Michigan, so states with high infected counts (e.g., Arkansas, Ohio, Texas) have stricter control early (lower fractions) to reduce initial imported infections. Conversely, lower risk states or those with moderate prevalence employ more even distributions to maintain mobility. The total inbound flow per origin state remains constant to respect economic and social factors. This staggered approach prevents overwhelming Michigan’s healthcare system by avoiding synchronized peaks in imported infections. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, front-loading stricter controls becomes more beneficial, while decreases allow more relaxed patterns. Cooperation across states ensures that infection import risks are spread out over time, reducing cumulative cases and deaths. Moreover, balancing mobility and epidemic control supports overall socio-economic stability, vital for sustained public health efforts.'

States with higher infection prevalence relative to their population and significant inbound flows (e.g., Arkansas, Alabama, Texas, Tennessee) adopt strict-first patterns that frontload traffic restrictions in the initial weeks, reducing early importation of active infections. This approach lowers secondary transmissions in Michigan by preventing early seeding. States with very high inbound flows but moderate infection levels (Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin) are allocated even traffic distributions to avoid sharp spikes in imported cases that could overwhelm health resources, balancing epidemic control with economic and mobility needs. Lower-risk states with smaller infectious populations and lower flows receive gradually relaxed control schedules after early strict reduction phases, optimizing both risk and mobility. Quantitatively, the imported infected cases approximate Flow * ft * (I / population), guiding the fraction allocations to reduce peak importation pressure while maintaining total flow constant. The allocations sum exactly to 1 for each state, ensuring consistency. Sensitivity analyses indicate that increases in infectious prevalence or transmission rate beta would necessitate stricter initial controls or longer duration of reduced mobility to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, reductions in these parameters allow more relaxed allocations. Cross-state cooperation in staggered traffic control reduces simultaneous high importation loads, distributing risks over time and space, enhancing Michigan's epidemic resilience. Overall, this strategy balances epidemic containment with socioeconomic needs via nuanced, data-driven traffic control fractions for each origin state over the next 8 weeks."

  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic control policy across all origin states adopts a predominantly strict-first pattern, especially for states with higher infection prevalence and inflows to Michigan, such as Ohio, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Tennessee. This approach front-loads stricter mobility restrictions to reduce early imported infections when Michigan's local epidemic is vulnerable, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. For states with moderate or low infection prevalence and inflow, an even or moderately strict-first pattern balances epidemic control with sustaining economic mobility. The total inbound flows remain unchanged over 8 weeks, preserving long-term mobility needs but redistributing weekly flows to reduce peak importation risks. Quantitatively, the expected imported infected cases approximate Flow*ft*(I/Population), so reducing ft during high-risk weeks in high-prevalence origin states effectively lowers imported infections. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early restrictions become more critical. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta is lower, more relaxed policies could be adopted earlier without substantially increasing risk. Balancing this with mobility needs is crucial to minimize social and economic disruptions. This coordinated, data-driven allocation mitigates cross-state epidemic spillover, protecting Michigan's population while accommodating essential travel over time."
