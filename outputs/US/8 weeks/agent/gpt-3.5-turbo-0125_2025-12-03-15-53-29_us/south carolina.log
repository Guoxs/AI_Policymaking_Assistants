Given its moderate infection prevalence (I/S ~ 8.4e-5) and fairly high average inflow (15,904 per day), imported infections can be estimated as Flow*ft*(I/population). A traffic pattern with stricter control initially (lower fractions in weeks 1-4) is chosen to reduce early importation of cases into South Carolina, allowing local outbreak control time. The fractions sum to exactly 1. This 'strict-first' pattern balances epidemic control and mobility by easing restrictions gradually as the risk diminishes or local control improves, helping preserve economic activity in the longer term."

The imported infected estimate Flow*ft*(I/population) suggests lower risk than Alabama.

States with lower infection prevalence and inflows, such as Iowa, Nebraska, and Virginia, have more even or relaxed patterns to maintain economic activity without significantly increasing risk. This staggered approach flattens the importation curve, avoiding surges in imported infections that could overwhelm local control measures. Quantitatively, imported infected cases from each state in week t are approximated by Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing ft in high-risk weeks lowers imported infections and thus cumulative cases and deaths. The sum of fractions for each state is exactly 1 to ensure total inbound flow remains constant, preserving travel volume while optimizing timing. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter control (lower ft) early in the timeline becomes even more critical to prevent spikes. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or local vaccination/immunity improves, relaxation can be accelerated safely. This coordinated cross-state policy reduces overall epidemic pressure on South Carolina by balancing temporal and spatial risks, optimizing public health outcomes and mobility."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic control policies for South Carolina from all origin states collectively aim to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by balancing epidemic control and economic mobility needs. States with higher infection and exposed rates relative to their populations, such as Idaho, Utah, Arkansas, and Michigan, are assigned stricter early restrictions (lower fractions in the first weeks) to reduce the importation of infected individuals during the critical early weeks when transmission risk is high. Conversely, states with lower infection pressures or stable trends are given more relaxed or even patterns to maintain essential mobility and economic activity. The use of strict-first patterns for high-risk states reduces initial imported infections, lowering South Carolina's epidemic growth rate. Relaxed-first patterns for moderate-risk states allow gradual lifting of controls, balancing public health with economic considerations. The quantitative cooperation logic involves distributing inbound traffic fractions so that weeks with lower fractions in one state can be balanced by higher fractions in others with lower infection prevalence, optimizing the overall risk profile. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission coefficients (beta) increase, stricter early controls would become more critical to prevent outbreaks, whereas decreasing prevalence or transmission allows earlier relaxation. The exact summation of fractions to 1 for each origin state ensures total inbound flow remains constant, providing a fair and feasible traffic control policy. This coordinated approach reduces the cumulative imported infections and deaths in South Carolina by timing the traffic flow to minimize exposure during peak infection periods across the origin states."

Given its moderate infectious load and large total population, the imported infected cases can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population), indicating that restricting flows in weeks with higher infection pressure can mitigate importation risks. The traffic allocation follows a slight relaxed-first pattern, gradually increasing control in the first week and relaxing thereafter, reflecting relatively stable but significant infectious pressure. This approach balances epidemic control with mobility needs, allowing some economic activity while restraining outbreak amplification.

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy balances epidemic control and mobility by adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions for each origin state without changing the total 8-week inbound volume. States with higher infected and exposed proportions relative to their populations, such as Utah, Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio, are assigned stricter control in the early weeks (strict-first pattern) to minimize early importation of infections into South Carolina, thus reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. States with lower or moderate infection pressures follow a relaxed-first pattern, starting with stricter controls and gradually relaxing, which balances control with economic and social mobility needs. This cooperative approach distributes the control efforts temporally and spatially, avoiding overwhelming restrictions in any single week or state and thereby enhancing compliance and mitigating economic impact. Quantitatively, imported infections are roughly proportional to the inbound flow, the fraction assigned to each week, and the infectious prevalence in the origin state. By shifting fractions towards later weeks when infection pressure might be lower or more manageable, the policy reduces early seeding risks. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission parameters (beta) increase, stricter early controls should be intensified. Conversely, if conditions improve, controls can be relaxed more quickly. This flexible framework permits adaptive policy tuning as epidemic conditions evolve, ensuring minimization of disease spread into South Carolina while maintaining essential mobility and economic activity."
