    "notes": "Alabama's infection prevalence is relatively low compared to its susceptible population (I=409, S=4,877,052). Given the moderate beta of 0.058, the infection pressure imported into Indiana from Alabama is moderate. The expected imported infected in week t can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I/S), so by modulating ft, we can reduce the peak import of infections. The traffic pattern chosen is relaxed-first, allowing more flow in the early weeks while tightening controls later. This is justified as Alabama's infected numbers are stable or mildly decreasing, allowing initial mobility to maintain economic and social activity, with stricter controls later to prevent resurgence. The trade-off balances epidemic control and mobility by smoothing traffic restrictions over time. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "This collective inbound traffic allocation strategy prioritizes minimizing imported infections and consequent deaths in Indiana by adjusting weekly traffic fractions per origin state while maintaining constant total inbound flow per state over 8 weeks. States with high infected prevalence (I/S ratio) and/or high inflow volumes (e.g., Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee) are assigned strict-first patterns with lower traffic fractions in early weeks to reduce early importation of infections, thereby flattening incidence curves and reducing epidemic amplification within Indiana. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or stabilized trends are assigned relaxed-first or even patterns to maintain economic and social mobility while managing infection risks. The quantitative logic uses the approximation that imported infections per week are proportional to Flow * ft * (I/S), enabling targeted modulation of the weekly fractions ft to minimize infection pressure without reducing total flow, preserving economic activity. This cross-state coordinated strategy balances epidemic control with mobility needs by distributing traffic restrictions temporally and spatially, avoiding excessive restrictions on any single state or period, which could lead to economic or social strain. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta were to increase, stricter early controls would be warranted to prevent importation surges. Conversely, reductions in prevalence or beta would allow more relaxed patterns without compromising epidemic control. The strategy is robust to parameter variations by maintaining the sum of fractions at 1 and dynamically scaling weekly fractions in response to infection trends, ensuring sustained epidemic suppression while preserving mobility. Overall, this policy framework leverages detailed epidemiological data and mobility baselines to optimize traffic flows into Indiana, minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases through evidence-based, adaptive traffic control measures."

The transmission rate beta=0.0584 combined with the current I suggests risk of importation proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population). Alabama's inflow to Indiana is significant (daily avg 10406), so traffic control is impactful. The fractions follow a relaxed-first pattern, gradually increasing mobility over weeks, because Alabama's infection level is moderate and stable, allowing initial stricter control to reduce imported infections. The trade-off balances epidemic control (reducing early spread) with mobility needs. The fractions sum to exactly 1, confirming allocation validity."

    "notes": "Arkansas shows relatively higher infected (I=1864) and exposed (E=3572) proportions compared to population (~2.98 million susceptible), indicating elevated risk of importation per Flow*ft*(I/population). Inflow is moderate (4286 daily). The strict-first pattern is adopted, with lower fractions early to suppress imported infections from Arkansas, then gradually relaxing control. This minimizes risk when Arkansas is most infectious, trading off some mobility upfront for longer-term epidemiological gains. Fractions sum to 1 verifying allocation correctness."

The expected imported infections can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / (S+E+I+Q+R+D)), where Flow is the daily average inbound flow. Given the moderate infection pressure, a slight 'relaxed-last' pattern is chosen, imposing stricter controls early to reduce immediate importation of infections, then relaxing gradually to allow more mobility later as risk diminishes. This balances epidemic control and mobility needs, as early suppression reduces outbreak seeding in Indiana while later weeks accommodate travel demand. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

Conversely, states with lower infection levels or smaller flows adopt more even or relaxed-first patterns to preserve economic activity and mobility, recognizing their lower contribution to importation risk. The allocation of traffic fractions always sums to exactly one for each state, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant, but temporal distribution is shifted to optimize epidemic outcomes. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections from an origin state in week t are approximated by Flow * ft * (I/population), linking imported infection risk directly to the fraction of flow allowed each week. By shifting traffic towards weeks with lower infection prevalence or implementing early strict controls, the policies reduce the cumulative imported infections and subsequent spread. The collective strategy balances epidemic control and mobility, recognizing that overly strict, prolonged restrictions harm economic and social needs, while insufficient controls risk epidemic resurgence. Sensitivity to parameter changes such as transmission rate (beta) or prevalence is addressed by emphasizing early restrictions for high-risk states and flexible relaxation for low-risk states, which remains effective across plausible parameter variations.

This front-loading of controls delays and reduces the cumulative imported infectious pressure, enabling Indiana's healthcare and control systems to better manage local transmission. States with lower infection prevalence and inflows (e.g., Iowa, Nebraska) receive more even distribution of control to balance mobility needs and epidemic risk. The total inbound flow per origin state remains constant, preserving overall mobility but shifting weekly proportions to strategically suppress high-risk periods. This coordinated approach balances disease control with economic and social mobility, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence (I/population) or transmission rate beta increases, stricter front-loaded controls become even more critical to prevent overwhelming Indiana's epidemic dynamics. Conversely, if prevalence declines, allocations could gradually shift towards more relaxed patterns to enhance mobility. Cross-state cooperation in adjusting weekly inbound fractions based on infection pressure and flow volume optimizes epidemic control outcomes while respecting mobility baselines, demonstrating the importance of dynamic, data-driven traffic management in epidemic settings."
