Using beta=0.115, the risk of importation is proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population). Given the consistent infection levels, but relatively lower inflow (1413 daily), a strict-first pattern (lower fractions initially) helps reduce early imported infections, flattening outbreaks in Nebraska. This approach balances mobility and epidemic control by gradually relaxing controls, allowing economic activity to resume after the initial risk phase. The fractions sum exactly to 1.0000."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Nebraska, the inbound traffic control policy balances early strictness with later relaxation across origin states based on infection prevalence and mobility volume. States with higher infected and exposed populations and/or larger inflows (e.g., Iowa, Idaho, Texas, Minnesota) employ a strict-first pattern to mitigate early importation risk, flattening the epidemic curve and preventing overwhelming outbreaks. This front-loaded control reduces the seeding of infections in Nebraska during the initial critical weeks. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure or smaller inflows maintain an even pattern to preserve mobility and economic activity without substantial risk increases. The quantitative logic relies on the proportionality of imported infections to Flow*ft*(I/population), guiding fraction allocations to reduce early infections when risk is highest. The cumulative inbound flow per state remains constant, preserving overall mobility but redistributing it temporally to optimize epidemic outcomes. This cooperative cross-state strategy balances regional risks, preventing shifting infection burdens from one state to another and smoothing demand on Nebraska's healthcare system. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls become more critical, further favoring strict-first patterns. Conversely, lower prevalence allows more relaxed or even patterns. This adaptive policy, grounded in SEIQRD model parameters and population data, aims to minimize disease spread while maintaining essential mobility, thus protecting public health and economic stability."

The expected imported infected cases are proportional to flow * fraction * (I / population), where population is roughly sum of SEIQRD, dominated by susceptible. Given the relatively low exposed and infected numbers, traffic control can be gradually relaxed. We choose a strict-first pattern, initially enforcing tighter control (fractions 0.05 in weeks 1 and 2) to minimize imported infections when local cases in Nebraska might be vulnerable. Then controls relax gradually as we spread the inbound flow over later weeks, allowing economic mobility while managing risk. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.05+0.05+0.10+0.10+0.15+0.15+0.20+0.20=1). This balances epidemic control with the need to maintain flow, reducing risk early while permitting more inbound flow later."

Expected imported infected cases scale as flow * fraction * (I / population). To reduce epidemic risk to Nebraska, we apply a strict-first pattern with lower fractions in early weeks (0.04 each for weeks 1 and 2), gradually relaxing controls later. This strategy reduces peak imported infections during critical early weeks, balancing mobility needs. The fractions sum to exactly 1 (0.04+0.04+0.08+0.10+0.15+0.15+0.22+0.22=1). This approach minimizes imported infections while allowing economic activity to resume progressively."

The risk of imported infections is high, proportional to flow * fraction * (I / population).

This minimizes early epidemic risk in Nebraska while maintaining overall inbound flow. The fractions sum to exactly 1.

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic control policy for Nebraska strategically allocates weekly inbound fractions to minimize imported infections and subsequent confirmed and deceased cases. Each origin state's SEIQRD data informs the infection pressure, with higher infected and exposed proportions leading to stricter early week controls (lower fractions). By applying a strict-first pattern universally, the policy reduces imported infection risk during early weeks when Nebraska's population could be most vulnerable, thus flattening the epidemic curve locally. This front-loading of restrictions followed by gradual relaxation balances epidemic control and economic mobility. The total inbound flow over 8 weeks remains constant per origin state, preserving overall mobility and economic activity. Quantitatively, imported infected cases approximate Flow * fraction * (I / population), so reducing fractions in weeks with high infection pressure lowers total imported infections. Coordinating across states ensures that the aggregate imported infection pressure is smoothed over time, preventing epidemic spikes in Nebraska. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early week controls become even more critical, while lower prevalence allows more even flow distribution. This policy is robust to moderate changes in parameters due to its gradual relaxation pattern and total flow conservation, offering a practical balance between public health and mobility."

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy is to allocate inbound traffic fractions primarily using a strict-first pattern across all origin states, reflecting the need to minimize early imported infections into Nebraska when local infections are still significant (I=935, E=10034). By reducing traffic in the initial weeks (low fractions), Nebraska can limit external infection pressure, helping to flatten the epidemic curve, reduce confirmed cases, and deaths. Later weeks gradually relax controls to allow economic and social activities to resume with lower infection risk. Quantitatively, imported infected cases from each state approximate Flow * fraction * (I / State Population). By modulating fractions over the 8 weeks while keeping total flow constant, we redistribute travel to weeks with presumably lower epidemic pressure, mitigating peaks. Cross-state cooperation is implicit; states with higher infected prevalence or inbound flows receive stricter early restrictions. This coordinated approach balances epidemic control with mobility, minimizing overall imported infections. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become more critical to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, fractions can approach a more even distribution to support mobility. This flexible framework supports dynamic adaptation as epidemic conditions evolve. All fractions per state sum exactly to 1.0, ensuring total inbound flow remains consistent with ground truth, maintaining policy credibility and fairness."
