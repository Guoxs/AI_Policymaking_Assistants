Given the beta=0.033 and other SEIRD parameters, the risk of imported infections is proportional to inbound flow multiplied by the infected proportion. Since Alabama's inflow is moderate, a strict-first pattern is chosen to apply stricter control in the initial weeks to suppress early imported infections and then gradually relax as epidemic pressure decreases or as adaptive control is feasible.

  },
  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy balances epidemic control and mobility by adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions for each origin state while keeping total 8-week flow constant. States with higher infection prevalence and inbound flow, such as Arkansas, Idaho, Michigan, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Utah, are assigned a strict-first control pattern to reduce early imported infections, minimizing seeding events in Virginia. Conversely, states with moderate infected counts but high flow, such as Ohio, Kentucky, and Wisconsin, adopt a relaxed-first pattern to balance economic activity and health outcomes, imposing stricter controls later to curb cumulative cases. Low prevalence states like Iowa and Minnesota maintain even flow to preserve mobility with minimal risk. This cooperative allocation spreads risk temporally and spatially, reducing peak imported infections and deaths. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls become more critical to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence falls, more even or relaxed patterns suffice. The approach respects constraints on flow sums and fraction bounds, ensuring feasibility and fairness among states. Overall, this coordinated policy minimizes cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia by dynamically modulating inbound traffic based on origin state epidemic states."

The strict-first pattern predominates, as it reduces importation of exposed and infected individuals when viral transmission risk is highest. Since imported infections approximate Flow*ft*(I/population), front-loading stricter controls in weeks 1-4 across high-risk states reduces the seeding of new cases in Virginia. Later weeks see progressively relaxed controls to balance economic and social mobility needs. This cooperative approach balances risk by temporal staggering of flows to prevent simultaneous high importation risks from multiple states. Sensitivity analysis shows that if beta (transmission rate) or prevalence increases, stricter early controls become even more critical to prevent exponential growth of cases. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, slightly relaxed patterns could be justified. The total inbound flows remain constant by preserving sum of fractions at exactly 1 for each origin state, ensuring compliance with the constraint. This allocation strategy thus optimally manages the trade-off between epidemic control and mobility, reducing overall morbidity and mortality in Virginia.'

States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to their size, or those with large inflow volumes, receive stronger initial traffic restrictions (lower fractions) that gradually relax over the 8 weeks. This strict-first pattern leverages the epidemiological principle that early seeding of infections can greatly amplify local outbreaks, so limiting inflow during critical early periods reduces cumulative cases and deaths. The sum-to-one constraint ensures total flow remains constant per state, maintaining fairness and compliance feasibility. Coordination across states balances infection risks; higher-risk origin states face stricter early controls, while lower-risk ones have more even or slightly relaxed patterns. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early restrictions become even more beneficial. Conversely, if prevalence falls or vaccination improves, gradual relaxation could accelerate. This policy thus dynamically balances epidemic control with socio-economic mobility needs, using epidemiological data and mobility baselines to optimize timing and extent of traffic restrictions for maximum public health benefit in Virginia.'
