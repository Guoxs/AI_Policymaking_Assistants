With a daily average inflow of 1349.7, imported infected can be approximated as inflow * fraction * (I / total population), which is small but not negligible. Given the relatively stable infection prevalence, a relaxed-first pattern is chosen, allowing slightly higher traffic in later weeks when natural epidemic decline is expected due to recovery and control in origin state, and imposing somewhat stricter controls early on to suppress importing infections. This balances epidemic control and mobility by minimizing risk when infection pressure is higher and relaxing once safer. The fractions sum to exactly 1.0000, ensuring total flow is maintained."

Its large average daily inflow of 23848.9 to Utah means imported infections can be significant: inflow * fraction * (I / population). Given a trend of increasing recovery (R=2333) and confirmed cases (Q=36780), infection pressure may be decreasing over time.

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy focuses on minimizing imported infections into Utah by adjusting weekly traffic fractions from each origin state while keeping total 8-week inflow constant. States with higher infected and exposed proportions relative to their population, and with higher inflow to Utah, are prioritized for stricter early-week control to reduce immediate importation risk. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure or smaller inflow have more balanced or relaxed patterns. Relaxed-first patterns dominate because they suppress imports during peak infection prevalence in origin states and allow gradual mobility restoration as infection pressure declines, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Utah. The total flow constraint ensures no reduction in overall connectivity, preserving essential mobility and economic activity. This coordinated approach balances epidemic control and mobility, preventing overwhelming healthcare while mitigating socio-economic impact. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early-week controls become even more critical, while reductions in prevalence allow faster relaxation. Cross-state cooperation in scheduling traffic control allows Utah to efficiently manage importation risk across heterogeneous epidemic conditions. This approach is robust to varying epidemic dynamics and supports adaptive policy adjustments based on real-time surveillance data."

    "notes": "Alabama has a relatively low infectious population (I=354) compared to its susceptible population (S=4,854,873). Given the low infection prevalence, the risk of imported infections is moderate. The expected imported infected cases can be approximated by Flow * ft * (I / total population), indicating that reducing flow in early weeks with higher disease prevalence can reduce infections in Utah. We adopt a strict-first pattern, allocating lower fractions in the initial weeks to curb early importation, then gradually relaxing controls. The trade-off favors epidemic control early on while allowing mobility later to balance economic and social needs. The fractions sum to exactly 1, meeting constraints."

Imported infections scale with Flow * ft * (I / population), so reducing flows early when infection pressure is higher is beneficial. Given the increasing trend in infections and exposure, a strict-first pattern is chosen, with the lowest fractions in the earliest weeks and a gradual relaxation over time. This approach balances disease control by minimizing early importation and preserves mobility in later weeks. The fractions sum to 1 exactly."

States with higher infection prevalence (I relative to population) and/or high average daily inflows to Utah receive stricter early traffic restrictions (lower fractions in early weeks) to minimize immediate imported infections. For example, Idaho and Arkansas have higher infected counts and substantial inflow volumes, warranting strict-first patterns with reduced early traffic to curb importation risk. Conversely, states with low infection burdens and lower inflows, such as Kentucky and Virginia, have more relaxed-first patterns allowing early mobility to sustain economic and social activities while maintaining surveillance. The sum of fractions per state strictly equals 1 to conserve total inbound flow over 8 weeks as required, redistributing weekly proportions to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Utah. The strategy leverages quantitative infection risk logic: expected imported infections approximate inflow * fraction * (I/population), informing patterns that lower fractions during periods of peak infection prevalence to reduce seeding. Cross-state coordination ensures that high-risk states reduce early traffic simultaneously, distributing risk temporally and spatially to prevent overwhelming Utah's local health system. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early restrictions become more critical, and if these parameters decrease, more balanced or relaxed patterns are viable. This dynamic, data-informed approach aims to slow disease spread while accommodating essential mobility."

Given the inflow of 1296 daily to Utah, imported infections can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population). Since Alabama's infection rate is moderate, a strict-first pattern is chosen to reduce early week importation risk, allocating lower fractions in the initial weeks to curb early imported infections while allowing moderate mobility later. This balances epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs. The fractions sum exactly to 1."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Utah, the strategy balances strict early traffic control for origin states with higher infection pressures and relaxed control for states with lower or moderate pressures. States with higher infected and exposed counts relative to their population and with high inflow volumes (e.g., Idaho, Arizona, Texas) adopt relaxed-first or delayed relaxation patterns to avoid overwhelming Utah's healthcare system early while allowing phased economic mobility. For states with moderate to low infection pressure and lower inflow (e.g., Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi), strict-first patterns reduce early imported infections, cutting transmission chains early. The total daily inflow from all states remains constant, preserving overall mobility but redistributing weekly fractions to minimize importation risk during vulnerable periods. The coordination across states ensures that the cumulative imported infections are spread over time, preventing peak overload while sustaining some mobility. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls should be intensified, particularly for states with rising infection counts. Conversely, if beta decreases or vaccination improves, controls may be further relaxed earlier. This joint cross-state and temporal traffic allocation effectively balances epidemic control with economic and social needs, minimizing disease burden in Utah."
