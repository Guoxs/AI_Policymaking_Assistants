  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic allocation pattern across all origin states prioritizes early strict controls (strict-first pattern) for states with higher infection and exposed counts to reduce the initial imported infection pressure on Alabama. The approach minimizes the risk of seeding new infections during weeks when Alabama's own infected population is still moderate, thus limiting epidemic growth early. States with lower infection prevalence or population risk (e.g., Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska) receive more even traffic distributions to maintain essential mobility while controlling risk. This cooperative risk balancing reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths by limiting high-risk traffic early and allowing controlled relaxation later to support economic and social activity. The quantitative logic follows that imported infections are proportional to inbound flow times the infected fraction in the origin state population, so front-loading controls on high-risk states effectively reduces total imported infection pressure. Sensitivity analysis suggests if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls would be even more critical to prevent exponential growth. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, traffic can be more evenly distributed to enhance mobility. This adaptive and coordinated policy leverages temporal shifts in traffic control to optimize epidemic control with minimal disruption."

With beta=0.0639 and alpha=0.4248, the infection transmission potential is moderate. The imported infected cases roughly estimate as Flow * ft * (I / Total Population). Arizona's infected proportion is about 899/12481037, which is low but non-negligible. Due to a slight increase in infection exposure recently, a strict-first pattern is chosen to reduce inflow in the earlier weeks (lower fractions in weeks 1-3) to suppress initial imported infections. The fractions increase gradually allowing more relaxed controls in later weeks when internal alabama control measures may reduce overall risk. This pattern balances epidemic control by front-loading restrictions while allowing eventual mobility. Sum of fractions is exactly 1."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce expected imported infections and deaths in Alabama, the inbound traffic allocations prioritize strict control in early weeks for origin states with higher infection prevalence and larger inflow (e.g., Tennessee, Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi). This front-loading of restrictions minimizes seeding of new infections when Alabama's internal epidemic may still be vulnerable. States with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflow (e.g., Nebraska, Utah) are given relatively relaxed early controls to balance mobility and economic needs. This strategy leverages the temporal dynamics of the epidemic, as early suppression of imported infections reduces cumulative cases and deaths over the 8-week horizon. The allocations sum precisely to one for each state, ensuring that the total inbound flow remains constant but temporally redistributed. Quantitatively, imported infections approximate the product of flow, fraction, and infection prevalence (I/population), so shifting fractions to minimize early importation from high-risk states reduces overall epidemic burden. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if beta or infection prevalence rises, stricter early restrictions may be warranted, while lower prevalence or transmission could allow more relaxed controls. The balanced strategy ensures that mobility needs are accommodated without compromising epidemic control, and cross-state cooperation in timing and degree of restrictions optimizes outcomes for Alabama."

The imported infected estimate roughly follows Flow*ft*(I/population), with inflow=3121.6 and infected prevalence ~0.000087. To minimize importation risk, a slightly stricter control in early weeks (f1=0.10) reduces initial seeding, with gradual relaxation to balance economic needs. The pattern chosen is relaxed-first (increasing fractions) because the infection pressure appears stable and moderate; strict initial control delays peak imported cases.

States with moderate risk adopt even or relaxed-first patterns to maintain steady control and mobility. This cooperative approach balances epidemic control across states and weeks, preventing simultaneous high importation from multiple sources. Quantitatively, imported infected cases roughly scale with Flow*ft*(I/population), so lowering early ft in high-risk states reduces initial imported infections and subsequent local transmission. Sensitivity analysis shows if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early control would be even more critical; conversely, lower prevalence allows more relaxed policies.
