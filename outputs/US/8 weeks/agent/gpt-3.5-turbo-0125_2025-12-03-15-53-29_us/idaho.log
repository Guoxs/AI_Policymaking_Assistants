The risk of imported infections depends approximately on Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)). Given the steady infection levels and no evidence of rising trends, an even distribution (even pattern) of inbound traffic over 8 weeks is appropriate. This spreads the risk evenly without concentrating inflow in any specific week, balancing epidemic control and mobility needs. Strict or relaxed first patterns are not justified as infection prevalence is stable without spikes. The fractions sum exactly to 1, satisfying constraints."

  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic control policy for Idaho strategically balances epidemic control and mobility by adjusting weekly inbound traffic fractions for each origin state based on their infection prevalence and flow volumes. States with higher infected counts relative to their susceptible populations, such as Utah, South Carolina, Michigan, and Arkansas, have stricter initial controls (lower fractions in early weeks) to minimize early importation of cases when Idaho's local epidemic is still significant. This 'strict-first' pattern reduces the risk of seeding outbreaks. States with lower infection prevalence or more stable epidemic conditions, such as Alabama, Ohio, and Texas, follow even or relaxed-first patterns, allowing for smoother mobility while still managing risk. The weekly fractions for each state sum exactly to one, ensuring consistent total inbound flow over 8 weeks as mandated. This distribution of risk across time and states helps avoid overwhelming Idaho's healthcare system and prevents spikes in confirmed and deceased cases. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase in origin states, stricter early controls and more weighted reduction in early weeks would be necessary to maintain epidemic control. Conversely, lower infection levels or effective local interventions could permit more relaxed patterns. This coordinated approach leverages the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of the epidemic across states, optimizing Idaho's inbound traffic allocations to minimize cumulative imported infections, confirmed cases, and deaths, while balancing economic and social mobility demands."

Conversely, relaxed-first or even distributions are applied to states with lower or steady infection pressure to balance economic and social mobility needs. Quantitatively, imported infected individuals approximately follow Flow*ft*(I/population) scaling; thus, reducing ft in early weeks for high-risk states lowers cumulative importation risk. This balanced approach also considers mobility baselines to avoid excessive economic disruption. Sensitivity to parameters like beta (transmission rate) implies that if beta increases, stricter early controls become more critical, whereas lower beta allows more relaxed allocations. Similarly, shifts in prevalence (I or E) in origin states would require recalibration of timing and intensity of restrictions. The strategy maintains the total inbound flow constant per origin state over 8 weeks, only redistributing weekly fractions to optimize disease control without overly restricting total mobility.

The infection prevalence is low (I/S ~0.000115), suggesting moderate risk. The expected imported infected can be approximated by Flow*ft*(I/population). Given the daily inflow of 556.8, weighting the inbound flow evenly over the first four weeks (strict-first pattern) reduces early seeding of infections in Idaho, which currently has moderate infections (I=3,520). The latter weeks have relaxed flow fractions as Idahos epidemic state may improve or control measures take effect. The total fractions sum to 1 (sum=1 exactly). This pattern balances epidemic control and mobility by front-loading stricter controls when risk is higher and gradually relaxing."

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic control policy is designed to minimize imported infections into Idaho by allocating stricter traffic restrictions earlier in the 8-week period for states with higher infectious prevalence and inflow volumes, such as Utah, Arkansas, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. This front-loading of restrictions reduces early seeding of infections that could trigger wider outbreaks in Idaho, which currently has a moderate infection level. Conversely, states with lower infectious prevalence or lower inflow volumes adopt more relaxed or delayed restrictions to balance the socioeconomic impact of mobility constraints. The quantitative logic is based on the expected imported infections approximated by Flow*ft*(I/population), where Flow is fixed and ft are weekly fractions summing to 1. By choosing strict-first patterns for high-risk states, the policy effectively reduces early importation risk, allowing Idaho's own epidemic control measures to be more effective. The relaxed-first patterns for some states account for potential epidemic dynamics, delaying higher traffic volumes until infection risks potentially decline. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if the transmission rate beta increases, stricter early restrictions become even more critical to curb infection importation. Conversely, if infectious prevalence decreases in origin states, the policy can afford more relaxed inbound flow earlier. The cooperation between states through differential weekly allocations ensures Idaho manages overall inbound infection pressure efficiently while maintaining necessary mobility. All fraction arrays sum exactly to 1, ensuring consistency with the fixed total inbound flows."

The relaxed-first patterns for some states account for potential epidemic dynamics, delaying higher traffic volumes until infection risks potentially decline. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if the transmission rate beta increases, stricter early restrictions become even more critical to curb infection importation. Conversely, if infectious prevalence decreases in origin states, the policy can afford more relaxed inbound flow earlier. The cooperation between states through differential weekly allocations ensures Idaho manages overall inbound infection pressure efficiently while maintaining necessary mobility. All fraction arrays sum exactly to 1, ensuring consistency with the fixed total inbound flows."

Given the moderate beta and other parameters, the risk of imported infections is proportional to Flow * ft * (I/Population). The inbound flow to Idaho from Alabama is low (677 daily average), so strict traffic control all along is not critical. We adopt a slightly strict-first pattern to reduce early imported infections, with fractions lower in early weeks (0.12) and modest relaxation in week 7 (0.16) when Idaho cases may be better controlled. The sum of fractions is exactly 1. This pattern balances epidemiological risk and mobility needs, minimizing early epidemic seeding while allowing some mobility later as Idaho's own epidemic may improve."

  "global_guidance": "The overall traffic control policy for inbound flow into Idaho strategically balances epidemic control and mobility preservation by adjusting weekly traffic fractions per origin state according to their infectious prevalence and flow magnitude. States with high infection prevalence and large inbound flow, notably Utah and Texas, receive strict-first traffic control patterns with very low early-week fractions to minimize imported infections at Idaho's epidemic onset, reducing seeding risk and subsequent transmissions. Conversely, states with lower infectious prevalence or smaller flow volumes, such as Arkansas and Mississippi, are assigned more even traffic allocations, balancing steady mobility with moderate epidemic control. The strict-first patterns delay importations from high-risk states, allowing Idaho's own epidemic control measures to stabilize local dynamics before gradually relaxing controls to restore economic activity. The total inbound flow from each origin state is conserved exactly by ensuring the fractions sum to one, preserving overall mobility demand while redistributing it temporally to minimize epidemic impact. This coordinated temporal redistribution across all origin states reduces cumulative infections and deaths in Idaho by lowering simultaneous importation pressure. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early-week controls should be prioritized, especially for states with high infection prevalence and flow. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, controls can be relaxed earlier to resume mobility sooner. The policy thus adapts to epidemiological realities while safeguarding mobility, aiming for minimal epidemic burden combined with feasible economic activity."
