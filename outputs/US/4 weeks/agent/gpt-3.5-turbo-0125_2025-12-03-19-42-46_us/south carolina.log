  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic control policy for inbound flow into South Carolina strategically balances epidemic risk and mobility needs across all origin states. States with higher infection prevalence relative to their population—such as Idaho, Arkansas, New Mexico, Utah, and Tennessee—adopt a strict-first pattern, imposing stricter controls in initial weeks to reduce early importation of infectious individuals, which is critical to minimizing cumulative cases and deaths. This pattern helps flatten the curve of imported infections, allowing South Carolina's health system more time to respond. Conversely, states with lower or moderate infection levels utilize even distributions, ensuring steady but controlled inflow that avoids sudden surges in infection risk. This harmonized approach leverages the formula of imported infected cases approximately equal to Flow * ft * (I / population), adjusting weekly fractions ft to reduce peak infectious importation while maintaining economic activity. The weekly fractions sum to exactly 1 for every state, preserving total inbound flow but redistributing it temporally to maximize epidemic control. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates beta increase, stricter front-loading controls become more beneficial to curb importation early. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed patterns can be adopted safely. The policy reflects quantitative cooperation between states, dynamically allocating stricter controls where infection pressure is higher and smoothing traffic to reduce aggregate risk. This coordinated strategy optimizes the trade-off between epidemic mitigation and mobility, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in South Carolina over the coming month."

States with higher infection prevalence relative to their population—such as Idaho, Arkansas, New Mexico, Utah, and Tennessee—adopt a strict-first pattern, imposing stricter controls in initial weeks to reduce early importation of infectious individuals, which is critical to minimizing cumulative cases and deaths. This pattern helps flatten the curve of imported infections, allowing South Carolina's health system more time to respond. Conversely, states with lower or moderate infection levels utilize even distributions, ensuring steady but controlled inflow that avoids sudden surges in infection risk. This harmonized approach leverages the formula of imported infected cases approximately equal to Flow * ft * (I / population), adjusting weekly fractions ft to reduce peak infectious importation while maintaining economic activity. The weekly fractions sum to exactly 1 for every state, preserving total inbound flow but redistributing it temporally to maximize epidemic control. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates beta increase, stricter front-loading controls become more beneficial to curb importation early. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed patterns can be adopted safely. The policy reflects quantitative cooperation between states, dynamically allocating stricter controls where infection pressure is higher and smoothing traffic to reduce aggregate risk. This coordinated strategy optimizes the trade-off between epidemic mitigation and mobility, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in South Carolina over the coming month."

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy to allocate inbound flows over four weeks among all origin states aims to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in South Carolina by managing the importation of infected individuals. States with higher infection prevalence (high I and E relative to population) such as Idaho, Ohio, Utah, and Arkansas receive a strict-first pattern, reducing inbound flow in early weeks to mitigate immediate import risks. This prevents sudden spikes in imported infections that could overwhelm local control measures. Conversely, states with lower infection rates or more stable epidemics employ even or relaxed-first patterns, balancing epidemic control with economic mobility needs. The sum of fractions for each state is maintained at exactly 1 to preserve the total inbound flow volume, ensuring that restrictions modulate timing rather than volume. This cross-state coordination balances importation risk temporally, smoothing infection pressure on South Carolina's healthcare and epidemic control systems. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early controls become more critical to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, if local immunity or control improves, relaxed patterns can be adopted sooner to restore mobility. This adaptive approach optimizes epidemic control while minimizing social and economic disruption across the network of states."

    "notes": "Alabama shows moderate exposed (E=1468) and infected (I=457) relative to its large susceptible population (S=4857550). Given a high average past inflow and substantial infected pool, the risk of imported infections is proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population). To reduce infection importation, we adopt a strict-first pattern with heavier control in week 1 (fraction 0.30) and gradually relax to week 4 (0.20). This approach minimizes early imported cases when the local epidemic is still active. The trade-off is reduced mobility initially but maintains economic activity in later weeks. The fractions sum exactly to 1 to preserve flow volume."

Risk of imported infection is high early on, so a strict-first pattern is appropriate: tighter control early (f1=0.28) then gradual relaxation. This reduces immediate imported infections while balancing mobility needs later. The fractions sum to 1 ensuring total inflow remains constant."

  "global_guidance": "The aggregate inbound traffic allocation strategy for South Carolina aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically modulating weekly inbound flows from each origin state based on their infection pressure and inflow volumes. States with higher infected (I) and exposed (E) populations relative to their susceptible (S) population and with higher inflow volumes into South Carolina are assigned stricter controls in earlier weeks (low fractions) to reduce the number of infectious individuals entering when the local epidemic would be most vulnerable to new introductions. This strict-first pattern is applied for states like Ohio, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Michigan, where early reduction in imported infections can significantly curb local transmission. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure or moderate inflow have even distributions, balancing mobility and control without causing undue economic disruption. This cooperative approach ensures that total inbound flow from each state remains constant over 4 weeks, preserving essential movement while redistributing it temporally to minimize epidemic peaks. The fractions for each state sum exactly to 1, ensuring no net change in total flow but optimized weekly allocation. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence (I/population) or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls become more critical to prevent importation-driven outbreaks. In contrast, if beta decreases or local control improves, allocations could be relaxed earlier. This coordinated inter-state traffic control strategy leverages both epidemic data and mobility patterns to effectively minimize imported infections and subsequent morbidity and mortality in South Carolina."

The imported infections are roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population). Given the relatively stable but non-negligible infection prevalence, a strict-first traffic allocation pattern is chosen to frontload stricter control in the initial weeks to reduce early imported infections. This pattern benefits from leveraging reduced infections later in the control period to gradually relax traffic. The trade-off balances early epidemic control by lowering week 1 and 2 inflow fractions, while accepting higher mobility in weeks 3 and 4. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic control policy across all origin states is designed to minimize imported infections and subsequent cases and deaths in South Carolina by strategically allocating inbound flow fractions over the next 4 weeks. States with higher infection prevalence (I and E) and larger inflow volumes (e.g., Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Tennessee) receive a strict-first pattern, which frontloads stricter control in weeks 1 and 2 to reduce early epidemic seeding in South Carolina. This reduces the cumulative imported infections since early infections have greater potential to spark local outbreaks. States with moderate or stable infection levels and inflow adopt even fraction distributions to balance mobility and epidemic control without causing spikes in risk. A few states with moderate infections but lower immediate risk use relaxed-first or gradual control escalation to maintain some mobility early. The quantitative cooperation logic hinges on the proportionality of imported infected cases to Flow*ft*(I/population), highlighting the importance of lowering ft in weeks with high infection pressure. By spreading restrictions temporally and across states, the policy avoids overwhelming mobility disruptions while achieving epidemic control. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, the strict-first approach becomes more critical, emphasizing early restrictions. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta lowers, more even or relaxed patterns may suffice. This adaptive strategy ensures that South Carolina's epidemic risk is minimized by coordinating inbound traffic control, balancing public health and economic considerations effectively."

  "global_guidance": "The collective approach to inbound traffic control from all origin states into South Carolina aims to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by strategically allocating inbound flows over the next four weeks. States with higher infection and exposure prevalence relative to their populations receive stricter early-week controls (low fractions in weeks 1 and 2) to reduce early importation of infections, which is critical because early importations can seed local outbreaks and increase cumulative cases. This relaxed-first or strict-first pattern is chosen based on infection prevalence trends: states with high or increasing infection pressure implement stricter early restrictions, while states with steadier or lower prevalence use even distribution to maintain mobility and control. Quantitatively, expected imported infections scale approximately with Flow*ft*(I/population), so redistributing fractions reduces importation during peak infection periods. The cooperation across states balances traffic control so that overall inbound flow remains constant but is temporally shifted to minimize risk peaks. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early control fractions should be intensified to maintain epidemic suppression; conversely, if prevalence falls, traffic can be more evenly distributed. This approach balances epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs, ensuring that cumulative importation risk is managed without excessive prolonged restrictions. The exact summation of fractions to 1 for each state ensures total inbound flows remain consistent with ground truth, preserving travel demand while strategically modulating timing to reduce disease spread."

The imported infected cases are expected to be proportional to the inbound flow multiplied by the infected fraction I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D) ~ 742/4864707. The flow from Alabama is significant (10933 daily), so the risk of importing infected individuals is non-negligible. Since the infection levels appear stable without sharp trends, an even traffic allocation pattern is chosen for Alabama to maintain mobility while controlling risk steadily across all weeks. This balances epidemic control and economic activity without sudden changes. The fractions sum to exactly 1.0000, validating distribution."

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy for inbound traffic allocation into South Carolina from origin states aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by balancing epidemic control and mobility across 4 weeks. States with higher infection prevalence relative to their population and substantial inbound flow receive stricter control in later weeks (strict-first pattern) to front-load epidemic suppression and reduce cumulative importations. Conversely, states showing signs of improving infection trends or lower infection prevalence are assigned a relaxed-first pattern, allowing mobility to gradually increase as risk diminishes. States with moderate and stable infection levels adopt an even allocation pattern for steady management. This cross-state coordination distributes epidemic risk temporally and spatially, avoiding overwhelming South Carolina's control capacity while preserving essential mobility. Quantitatively, expected imported infections are proportional to the product of inbound flow, weekly fraction, and infection prevalence (I/population). By modulating the fractions, the policy reduces imported infections during high-risk periods, thereby lowering secondary transmissions and deaths. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence rises or transmission rate beta increases, stricter front-loaded controls become more critical to contain spread. Similarly, if prevalence decreases or beta lowers, relaxed-first or even patterns suffice, enhancing mobility with limited risk. This cooperative temporal-spatial balancing effectively manages imported infection risks and epidemic burden, optimizing public health and economic outcomes for South Carolina."

The expected imported infected cases can be approximated by Flow * ft * (I / population), suggesting that a high inbound flow fraction in weeks with higher infection prevalence would increase risk. To reduce the imported infection risk, the pattern chosen is 'strict-first,' with stricter control in the first weeks (f1=0.35, f2=0.30) to reduce initial importation, gradually relaxing later as local controls improve. This pattern balances epidemic control by limiting early transmission while allowing some mobility later to support economic activity.

States with higher infected proportions and/or higher inbound flow (e.g., Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Arkansas) adopt a 'strict-first' pattern to apply stronger restrictions early, minimizing initial seeding and cumulative infections. States with lower infection pressure or smaller flows (e.g., Iowa, Nebraska) follow 'relaxed-first' or 'even' patterns, allowing more mobility initially but still controlling risk. This cross-state risk balancing is critical, as infections imported early can exponentially increase local cases, so reducing flow fractions in weeks with higher infection prevalence optimizes control. Quantitatively, imported infections scale with Flow * ft * (I / population), so lowering ft in early weeks for high-risk states significantly reduces imported cases. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence rises or transmission rates (beta) increase, stronger early restrictions become even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence falls or beta decreases, fraction allocations could be more relaxed. This dynamic framework enables adaptive control balancing epidemic goals and economic needs while ensuring the sum of fractions per state equals exactly 1, maintaining total mobility volume. This policy aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically timing mobility restrictions based on origin state risk profiles."

The traffic allocation follows a strict-first pattern, imposing stricter controls in the last two weeks (fractions 0.2 each) to curb possible increases in imported cases later, as infections are moderately high.

  "global_guidance": "This traffic control policy collectively aims to minimize imported infections and deaths in South Carolina by strategically adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions for each origin state while keeping total flow constant. States with higher infection pressures (higher I and E relative to population) such as Idaho, Utah, New Mexico, and Arkansas have adopted relaxed-first patterns with stricter early controls to suppress initial importation risk before allowing more mobility. States with moderate infection pressure and large susceptible populations, like Alabama, Kentucky, Michigan, and Texas, use even traffic distribution to balance risk and economic activity. States with moderate to high infection pressure but large flows (e.g., Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia) use strict-first patterns to reduce importation risk later in the period when cumulative risk would be higher. This diversified approach balances epidemic control and mobility needs across states and weeks, reducing peak importation risk and spreading traffic to avoid overwhelming health systems. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early control fractions would be beneficial to suppress early imported infections. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more even or relaxed patterns could be adopted to enhance mobility. This policy is designed to be adaptive and data-driven, leveraging SEIQRD parameters and population metrics to optimize importation risk reduction while maintaining essential mobility."

    "notes": "Alabama has a moderate exposed (E=1306) and infected (I=385) population relative to its susceptible base (S=4,883,910), indicating a moderate infection pressure on South Carolina through inbound traffic. The expected imported infections can be approximated by imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population), where population is roughly the sum of all compartments. Given this, initial weeks with stricter controls (lower fractions) reduce early imported cases, benefiting the epidemic control in South Carolina. A strict-first pattern (heavier control in week 1, gradually relaxing) is chosen to delay and reduce initial case importation. This approach balances reducing transmission risk with gradually restoring mobility. The fractions sum to 1 exactly (0.40 + 0.30 + 0.20 + 0.10 = 1.00), validating a coherent traffic allocation."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound allocations prioritize stricter controls in the initial weeks (strict-first pattern) across all origin states with higher infection prevalences and inflows to South Carolina. This approach aims to minimize early imported infections, which have a high potential to seed local transmission chains, thereby reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in South Carolina. The formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population) guides this strategy by focusing on both infection prevalence and mobility volume. States with higher I/population ratios and/or higher inflows receive more stringent early restrictions, while those with lower risk are allowed relatively more relaxed flows. This coordinated cross-state traffic control balances epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs by gradually relaxing restrictions over the four-week horizon. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become even more critical to prevent surge in imported cases. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta reduces, some relaxation may be feasible earlier. The policy is robust to these variations due to its phased nature and risk-proportional allocation. The exact summation to unity of fractions ensures no net increase or decrease in total flow over the 4 weeks, maintaining fairness and logistical feasibility while optimizing timing to reduce epidemic impact."

The expected imported infections from Alabama scale roughly as Inflow * ft * (I / population). Given the high daily average inflow (16798.18), delaying and reducing traffic in earlier weeks is critical. Therefore, a strict-first pattern is chosen, with heavier restrictions in week 1 (0.35) and progressively relaxed control by week 4 (0.15). This allows containment of potential imported infections early on, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in South Carolina. The trade-off sacrifices some mobility initially but gains epidemic control later. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in South Carolina, the recommended traffic control policy applies stricter control earlier (strict-first pattern) for origin states with higher infection burdens (I) and higher inflows, such as Alabama, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, and Virginia. This frontloads epidemic control to reduce early imported infections, which can seed local outbreaks. Lower prevalence or lower inflow states receive even or relaxed-first patterns to balance mobility needs and economic activity. The total inbound flow per origin state remains constant over 4 weeks, but weekly fractions are adjusted to reduce risk during high prevalence periods. Cross-state coordination ensures that weeks with higher risks in one state coincide with stricter controls, balancing overall imported infection risk into South Carolina. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early restrictions would be warranted; conversely, if prevalence drops or vaccination coverage improves, traffic restrictions can be relaxed earlier. This approach balances epidemic control and mobility, aiming to reduce imported infections and deaths while maintaining essential travel and economic flows."

The imported infections are roughly proportional to the flow multiplied by the infectious proportion, i.e., imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/S). To reduce importation risk, a strict-first pattern is applied, with heavier restrictions in the first two weeks (fractions 0.30, 0.30), and somewhat relaxed later (0.20, 0.20). This pattern aligns with the infection pressure trend and allows for initial containment while gradually restoring mobility.

  "global_guidance": "The traffic control policy prioritizes reducing imported infections into South Carolina by adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions from each origin state. States with higher infected and exposed ratios relative to their susceptible populations receive stricter control earlier (strict-first pattern), front-loading traffic reductions to minimize early importation risk when prevalence is high. This minimizes cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by lowering seeding events. States with more stable or lower infection pressure adopt even allocations to balance epidemic control with mobility needs, avoiding unnecessary economic disruption. The total inbound flow from each origin is conserved over the 4 weeks to maintain essential connectivity and trade-offs. The allocation reflects quantitative cooperation by staggering restrictions across states and weeks, smoothing the burden and avoiding simultaneous peaks of imported infections. Sensitivity analysis shows that if prevalence increases, stricter fractions early on further reduce risk; conversely, if transmission rate beta decreases, more relaxed allocations suffice.

States with higher infected and exposed ratios relative to their susceptible populations receive stricter control earlier (strict-first pattern), front-loading traffic reductions to minimize early importation risk when prevalence is high. This minimizes cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by lowering seeding events. States with more stable or lower infection pressure adopt even allocations to balance epidemic control with mobility needs, avoiding unnecessary economic disruption. The total inbound flow from each origin is conserved over the 4 weeks to maintain essential connectivity and trade-offs. The allocation reflects quantitative cooperation by staggering restrictions across states and weeks, smoothing the burden and avoiding simultaneous peaks of imported infections. Sensitivity analysis shows that if prevalence increases, stricter fractions early on further reduce risk; conversely, if transmission rate beta decreases, more relaxed allocations suffice. This dynamic, data-driven approach balances epidemic control with mobility preservation across multiple states and weeks, ensuring the sum of fractions for each origin state equals exactly 1, fulfilling constraints and optimizing public health outcomes.'

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic control strategy for South Carolina carefully balances disease control and mobility needs by allocating inbound flows from each origin state over the next four weeks with a strict-first pattern for most states. This approach prioritizes reducing imported infections early—when the local epidemic is sensitive to new seeding—by lowering traffic fractions in the first two weeks and relaxing controls gradually in later weeks. The policy leverages infection pressure estimates from SEIQRD components: expected imported infected cases scale with inbound flow times infected proportion (I/population) times the weekly fraction. States with higher infected and exposed proportions and higher inflows (e.g., Ohio, Tennessee, Michigan) have stricter early restrictions to minimize early seeding of infections, thereby reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in South Carolina. States with lower infection risk or smaller inflows have moderately balanced allocations to maintain economic mobility while controlling risk. The fractions sum exactly to 1 for each origin state, ensuring total inbound flow remains consistent with ground truth data. This cooperation across states redistributes traffic temporally to flatten imported infection peaks across weeks, preventing overwhelming local health systems. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls would become more beneficial, while if prevalence decreases, allocations could be relaxed earlier. The approach also accounts for the trade-off between epidemic control and economic activity by gradually relaxing controls in later weeks as imported infection risk declines due to local control measures. Together, this policy forms a data-driven, adaptive traffic control plan that minimizes epidemic impact while preserving essential mobility."

The expected imported infections can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population), where population is roughly the sum of all compartments. Given Alabama's moderate infection prevalence, an even allocation pattern is chosen to maintain stable mobility while not overly increasing risk in any particular week. Each week's fraction is set to 0.25, summing exactly to 1, to evenly distribute inbound flow and avoid spikes in imported infections. This balances epidemic control and traffic flow, ensuring no single week faces excessive exposure risk. The total inbound flow over 4 weeks remains constant, meeting the ground truth."

To minimize risk, a strict-first pattern is used, where initial weeks enforce stricter control (lower fractions) and later weeks relax slightly. Here, f1 and f2 are set at 0.3 to curb early week inflow, reducing immediate imported infections, while f3 and f4 at 0.2 allow some relaxation as prevalence may decrease.

Conversely, states with lower infection pressure (Kentucky, Virginia) employ even distributions to maintain steady, manageable inflow. This cooperative strategy balances infection risk across weeks and origins, preventing overwhelming importation surges in any single period or from any single state. Quantitatively, expected imported infections approximate Flow * ft * (I/population), so controlling early weeks in high-risk states reduces cumulative infection seeding. The patterns are designed to smooth mobility restrictions, avoiding abrupt changes that could cause unintended travel surges or economic disruption. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter or more front-loaded restrictions would be necessary. Conversely, if prevalence drops or vaccination improves, patterns could be relaxed toward even distributions. This adaptive, state-specific allocation approach optimizes epidemic control in South Carolina, leveraging spatial heterogeneity in origin states' epidemic status and mobility baselines to minimize overall disease burden while preserving essential mobility."

The expected imported infections roughly scale with daily inflow times fraction times prevalence I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D). Since the inflow is high (10933 average daily) and infected proportion exists, a balanced even distribution approach is chosen to avoid spikes in any particular week. This approach minimizes risk while maintaining mobility. Strict front-loading could cause unnecessary mobility hardship, while relaxed first could risk early importation.

  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic control policy across origin states aims to minimize imported infections and deaths in South Carolina by strategically adjusting weekly traffic fractions while keeping total inflow constant. States with higher infected populations and/or higher inflow volumes (e.g., Ohio, Tennessee, Michigan, Indiana, Texas, Virginia) adopt a strict-first pattern, reducing inbound traffic in the first two weeks to mitigate early importation risk when infection pressure is highest. This delay helps slow epidemic spread and peak load on healthcare. Conversely, states with lower infected prevalence or lower inflow use an even pattern to maintain balanced mobility and risk control without causing abrupt economic disruptions. The fractions always sum to exactly 1.000 per state to ensure total flow preservation. This coordinated approach balances epidemic control and economic considerations by spreading out importation risk temporally and spatially. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early control could yield greater marginal benefits; if prevalence drops, more relaxed patterns may suffice. Overall, this cooperative allocation strategy leverages data-driven infection risk and mobility baselines to reduce cumulative cases and deaths in South Carolina effectively."

    "notes": "Alabama has a large susceptible population (4,791,788) with a relatively low number of infected individuals (884). The ratio I/S is low, indicating moderate infection prevalence. Imported infected cases can be estimated as Flow * ft * (I / population), where Flow is daily inbound traffic, ft is the weekly fraction, and I/population approximates the infection prevalence. Given the fairly stable infection rate and the moderately high inflow, a 'strict-first' pattern is chosen to reduce immediate importation risk by imposing stricter controls in weeks 1 and 2 (30% each), relaxing slightly in weeks 3 and 4 (20% each). This front-loading of restrictions aims to curb seeding of infection early on when local cases may be more vulnerable to importation. Trade-offs include a temporary reduction in mobility early on balanced with longer-term epidemic control benefits. The fractions sum to exactly 1 (0.30+0.30+0.20+0.20=1.00), validating the allocation."

The daily inbound flow is moderate (3003), so the imported infection risk is moderate. Since the infection prevalence is fairly stable and not rapidly increasing, an even distribution of fractions is appropriate to balance mobility and epidemic control. Using even fractions of 0.25 each week maintains consistent but moderate control, avoiding spikes in importation risk. The formula for imported infections remains Flow * ft * (I/population). This even pattern balances economic and social considerations with public health. The fractions sum to 1 (0.25*4=1), ensuring correctness."

This front-loading of control reduces the risk of imported cases triggering secondary transmission and deaths. States with moderate or low infection prevalence and lower inbound flows adopt even distributions to balance epidemic control with socioeconomic mobility. The quantitative cooperation logic leverages the multiplicative relationship of imported infections ~ Flow * ft * (I/population), distributing restrictions temporally to smooth imported infection risk and avoid overwhelming local healthcare.

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocations prioritize reducing flows from origin states with higher infection prevalence and large inbound volumes during the initial weeks, applying a 'strict-first' pattern to curb early importations into South Carolina. States such as Arkansas, Idaho, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Tennessee show higher infection prevalence and thus receive stricter traffic control earlier. States with stable or lower infection prevalence and moderate flows, such as Arizona, Iowa, Utah, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, are assigned an even pattern to balance control and mobility. This strategic distribution minimizes the cumulative imported infections and consequent confirmed and deceased cases in South Carolina by reducing the infection pressure when local control capabilities are most vulnerable. The quantitative cooperation logic ensures that the total inbound flow from each origin state remains constant over the four weeks (fractions sum to 1), maintaining socioeconomic stability while adjusting weekly proportions to manage epidemic risks temporally. By front-loading restrictions during the first two weeks, the approach leverages the incubation and infectious periods to reduce secondary transmissions. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence (I/population) or transmission rate beta increases, stricter initial controls or longer duration of restrictions may be warranted. Conversely, if local control measures improve or external infection risks decrease, more relaxed and even patterns could be adopted.

States such as Arkansas, Idaho, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Tennessee show higher infection prevalence and thus receive stricter traffic control earlier. States with stable or lower infection prevalence and moderate flows, such as Arizona, Iowa, Utah, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, are assigned an even pattern to balance control and mobility. This strategic distribution minimizes the cumulative imported infections and consequent confirmed and deceased cases in South Carolina by reducing the infection pressure when local control capabilities are most vulnerable. The quantitative cooperation logic ensures that the total inbound flow from each origin state remains constant over the four weeks (fractions sum to 1), maintaining socioeconomic stability while adjusting weekly proportions to manage epidemic risks temporally. By front-loading restrictions during the first two weeks, the approach leverages the incubation and infectious periods to reduce secondary transmissions. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence (I/population) or transmission rate beta increases, stricter initial controls or longer duration of restrictions may be warranted. Conversely, if local control measures improve or external infection risks decrease, more relaxed and even patterns could be adopted. The policy balances the trade-off between epidemic control and mobility, aiming to protect public health while preserving essential travel and economic activities."

The imported infected cases to South Carolina can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population), where population is total state population. Given Alabama's sizable daily average inflow (12930.5) to South Carolina and moderate infection rates, a strict-first pattern is recommended, applying stronger control in earlier weeks (lower fractions in weeks 1 and 2) to reduce early importation of cases. Trade-offs include balancing economic and social mobility with epidemic control; relaxing controls too early risks seeding new infections.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations collectively adopt a mix of strict-first and even patterns depending on each origin state's infection pressure and inflow volume, strategically reducing cumulative imported infections and deaths in South Carolina. States with higher infected or exposed proportions and larger inflow volumes (e.g., Alabama, Tennessee, Idaho) are assigned strict-first patterns, emphasizing early-week controls to limit initial seeding of infections. This front-loading of restrictive measures reduces the epidemic growth potential in South Carolina. Conversely, states with low infected proportions or smaller inflows (e.g., Iowa, Nebraska, Utah) have even allocations, balancing mobility and risk without unnecessary restrictions. The cooperation logic across states ensures that total imported infection pressure is smoothed over the 4-week horizon, avoiding surges that could overwhelm local control capacity. This temporal balancing leverages the infection risk formula, imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/population), to modulate risk by adjusting weekly fractions ft per state, respecting the constant total inflow constraint. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls (lower early fractions) would yield greater benefits by reducing imported infections when local susceptibility remains high. Conversely, if prevalence is low or beta decreases, relaxing controls can safely increase mobility. The policy thus adapts dynamically to epidemic severity and inter-state mobility patterns, prioritizing early containment to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in South Carolina while maintaining essential mobility and economic activity."
