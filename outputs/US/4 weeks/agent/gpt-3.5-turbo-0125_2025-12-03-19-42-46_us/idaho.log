The exposed (E=1,306) and confirmed (Q=14,562) are also significant but not extreme. The total population is large, so the fraction of infected is small. Expected imported infections can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / Population), which is low here. Given a relatively stable infection rate and no large upcoming peaks, an even distribution of traffic control (even pattern) is appropriate to balance epidemic control and mobility. This approach reduces sudden surges of risk while allowing steady, manageable inbound flow. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.25*4=1.0), meeting constraints."

  "global_guidance": "The overall traffic control recommendations prioritize reducing imported infections from origin states with higher infected and exposed proportions relative to their populations, especially those with large inbound flows to Idaho, such as Utah, Texas, Arizona, and South Carolina. By adopting relaxed-first patterns for such states, we impose stricter traffic controls in the initial weeks, thus minimizing early imported infections that could seed larger outbreaks in Idaho. For states with lower infection pressure or smaller inflows, even or strict-first patterns are used to maintain balanced mobility and epidemic control. The total inbound flow over 4 weeks remains constant for each origin state, ensuring consistency with ground truth data while allowing temporal redistribution of flow volumes. This cooperation logic balances risk across weeks by front-loading strict controls where prevalence and inflow are high, thereby flattening the imported infection curve and reducing cumulative cases and deaths in Idaho. Sensitivity to changes in disease transmissibility (beta) or prevalence suggests that if infection rates rise, stricter initial controls and longer durations of low fractions would be warranted. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta lowers, fractions could be more evenly distributed or relaxed earlier. The current strategy is robust to moderate fluctuations in these parameters, aiming to minimize epidemic spread while preserving essential mobility and economic activity. This multi-state coordinated policy leverages SEIQRD insights and mobility patterns to strategically allocate inbound traffic, ensuring that Idaho's epidemic burden is minimized through targeted, temporally adaptive controls."

  "global_guidance": "The overall inbound traffic control policy across origin states balances epidemic risk by allocating stricter controls early in weeks with higher infection pressure, especially from states with high infected and exposed counts or large inbound flows such as Utah, Texas, and Ohio. By employing strict-first patterns for these states, Idaho minimizes early importation of infected individuals when local susceptible population remains high, reducing cumulative cases and deaths. For origin states with lower infection prevalence and stable infection pressure, even traffic distribution is used to maintain consistent control without unnecessarily restricting mobility. Relaxed-first patterns are reserved for states with moderate infection levels and large populations to delay risk importation while allowing some mobility. The approach recognizes that imported infections scale approximately as Flow * ft * (I/pop), so adjusting ft dynamically balances risk. The total inbound flow remains constant over the 4 weeks for each state, ensuring no loss in total mobility but shifting temporal risk. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission parameters (beta) increase, stricter early controls may need intensification. Conversely, if prevalence declines or vaccinations improve, controls can be relaxed earlier. This cooperative cross-state allocation reduces peak imported cases in Idaho and allows better epidemic management while preserving essential mobility, crucial for economic and social functions."

    "notes": "Alabama has a large susceptible population with a relatively low number of infected individuals (I=457) compared to its total population (~4.86 million). The infected proportion is low, but given its large population, imported infections approximately scale as Flow*ft*(I/S+E+I+Q+R+D). Alabama's average daily inflow to Idaho is moderate (987.7). The traffic allocation follows a strict-first pattern, with more restrictions in the earlier weeks (f1=0.30, f2=0.25) to reduce immediate imported infections when Idaho's own infected count is moderate. Later weeks are relaxed progressively to balance mobility and economic activity. This pattern minimizes cumulative infections by front-loading stricter controls when risk is higher.

  "global_guidance": "In setting these inbound traffic allocation fractions, we collectively aim to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Idaho by managing the timing and intensity of imported infections from each origin state. States with high infected counts and/or extremely high inflows (e.g., Utah, Arizona, Texas) receive stricter early-week restrictions or a relaxed-first pattern to defer some mobility while Idaho's internal controls strengthen, effectively reducing early importation peaks. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflow volumes are assigned strict-first patterns with heavier restrictions upfront to cut early transmissions but allow relaxation later, balancing epidemic control and economic mobility. Even allocation patterns are assigned to states with moderate risk and inflow to simplify control measures and maintain steady mobility. This cross-state strategy balances infection pressure temporally and spatially, preventing simultaneous peaks in imported infections and allowing Idaho's healthcare system to manage caseloads effectively. Quantitatively, imported infections scale approximately as Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)), so lowering ft in weeks with higher incoming infected prevalence reduces infection importation. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if the infection transmission rate beta or prevalence in origin states increases, stricter early controls or extended strict phases would be necessary. Conversely, decreased prevalence or improved internal control in Idaho could allow more relaxed patterns. This coordinated policy ensures that total inbound flows over 4 weeks remain constant per origin state, preserving travel volume but optimizing temporal distribution to minimize epidemic impact."

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy balances infection risks from multiple origin states with Idaho's local epidemic status to minimize cumulative infections and deaths. High prevalence states such as Arizona, Ohio, Texas, Michigan, and Utah receive stricter early controls (lower fractions in initial weeks) to reduce early importation of infected individuals when Idaho remains vulnerable. Less risky states with lower infection prevalence have more even or relaxed-first patterns to preserve mobility and economic activity. This allocation maintains constant total flow from each origin but redistributes it weekly to reduce peak infection importation, leveraging temporal control to mitigate epidemic amplification. The cooperation across states ensures that no single high-risk origin is allowed to overwhelm Idaho's defenses suddenly. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls (lower initial fractions) become more critical, while if prevalence decreases, more relaxed patterns could be justified. Additionally, mobility baselines inform feasible adjustments without drastically impairing connectivity. This strategy thus optimizes epidemic control while balancing socio-economic needs, validated by the exact sum-to-one fraction constraints and epidemiological reasoning."

    "notes": "Alabama has a large susceptible population (4,834,378) and very low exposed (1,898) and infected (591) counts relative to its population, indicating relatively low infection pressure. The imported infected cases can be approximated by Flow * ft * (I / population), so with low infection prevalence, the risk from Alabama's inbound travelers remains low. Given the stable infection trend and low risk, an even pattern (equal fractions across the 4 weeks) is chosen to balance epidemic control without overly restricting mobility, especially since the flow magnitude is moderate (625 daily). This approach minimizes disruption while maintaining control. The fractions sum exactly to 1, confirming the allocation's validity."

The inbound flow from Arizona is substantial (8,243 daily), so imported infections could significantly affect Idaho's epidemic. Using the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population), frontloading strict controls in weeks 1 and 2 (fractions 0.10 and 0.15) reduces early imported infections, allowing Idaho's local epidemic to stabilize. Relaxing restrictions gradually in weeks 3 and 4 (0.30 and 0.45) accommodates mobility needs as infection pressure potentially declines. This strict-first pattern balances risk reduction and mobility restoration. The fractions sum to 1 exactly."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control allocations collectively aim to minimize imported infections into Idaho by prioritizing strict controls in weeks where infection pressure from origin states is highest. States with higher infection prevalence (e.g., Utah, Arizona, Texas, Michigan) receive stricter early restrictions (lower fractions in weeks 1 and 2) to reduce importation risk, while states with lower infection prevalence have more even or mildly strict-first patterns. This cross-state approach balances the overall risk by distributing strict control efforts where needed, reducing the cumulative imported infected cases that drive Idaho's epidemic dynamics. The total inbound flow per origin state remains constant, preserving overall mobility volume but adjusting timing to reduce peak importation risks. The sensitivity of these recommendations to changes in prevalence or transmission rate (beta) is important; if infection rates increase, stricter early controls would be warranted, while lower beta or prevalence would allow more relaxed patterns. The cooperation logic involves allocating stricter controls early to states posing higher risks and relaxing later to maintain economic and social mobility. This phased approach reduces cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Idaho by flattening incoming infection pressure, enabling better local epidemic control and healthcare capacity management."

The risk of importing infected individuals to Idaho is modeled as inflow*fraction*(I/population). Alabama's inflow to Idaho is moderate (597.5 daily average). We apply a strict-first pattern (lower fractions in early weeks) to reduce initial importation risk while gradually relaxing controls as Idaho's local epidemic evolves. This pattern controls the immediate infection pressure from Alabama, reducing cumulative cases and deaths. The trade-off involves slightly reduced mobility in early weeks balanced against improved epidemic control. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000, validating the allocation."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively minimize Idaho's cumulative confirmed cases and deaths, inbound traffic control policies across origin states must balance infection risk and economic mobility. States with high infection and exposed populations (e.g., Utah, Arizona, Ohio) and/or large inbound flows to Idaho receive stricter early controls (strict-first pattern), sharply reducing early importation risk when Idaho's local epidemic is vulnerable. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure and smaller flows (e.g., Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska) have even traffic allocations to maintain steady control while minimizing disruption. High-flow states with moderate infection (e.g., Texas) adopt relaxed-first patterns to balance economic needs and epidemic control. The imported infection risk is quantitatively proportional to flow fraction times infection prevalence (I/population). Allocating fractions that start low and increase later (strict-first) effectively reduce early seeding events that lead to exponential local growth, thereby lowering cumulative cases and deaths. The total inbound flow from each origin state remains constant over 4 weeks, preserving mobility volume but redistributing temporally to reduce risk peaks. This temporal balancing leverages cooperative risk management: reducing flow when infection pressure is highest and allowing relaxation when local risk diminishes, leading to better overall epidemic outcomes. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls yield larger benefits; if prevalence falls, relaxed controls can be safely implemented earlier. Overall, this coordinated multi-state traffic control strategy effectively mitigates imported infection risk while balancing mobility needs, thereby reducing Idaho's epidemic burden."

States with high infection and exposed populations (e.g., Utah, Arizona, Ohio) and/or large inbound flows to Idaho receive stricter early controls (strict-first pattern), sharply reducing early importation risk when Idaho's local epidemic is vulnerable. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure and smaller flows (e.g., Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska) have even traffic allocations to maintain steady control while minimizing disruption. High-flow states with moderate infection (e.g., Texas) adopt relaxed-first patterns to balance economic needs and epidemic control. The imported infection risk is quantitatively proportional to flow fraction times infection prevalence (I/population). Allocating fractions that start low and increase later (strict-first) effectively reduce early seeding events that lead to exponential local growth, thereby lowering cumulative cases and deaths. The total inbound flow from each origin state remains constant over 4 weeks, preserving mobility volume but redistributing temporally to reduce risk peaks. This temporal balancing leverages cooperative risk management: reducing flow when infection pressure is highest and allowing relaxation when local risk diminishes, leading to better overall epidemic outcomes. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls yield larger benefits; if prevalence falls, relaxed controls can be safely implemented earlier.

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the recommended traffic control policies adopt a predominantly strict-first pattern, reflecting the need to reduce early-week imported infections from states with varying epidemic pressures. States with higher infected and exposed counts relative to susceptible populations, such as Utah, Michigan, Arkansas, and Wisconsin, have more severe front-loaded restrictions to minimize seeding Idaho's epidemic early. States with lower infection pressures receive slightly more relaxed early restrictions but still maintain a front-loaded pattern to manage risk. This coordinated approach balances the trade-off between epidemic control and maintaining essential mobility. By concentrating restrictions in the early weeks when imported infections contribute most to seeding local outbreaks, Idaho can reduce cumulative confirmed and deceased cases more effectively. Quantitatively, imported infections scale approximately as Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)) for each origin state. Adjusting ft weekly while keeping total flow constant over 4 weeks ensures no net economic loss in mobility but redistributes risk temporally to periods where Idaho can better manage infections. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter front-loading would yield greater benefits. Conversely, if these parameters decrease, a more even distribution could be feasible. Overall, this policy leverages inter-state cooperation and temporal risk balancing to minimize Idaho's epidemic burden while permitting eventual mobility restoration."

The expected imported infections can be approximated as imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/Population), where Flow is the inbound flow and ft is the fraction for week t. Given the relatively stable infection pressure, an even pattern of traffic allocation is suitable to maintain consistent control with no abrupt changes that might cause social or economic disruptions.

  "global_guidance": "To collectively minimize imported infections and subsequent confirmed and deceased cases in Idaho, we coordinated traffic control policies across all origin states by balancing strict initial restrictions with gradual relaxation over the 4 weeks. States with higher infection prevalence and exposure (e.g., Utah, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin) received stricter early controls (low fractions in week 1), significantly reducing immediate infectious inflow. Conversely, states with lower prevalence (Kentucky, Alabama) maintained even or slightly relaxed patterns to preserve essential mobility. This cooperative allocation balances the risk of importing infections weighted by each state's infectious population relative to its susceptible population and their inbound flow volumes. Quantitatively, imported infections approximate Flow*ft*(I/Population), so decreasing ft in early weeks for high-risk states reduces the total imported infections early on, which is critical to preventing exponential growth within Idaho. The model assumes relatively stable epidemiological parameters (beta, alpha, gamma, mu, delta) and population compositions during the 4 weeks. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls or longer durations of low fractions would be necessary to maintain control. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, controls can be relaxed sooner to support mobility. This staged and coordinated approach distributes epidemic control burden across origin states and time, avoiding sudden shocks while effectively minimizing cumulative infections and deaths in Idaho."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Idaho, inbound traffic control policies are coordinated across all origin states based on infection prevalence and flow volume. States with high infected and exposed counts, such as South Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Utah, receive stricter early-week traffic reductions (strict-first pattern) to prevent early seeding of infections in Idaho. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or more stable trajectories (e.g., Arizona, Michigan, Texas) use even distributions to maintain consistent control without excessive mobility disruption. Relaxed-first patterns for some states with lower immediate infection pressure but potential mid-term risk (Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota, Wisconsin) allow some early mobility balanced with later tightening to prevent surges. This cross-state balancing reduces overall imported infections by preventing simultaneous peaks from multiple origins, thus flattening Idaho's epidemic curve. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections are proportional to Flow * fraction * (I/population). By adjusting fractions to lower values in weeks with higher infection prevalence or flow, total imported infections are minimized while preserving total inbound volume over the month. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if transmission rate beta or prevalence increases, stricter front-loading of traffic control would be more beneficial, while lower beta or prevalence would allow more balanced or relaxed patterns. This dynamic allocation approach balances epidemic control and mobility, limiting imported infection risk while sustaining economic and social connectivity."

The exposed (E=1501) and infected (I=466) indicate some ongoing transmission risk. The imported infected cases can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population), where population is roughly sum of compartments. Given Alabama's moderate infection prevalence, we choose an even pattern to maintain balanced traffic control, neither too strict nor too relaxed at any week. This avoids sudden surges or dips in infection risk importation. The trade-off prioritizes epidemic control while allowing stable mobility to minimize economic disruption. The fractions sum to exactly 1.0000, validating the distribution."

Consequently, a strict-first pattern is chosen to reduce inbound flow in the initial week (f1=0.15) and gradually relax controls in later weeks (f3 and f4 both 0.30).

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the recommended traffic control policy across origin states balances epidemic control with mobility preservation by adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions based on infection prevalence and traffic volume. States with higher infected and exposed populations, such as Utah, Michigan, and South Carolina, adopt strict-first patterns with lower flow fractions in early weeks to reduce imported infection pressure in Idaho when local conditions are vulnerable. Lower risk states employ more even or slightly strict-first patterns to maintain steady but controlled mobility. The total inbound flow from each state remains constant over four weeks, ensuring no net economic disruption from volume changes but optimizing timing to minimize disease spread. Quantitatively, imported infections approximate Flow * ft * (I / population), so reducing ft in weeks with high infection prevalence or critical epidemic conditions lowers expected imported cases. This cooperation across states and weeks creates a temporal risk balancing, smoothing infection importation and preventing healthcare overload. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission parameters (beta) increase, stricter early controls or extended duration of restrictions would be needed. Conversely, decreasing prevalence or effective local control in Idaho could allow earlier relaxation of inbound controls. This policy framework is adaptive, evidence-based, and designed to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Idaho while sustaining essential mobility."

  "global_guidance": "The overall traffic control policy aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Idaho by modulating the weekly inbound flow fractions from all origin states, keeping total flow constant per origin. States with higher infection and exposed prevalence, such as Michigan, Ohio, Texas, and Tennessee, are assigned stricter controls in the initial weeks (lower flow fractions early) to reduce immediate importation risk and allow Idaho to manage local spread. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or more stable epidemic situations adopt relaxed-first or balanced patterns to maintain economic activity while applying stricter measures if conditions worsen. The strategy collectively balances epidemic control and mobility needs by spreading imported infection risk over time and space, avoiding overwhelming Idaho's healthcare capacity. The fractions sum to exactly 1 for each state, validating flow conservation. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls would be even more critical to prevent surge. Conversely, if prevalence decreases rapidly, relaxing controls earlier could accelerate economic recovery without compromising health.

States with higher infection and exposed prevalence, such as Michigan, Ohio, Texas, and Tennessee, are assigned stricter controls in the initial weeks (lower flow fractions early) to reduce immediate importation risk and allow Idaho to manage local spread. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or more stable epidemic situations adopt relaxed-first or balanced patterns to maintain economic activity while applying stricter measures if conditions worsen. The strategy collectively balances epidemic control and mobility needs by spreading imported infection risk over time and space, avoiding overwhelming Idaho's healthcare capacity. The fractions sum to exactly 1 for each state, validating flow conservation. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls would be even more critical to prevent surge. Conversely, if prevalence decreases rapidly, relaxing controls earlier could accelerate economic recovery without compromising health. This cooperative and adaptive approach across multiple origin states leverages their epidemic heterogeneity to strategically allocate inbound traffic, minimizing Idaho's cumulative epidemic burden while sustaining essential mobility."

The key principle is that expected imported infections scale with Flow * fraction_ft * (I / population) of each origin state. States with higher infected and exposed populations, or those with very large flows into Idaho (e.g., Utah, Texas, Arizona), are assigned stricter control earlier (strict-first pattern) to reduce early seeding of infections and enable Idaho's health system to manage cases effectively. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or smaller flows adopt even or relaxed-first patterns to maintain necessary mobility while controlling risk. This cross-state cooperation balances epidemic control and economic needs by distributing restrictions over time and across states, avoiding overwhelming Idaho's capacity or causing large-scale mobility disruption simultaneously. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter front-loading of controls becomes more critical to prevent exponential growth of cases. Conversely, if prevalence falls or beta reduces due to vaccination or mitigation, more relaxed patterns could be considered. Overall, this policy aims to keep the total inbound flow constant while redistributing weekly proportions to minimize epidemic impact, validated by fractions summing to exactly 1 per state. This harmonized approach supports Idaho's epidemic resilience and economic stability."

We adopt a relaxed-first pattern, increasing flow in weeks 3 and 4 to allow economic mobility while initially restricting travel to reduce early imported cases. Trade-offs balance epidemic control with mobility needs, ensuring that total flow is preserved. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic policies balance the total flow over 4 weeks to preserve economic activity while strategically adjusting weekly fractions to reduce imported infections and deaths in Idaho. States with high infection prevalence and large flows, such as Utah and Arizona, receive stricter control early (lower fractions in initial weeks) to curb early seeding of infections into Idaho, leveraging a strict-first pattern. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or smaller flows adopt relaxed-first or even distribution patterns to maintain mobility without significantly increasing epidemic risk. The traffic control approach uses the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population) to estimate risk per origin state and week. By reducing ft in weeks with higher infection pressure or when early containment is critical, the policy minimizes cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Idaho. The fractions sum exactly to 1 for each state, ensuring total inbound flow remains unchanged. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls should be emphasized more strongly, especially for high-flow states. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed patterns can be applied to support economic recovery. This coordinated approach across origin states and weeks balances epidemic control and mobility, reducing overall disease burden in Idaho while preserving essential travel and commerce."

Given the low infectious pressure, an even distribution of traffic inflow across the 4 weeks is chosen to maintain mobility and economic activity without significantly increasing risk. The formula for imported infected is roughly Flow*ft*(I/population), so even spacing balances risk and flow. This approach avoids spikes in imported infections that could occur if traffic was relaxed early. The trade-off is maintaining steady inflow while keeping imported infections stable.

Conversely, states with low infection prevalence and/or low flow (e.g., Alabama, Mississippi) adopt even distribution to maintain mobility without compromising safety. The strict-first pattern balances epidemic control and economic activity, imposing early restrictions then relaxing as Idaho's internal epidemic stabilizes. A key sensitivity is infection prevalence estimates; if prevalence or transmission (beta) increase, stricter or longer restrictions may be needed. Conversely, if prevalence falls, controls can relax earlier.

The imported infected individuals per week can be approximated as imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population), where population ~ sum of compartments (~4,827,000). Given the relatively low infection prevalence (I/population ~0.018%), a strict-first traffic pattern is recommended to initially reduce the volume, particularly in week 1 (fraction 0.35) and week 2 (0.30), then relaxing over weeks 3 and 4 to balance mobility and control. This approach minimizes early imported infections when Idaho's infected count is still significant (6,354). The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.35 + 0.30 + 0.20 + 0.15 = 1.00). Trade-offs include temporary mobility reduction from Alabama but better epidemic control for Idaho."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic control policy for Idaho balances epidemic control and mobility by adjusting weekly traffic fractions per origin state based on their infection prevalence and baseline inflow. States with higher infection prevalence and/or large inflow volumes, such as Utah, Arkansas, and South Carolina, receive stricter controls earlier (strict-first pattern), reducing early imported infections when Idaho's own infected population is still significant. This reduces cumulative cases and deaths in Idaho. States with moderate infection prevalence and large populations but moderate infection pressure, such as Arizona and Texas, follow even traffic patterns to maintain steady control and mobility. The total inflow over 4 weeks per state remains constant, preserving overall economic activity but redistributing flows to minimize peak importation risk. Quantitatively, imported infections scale approximately by Flow * ft * (I/population), so reducing ft in early weeks from higher-risk states lowers initial imported infections, crucial when Idaho's susceptible population is large and infected is non-negligible. The cooperation across states and weeks ensures that no single week or state causes a surge in imported cases, smoothing epidemic pressure on Idaho. Sensitivity analyses show if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase in origin states, stricter early controls would be warranted; conversely, if prevalence falls, controls can be relaxed earlier. This flexible, data-driven approach optimizes epidemic outcomes while preserving mobility as much as possible."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Idaho, the traffic control policy balances infection risk from each origin state's epidemic status with the need to maintain economic mobility. States with high infection and exposed numbers, such as Utah, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Wisconsin, have stricter early controls (lower fractions in early weeks) to reduce imported infections when risk is highest. This strict-first pattern limits initial influx of infected individuals and helps flatten the epidemic curve in Idaho. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or larger populations but moderate infections, like Alabama, Kentucky, and Virginia, are assigned even or relaxed-first patterns to sustain mobility without significantly increasing risk. The total inbound flow from each state remains constant over the four weeks, but weekly proportions shift to concentrate restrictions when importation risk is greatest. This temporal redistribution leverages incubation periods (delta) and recovery rates (gamma) to time restrictions effectively. Quantitative cooperation across states ensures that high-risk origins reduce flows early, while others maintain steadier traffic, balancing overall imported infection pressure. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence rises or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more critical, potentially extending low fractions across multiple weeks to prevent seeding outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence declines or immunity increases, traffic can be relaxed earlier to support economic recovery. The chosen fractions sum exactly to 1 for each state, validating compliance with constraints.

States with high infection and exposed numbers, such as Utah, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Wisconsin, have stricter early controls (lower fractions in early weeks) to reduce imported infections when risk is highest. This strict-first pattern limits initial influx of infected individuals and helps flatten the epidemic curve in Idaho. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or larger populations but moderate infections, like Alabama, Kentucky, and Virginia, are assigned even or relaxed-first patterns to sustain mobility without significantly increasing risk. The total inbound flow from each state remains constant over the four weeks, but weekly proportions shift to concentrate restrictions when importation risk is greatest. This temporal redistribution leverages incubation periods (delta) and recovery rates (gamma) to time restrictions effectively. Quantitative cooperation across states ensures that high-risk origins reduce flows early, while others maintain steadier traffic, balancing overall imported infection pressure. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence rises or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more critical, potentially extending low fractions across multiple weeks to prevent seeding outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence declines or immunity increases, traffic can be relaxed earlier to support economic recovery. The chosen fractions sum exactly to 1 for each state, validating compliance with constraints. Overall, this coordinated policy optimizes epidemic control and mobility by strategically timing inbound flows based on evolving infection risks across the regional network."

  "global_guidance": "The traffic control policy across all origin states for Idaho aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically allocating weekly inbound flow fractions while keeping total flow constant. Infection pressures vary widely across states, with some like South Carolina, Tennessee, and Utah showing very high infected and exposed counts, whereas others like Nebraska and Kentucky have lower infection prevalence. The policy applies stricter traffic control (lower fractions) in early weeks for high-risk states to reduce early importation of infected individuals, which can seed outbreaks in Idaho. Conversely, states with steady or lower infection rates receive more balanced or relaxed distributions to maintain essential mobility and economic activity. The relaxation in later weeks (week 3 or 4) assumes possible infection control improvements or immunity build-up, reducing risk of importation. Quantitatively, imported infected cases roughly scale as Flow*ft*(I/population), so adjusting ft dynamically across weeks modulates infection importation risk without changing total traffic volume. This coordination balances risk among states and weeks, avoiding simultaneous high importation from multiple states that could overwhelm Idaho's control measures. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta rises, more aggressive early restrictions (lower initial fractions) would be warranted to prevent rapid outbreak growth. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or control measures improve, fractions could be more evenly distributed or relaxed earlier to support mobility. Overall, this dynamic, state-specific inbound traffic allocation strategy aims to reduce Idaho's epidemic burden while balancing societal mobility needs."

The expected imported infected cases scale approximately as Flow*ft*(I/Population), so the risk from Alabama is relatively low. Given stable infection levels and moderate inflow (average daily inflow ~836), an even allocation (equal fractions of 0.25 weekly) is chosen to maintain balanced mobility and control.

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy for Idaho's inbound traffic from all origin states balances epidemic risk reduction and mobility needs by adjusting weekly traffic fractions while keeping total 4-week flow constant per origin state. States with high infection prevalence (I) and/or very high inflow volumes, such as Utah, Texas, Michigan, Arizona, and South Carolina, have stricter early week controls (lower fractions in weeks 1 and 2) to minimize the initial imported infectious pressure into Idaho, which directly reduces the number of new exposed and infected cases locally. This is critical as early suppression prevents exponential growth in Idaho's susceptible and exposed populations. Gradual relaxation in weeks 3 and 4 (higher fractions) allows mobility and economic activities to recover, reducing social and economic costs. For states with low infection prevalence or smaller inflow, even allocations are sufficient to maintain mobility without significantly increasing epidemic risk. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/Population) for each origin state; front-loading stricter controls in weeks with higher infectious pressure reduces cumulative exposure. Coordinated timing across states reduces simultaneous high-risk inflows, smoothing the epidemic curve in Idaho. Sensitivity analysis suggests if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, early week fractions should be further reduced to maintain control, while if prevalence drops, fractions could be more evenly distributed. This dynamic allocation helps Idaho optimally manage imported infection risk while sustaining necessary mobility."
