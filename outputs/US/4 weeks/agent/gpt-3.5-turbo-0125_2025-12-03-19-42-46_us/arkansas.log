The imported infected from Alabama into Arkansas is roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)). Given the steady infection levels and large inflow, an even pattern is chosen to spread traffic control evenly over 4 weeks, balancing economic activity and epidemic control. This avoids spikes of imported infections in any one week. Trade-offs include maintaining mobility for economic reasons while limiting peak transmission risk.

  "global_guidance": "The traffic control policies across origin states are designed to collectively minimize imported infections and deaths in Arkansas by strategically allocating the same total inbound flow over the next 4 weeks with variable weekly fractions. States with high infection prevalence and/or large inbound flow (e.g., Oklahoma, Texas, Tennessee, Mississippi) are assigned strict-first patterns with lower fractions early to sharply reduce initial imported infections, which are roughly proportional to Flow * ft * (I / population). This front-loading control in high-risk states mitigates early seeding of cases in Arkansas. States with moderate or low prevalence and flow often receive even or relaxed-first patterns to maintain economic activity while balancing risk. This cooperative balancing across states reduces peak load on Arkansas's healthcare and lowers cumulative cases and deaths. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become even more critical to prevent exponential growth of imported cases. Conversely, if prevalence falls or vaccination improves, policies can relax sooner. The combined approach allows Arkansas to optimally distribute inbound traffic temporally and spatially, reducing overall epidemic burden while preserving essential mobility and economic functions."

  "global_guidance": "The traffic control policy for Arkansas strategically distributes inbound traffic fractions over the next four weeks for each origin state to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. States with higher infection prevalence (e.g., Idaho, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee) are assigned stricter control in early weeks (strict-first pattern), reducing immediate importation risk when infection pressure is high. States with moderate or controlled infection levels (e.g., Alabama, Iowa, Nebraska) follow even patterns to maintain balanced control and mobility. For states with active quarantine and moderate infections (e.g., Arizona, Kentucky, Virginia), relaxed-first patterns are applied to initially limit risk while progressively easing controls to support economic and social activities.\n\nThis coordinated approach balances epidemic control and mobility by allocating inbound traffic to minimize imported infections proportional to each state's infected fraction (Flow * ft * I/Population). Early strict control reduces immediate importation risk, while gradual relaxation avoids prolonged economic disruption. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter front-loading of control would be more beneficial. Conversely, if prevalence drops, more uniform or relaxed-first patterns could be adopted to restore mobility faster. The sum of weekly fractions for each state is rigorously maintained at 1 to preserve total flow integrity. Overall, this policy optimally balances risks and socio-economic needs across states and weeks."

The imported infected cases approximately scale as Flow * ft * (I/population), where Flow is average inbound flow and ft is the weekly fraction. Given the low infection pressure and stable SEIQRD numbers, an even traffic allocation pattern is chosen, maintaining consistent mobility and control to avoid sudden spikes.

  "global_guidance": "Balancing inbound traffic allocations across states aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Arkansas by managing imported infection risks and preserving essential mobility. States with high infection prevalence and/or very large inflow (e.g., Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Michigan) receive strict-first patterns with low flow initially to sharply reduce early imported infections when epidemic pressure is highest. This reduces seeding of new cases in Arkansas and lowers subsequent spread. States with low infection prevalence and moderate flow (e.g., Alabama, Iowa, Nebraska) adopt even patterns to maintain steady mobility without risking spikes. Moderate-risk states use relaxed-first patterns to allow some mobility early while tightening later, balancing economic and health priorities. The total flow from each state remains constant, but weekly fractions adjust timing to flatten infection importation peaks. This collective strategy distributes epidemic risk over time and space, preventing overwhelming Arkansas's health system. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase in origin states, stricter early restrictions become more valuable. Conversely, lower prevalence permits more even or relaxed patterns. The approach is adaptive and scalable, prioritizing early control of high-risk inflows and gradual relaxation to optimize health outcomes and economic activity. All fraction vectors sum exactly to 1, preserving total inbound flow volumes as required."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce imported infections and deaths in Arkansas, the traffic control policy emphasizes front-loading stricter controls (strict-first patterns) for origin states with high infection prevalence and/or very high inflows, such as Oklahoma, Texas, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Alabama. This reduces early imported infections when the seeding effect is most critical. States with moderate infection prevalence and inflows generally adopt even or relaxed-first patterns to balance epidemic control with mobility. The rationale is that imported infections approximate Flow*ft*(I/Population), so reducing ft in early weeks for high-risk states minimizes cumulative infections. Cooperation across states is achieved by distributing stricter controls in a way that does not overly restrict mobility from lower-risk states, maintaining essential economic activity and social connectivity. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases in any origin state, the strict-first approach gains importance to mitigate higher importation risk. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed patterns can be safely adopted to enhance mobility. This dynamic allocation across weeks and states ensures that the total inbound flow remains constant while strategically timing restrictions to minimize epidemic impact. The policy balances epidemic control and mobility by staggering restrictions and avoiding uniform severe controls, which could be economically damaging and socially unsustainable. Ensuring the fractions sum to exactly 1 for each state validates that flow is conserved and policies are implementable. Overall, this approach minimizes cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Arkansas by reducing imported infection seeding and enabling gradual adaptation to changing epidemic conditions."

The imported infection risk is proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population). With a daily inflow of ~9515, we distribute traffic to minimize peak importation: implementing a relaxed-first pattern by easing flow in later weeks (f3=0.30) when local Arkansas infections may be better controlled, and stricter controls initially (f1=0.20) to reduce early imported cases.

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arkansas, inbound traffic control from all origin states is coordinated with a relaxed-first pattern predominating. This pattern applies stricter controls in the initial weeks (lower fractions in week 1 and 2), reducing early imported infections while allowing gradual relaxation in later weeks (higher fractions in weeks 3 and 4). The imported infection risk is proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), so states with higher infection prevalence (I/population) and large inflows receive stricter early restrictions to prevent seeding outbreaks in Arkansas. Conversely, states with low infection prevalence or small inflows have relatively balanced or slightly relaxed patterns to maintain economic activity. This cross-state coordination balances epidemic control with mobility, preventing overwhelming local healthcare while supporting economic needs. The total inflow over 4 weeks remains constant per origin state, preserving long-term mobility volumes but reshaping temporal distribution to reduce early epidemic pressure. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early restrictions would be required to maintain control. Conversely, lower prevalence or reduced transmission could allow more uniform or relaxed allocations. This cooperative, risk-informed approach optimizes the timing of inbound flows, decreasing cumulative infections and deaths in Arkansas while sustaining essential travel and trade."

  "global_guidance": "This policy collectively aims to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Arkansas by adjusting weekly inbound traffic fractions per origin state to mitigate infection importation risks. States with higher infection prevalence (high I and E relative to population) and/or larger inbound flows such as Texas, Oklahoma, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, and Alabama have stricter early-week controls (strict-first pattern) to sharply reduce initial seeding risks. This front-loading of restrictions leverages the fact that imported infections roughly scale with Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing ft early in the period for high-risk origins sharply decreases early imported infections and downstream epidemic growth. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or smaller flows adopt more even or relaxed-first patterns, balancing epidemic control with mobility needs and economic considerations. The cooperation logic involves spreading imported infection risk temporally and geographically to avoid peaks that could overwhelm local containment. Weekly fractions sum to exactly 1 for each origin, ensuring total traffic volume remains constant but redistributed over time. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence rises or transmission rates increase (beta), the strict-first policies become more critical to limit early seeding, while with lower prevalence more relaxed or even patterns suffice. This adaptive, evidence-based balancing of mobility and epidemic control supports minimizing Arkansas's epidemic burden while maintaining essential traffic flows."

The importation risk is proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), where population is total state population. Given a low infected ratio (882/approx. 4.8M), risk is moderate. The inbound flow is substantial (6919 daily average). We choose a strict-first pattern, allocating lower fractions in the initial weeks to reduce early imported infections and allow Arkansas time to manage cases. Later weeks are slightly relaxed as infections may decline or control measures improve. The trade-off favors epidemic control early to prevent case surges, balanced with mobility needs later.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies for Arkansas inbound travel from various origin states are designed to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically adjusting weekly traffic fractions while keeping total 4-week inflow constant. States with higher infection prevalence (I/population) and/or large inbound flows receive stricter initial control (lower fraction in early weeks) to reduce the early importation of infectious individuals, thus allowing Arkansas's healthcare system and contact tracing to manage the influx better. States with moderate or low infection pressure and lower flows are assigned even or slightly relaxed-first patterns to balance epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs. Collectively, this cross-state strategy reduces the overall imported infection pressure by flattening peaks of inbound infected travelers, spreading risk more evenly over time.

Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase in origin states, stricter early controls become more critical to prevent surge importations; conversely, if these parameters fall, mobility can be relaxed sooner. The cooperation logic ensures that no single state disproportionately contributes to early importation risk, distributing control measures effectively. This strategic allocation of weekly fractions per origin state optimizes the trade-off between epidemic control and mobility, aiming to minimize Arkansas's disease burden over the next month."

States with higher infection prevalence (I/population) and/or large inbound flows receive stricter initial control (lower fraction in early weeks) to reduce the early importation of infectious individuals, thus allowing Arkansas's healthcare system and contact tracing to manage the influx better. States with moderate or low infection pressure and lower flows are assigned even or slightly relaxed-first patterns to balance epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs. Collectively, this cross-state strategy reduces the overall imported infection pressure by flattening peaks of inbound infected travelers, spreading risk more evenly over time.

The exposed (E=3523) and infected (I=1087) fractions are low, suggesting moderate risk of importing infections. Expected imported infections depend on the formula: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / (S+E+I+Q+R+D)). Given the moderate infection pressure and fairly stable recent inflow, an even pattern (equal fractions) is chosen to balance epidemic control and mobility needs. Strict-first or relaxed-first would be less justifiable given steady infection rates. Traffic control is uniform across weeks to minimize disruption and maintain constant economic activity. The fractions sum to exactly 1 (0.25+0.25+0.25+0.25=1). This approach mitigates peaks in imported infections and avoids excessive restrictions that could harm mobility."

Using imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / total_pop), front-loading stricter controls reduces early imported infections. Hence, a strict-first pattern is selected, with lower fractions in the first two weeks (0.20 each) and relaxed controls later (0.30 each). This approach attempts to reduce initial seeding of infections in Arkansas while allowing gradual reopening. Trade-offs include short-term mobility restrictions balanced against longer-term epidemic control. The fractions sum precisely to 1 (0.20+0.20+0.30+0.30=1). This pattern aligns with Arizona's infection trends, minimizing cumulative cases imported."

The formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / total_pop) suggests stricter controls are warranted early to prevent seeding. Thus, a strict-first pattern is adopted with the lowest fraction in week 1 (0.15), gradually relaxing afterwards. This helps contain initial importation risk, with increased flow allowed as prevalence hopefully declines or control measures improve. Trade-offs favor epidemic control over mobility early on, balancing public health with economic impact. Fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.15+0.25+0.30+0.30=1). This staggered approach is justified given Idaho's high infection pressure."

Expected imported infections scale as Flow * ft * (I / total_pop). A mildly strict-first pattern is chosen to reduce initial importation risk, with increasing fractions over time (22%, 23%, 27%, 28%). This balances epidemic control by curbing early exposure while progressively relaxing restrictions to support mobility. Trade-offs involve short-term strictness offset by longer-term mobility gains.

Fractions increase gradually across weeks, reflecting cautious relaxation. Trade-offs include balancing epidemic control early with improved mobility later.

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce expected imported infections and deaths in Arkansas, inbound traffic allocations from all origin states are modulated based on their respective infection pressures (quantified by infected I and exposed E fractions relative to total population) and average daily inbound flows. States with higher infection prevalence (e.g., Idaho, Utah, Michigan, Oklahoma) are subject to stricter early controls (low fractions in initial weeks) to minimize immediate seeding of infections, following a strict-first pattern. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or more stable trends (e.g., Alabama, Nebraska, South Carolina) employ an even traffic allocation pattern to balance epidemic control with consistent mobility. The quantitative cooperation logic ensures that total inbound flow per state over 4 weeks remains constant but redistributes weekly fractions to minimize the cumulative infected travelers. This temporal balancing reduces peak importation risk and allows gradual reopening as infection trends improve, leveraging the incubation and infectious periods. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls would be more beneficial to dampen importations. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta is lower, traffic can be more evenly distributed or relaxed earlier. The chosen patterns reflect a trade-off between public health safety and economic mobility, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Arkansas by reducing imported infections while maintaining practical inbound flow constraints and social-economic considerations."

    "notes": "Alabama has a large susceptible population (4,883,910) with relatively low infected (385) compared to its population, but a high number of confirmed cases (14,562), indicating controlled but existing infections. The imported infections can be estimated as Flow*ft*(I/Population). Given that the flow is large (14877 daily average) and infection prevalence moderate, a strict-first pattern is chosen to mitigate early importation risks while allowing some relaxation later as the local Arkansas epidemic evolves. Early strict control helps reduce imported infectious cases, especially given Alabama's sizable inflow contributing to Arkansas' epidemic. The trade-off accepts some mobility restriction in the first two weeks for better epidemic control, then gradually relaxes to balance economic activity. The fractions sum precisely to 1."

    "notes": "Arizona shows moderate exposed (1,666) and infected (494) populations relative to its susceptible count (7,247,763), with high confirmed cases (29,842). The daily inflow is about 2,748, smaller than Alabama but still significant. Given the infection prevalence and stable inflow, an even distribution pattern is chosen to keep consistent control and avoid sudden surges in imported infections. The imported infected cases roughly follow Flow*ft*(I/Population). Even traffic control balances epidemic mitigation and mobility, reducing risk steadily over four weeks. This approach avoids peaks in influx of infected individuals, minimizing case spikes. The fractions sum exactly to 1."

    "notes": "Idaho presents relatively high infection prevalence with I=2,079 out of a population of ~1.77 million, which is a considerable proportion. The inbound flow is low (573 daily average), but the infection pressure is significant. A strict-first pattern is adopted with strong early restrictions (high control in week 1 and 2) to prevent importing infections into Arkansas. Imported infections roughly equal Flow*ft*(I/Population). Early suppression is critical given Idaho's high infected ratio, then gradually relaxing traffic as risk diminishes or local Arkansas control improves. This balances reducing imported infections with maintaining some mobility over time. The fractions sum to 1 exactly."

Given moderate infection pressure and significant mobility, a slight strict-first pattern is chosen. Early weeks have tighter controls to curb imported infections approximated by Flow*ft*(I/Population). Gradual relaxation allows balancing epidemic control and economic needs. This approach minimizes cumulative cases by reducing early seeding of infections while not overly restricting later mobility. The fractions sum exactly to 1."

With low infection prevalence and moderate flow, an even pattern is justified to maintain steady control without excessive restrictions. Imported infections are low, estimated by Flow*ft*(I/Population), and even distribution avoids disruption while controlling risk. This balances epidemic mitigation and mobility evenly.

A strict-first traffic control pattern is selected to reduce early import risk into Arkansas, where imported infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/Population). This reduces initial seeding and allows relaxation in later weeks balancing control and mobility. Early strictness is vital to limit spread from any undetected infections.

Infection risk is notable due to large flow and exposed individuals. A strict-first pattern is chosen to strongly reduce early imported infections (imported infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/Population)) when risk is highest, then relaxing controls later.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations collectively aim to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Arkansas by strategically managing the timing and intensity of mobility restrictions based on infection prevalence and inflow volume from each origin state. States with high infection prevalence and/or large mobility inflows, such as Oklahoma, Texas, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Alabama, are assigned a strict-first pattern, imposing stronger restrictions in the initial weeks to reduce early seeding of infections into Arkansas. This early suppression aligns with the epidemic control objective to lower imported infectious individuals, thereby curbing secondary local transmission and deaths. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflows adopt either slight strict-first or even patterns to maintain a balance between control and economic activity, avoiding undue disruption while still mitigating risk. The cooperation logic across states and weeks is to distribute risk temporally and spatially; early weeks have stricter controls on high-risk origins, while later weeks allow gradual relaxation as local epidemic conditions potentially improve and imported cases diminish. This temporal balancing reduces peak importation risk and distributes mobility allowances to prevent economic shock. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases in origin states, stricter and earlier restrictions become more crucial to prevent overwhelming Arkansas' health system. Conversely, if local Arkansas recovery rates (gamma) or control measures improve, a more relaxed allocation could be justified, allowing higher mobility fractions without significantly increasing epidemic burden. Overall, this policy leverages detailed SEIQRD data and inflow volumes to optimize traffic control, minimizing imported infections and deaths through targeted temporal and spatial restrictions while balancing mobility needs."

  "global_guidance": "The traffic control strategy for Arkansas prioritizes minimizing imported infections and deaths by allocating inbound flows from origin states based on their epidemic risk profiles and daily inflow volumes. States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to their susceptible base, especially those with high daily inflows into Arkansas, receive stricter traffic controls in the initial weeks to reduce immediate importation risk. This approach employs predominantly relaxed-first patterns, starting with lower fractions to suppress early risk and gradually increasing traffic allowances to support economic and social mobility as epidemic pressures potentially decrease or stabilize. For origin states with exceptionally high inflow volumes, such as Oklahoma, Alabama, Texas, and Tennessee, the approach balances the necessity of maintaining economic activity with epidemic control by smoothing traffic through even or cautious relaxed-first patterns to prevent sudden spikes in imported cases. Quantitative cooperation logic is applied by ensuring that the sum of fractions over four weeks equals exactly one for each state, maintaining total flow constant while redistributing weekly proportions to minimize cumulative case and death counts in Arkansas. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early week controls would be warranted, further suppressing imported infections. Conversely, improved epidemic conditions could allow more relaxed early allocations. This coordinated allocation across states leverages the interplay of infection pressure and mobility to achieve epidemic control while mitigating severe economic disruption, reflecting a balanced, data-driven policy design."

Given the moderate infection levels, the risk of importing infected individuals is moderate and fairly stable over time. The expected imported infections can be approximated as inbound Flow multiplied by the fraction ft and the ratio of infected to total population, i.e., imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / (S + E + I + Q + R + D)). Since the infection pressure is relatively stable without recent spikes, an even traffic allocation pattern is chosen to balance epidemic control and economic activity. This approach avoids sudden spikes in cases that could arise from relaxing restrictions too early or too late. The fractions sum exactly to 1, ensuring that total inbound flow remains constant over the 4-week period."

  "global_guidance": "In recommending inbound traffic control policies for Arkansas, a key consideration is managing the imported infection risk while balancing economic and mobility needs. Each origin state's infection pressure, as indicated by the ratios of exposed and infected individuals relative to their total population, informs the traffic allocation pattern. States with higher infection prevalence, such as Michigan, Ohio, Utah, and Idaho, are assigned stricter control in the initial weeks (lower fractions) with gradual relaxation, employing a relaxed-first pattern. This reduces early imported infections and allows for progressive reopening as risk subsides or control improves. Conversely, states with lower or stable infection levels, such as Alabama, Iowa, Nebraska, and Wisconsin, are allocated even traffic fractions to maintain steady mobility without risking sudden infection spikes. The quantitative cooperation logic involves maintaining total inbound flows constant (fractions sum to 1), but redistributing flow temporally to flatten infection import peaks, thus lowering cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. This approach balances epidemic control with the social-economic imperative of mobility. Sensitivity to prevalence and transmission parameters (beta) means that if infection rates rise or beta increases, stricter early controls would be warranted, potentially shifting more traffic restrictions to initial weeks. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta reduces, more relaxed-first or even patterns could be adopted earlier. This dynamic, evidence-based allocation enables Arkansas to minimize epidemic impact from inbound travel across diverse origin states while sustaining essential movement and commerce."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce expected imported infections and deaths in Arkansas, the strategy distributes inbound traffic to lower early-week flow from states with higher infection prevalence and significant inflow, while allowing moderate relaxation mid-period to balance mobility and economic activity. States with high infection and exposed counts such as Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Idaho, and Michigan adopt a strict-first pattern, reducing risk when Arkansas is most vulnerable to new seeding. States with lower infection prevalence or stable trends utilize even traffic flow distributions to maintain consistent mobility without spikes in imported infections. Quantitatively, imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/population), so lowering ft in early weeks for high-risk states reduces immediate importation, minimizing epidemic growth and deaths. Mid-period relaxation supports economic considerations, assuming local controls and immunity reduce risks. Late-period tightening anticipates potential resurgence or delayed effects. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence increases in an origin state or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early control fractions should be further reduced to compensate. Conversely, reductions in prevalence or beta allow more relaxed patterns and higher fractions earlier.

States with high infection and exposed counts such as Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Idaho, and Michigan adopt a strict-first pattern, reducing risk when Arkansas is most vulnerable to new seeding. States with lower infection prevalence or stable trends utilize even traffic flow distributions to maintain consistent mobility without spikes in imported infections. Quantitatively, imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/population), so lowering ft in early weeks for high-risk states reduces immediate importation, minimizing epidemic growth and deaths. Mid-period relaxation supports economic considerations, assuming local controls and immunity reduce risks. Late-period tightening anticipates potential resurgence or delayed effects. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence increases in an origin state or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early control fractions should be further reduced to compensate. Conversely, reductions in prevalence or beta allow more relaxed patterns and higher fractions earlier. This coordinated approach balances epidemic control and mobility across origin states and weeks, leveraging temporal and spatial heterogeneity to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Arkansas.'

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce expected imported infections and deaths in Arkansas, the traffic control policy prioritizes stricter controls in the initial weeks for states with higher infection prevalence (I) and confirmed cases (Q), especially those with high inbound flow, such as Texas, Oklahoma, Michigan, and Tennessee. This strict-first approach reduces immediate importation of infected individuals, which is critical given the infection transmission rate (beta=0.1337) and other SEIQRD parameters. For states with lower infection prevalence or lower flow, an even or relaxed-first pattern is applied to maintain economic and social activity while still controlling risk. The total inbound flows remain constant over the 4 weeks per origin state, preserving overall mobility but redistributing it to reduce peak infection pressure. The cooperation logic balances risk across states and weeks by shifting traffic from early high-risk periods to later weeks when local control measures may have improved or epidemic curves declined. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become more critical; conversely, if beta or I decrease, more relaxed policies might be sustainable. This dynamic allocation approach optimizes epidemic suppression in Arkansas while minimizing socioeconomic disruption."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce expected imported infections and deaths in Arkansas, the policy applies stricter traffic control measures in the early weeks (strict-first pattern) for states with higher infected populations or large inbound flows, front-loading restrictions to minimize early epidemic seeding. States with lower infection prevalence and moderate flow receive an even traffic allocation to stabilize mobility and prevent sudden disruptions. This coordinated balance across states and weeks leverages the nonlinear impact of early imported infections on epidemic growth, effectively reducing Arkansas's cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. Quantitatively, imported infections scale approximately as imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing fractions ft in weeks with high infection pressure or large flow limits infection importation. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence (I/population) or transmission rate beta increases, front-loaded strict control becomes more critical to prevent rapid outbreak. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta is lower, mobility can be relaxed earlier without significantly increasing epidemic risk. This adaptive, cooperative approach between states and weeks optimizes the trade-off between epidemic control and socioeconomic activity, ensuring Arkansas maintains manageable epidemic levels while preserving necessary mobility."

    "notes": "Alabama shows a very low number of infected individuals (I=884) compared to its very large susceptible population (S=4,791,788). The exposed (E=2,853) and confirmed (Q=27,369) cases are moderate relative to population size. The imported infected cases into Arkansas from Alabama can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/population), where the population is roughly the sum of all compartments (~4.82 million). The inflow is moderately large (6919 daily average). Given relatively low infection prevalence and stable numbers over the past 28 days, an even traffic allocation pattern is reasonable to balance mobility and epidemic risk. Strict early controls are less necessary since infection pressure is low and stable. Relaxing evenly maintains consistent economic and social activity while avoiding spikes in imported cases. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.25*4=1). This approach minimizes risk without excessive mobility restriction."

    "notes": "Arizona has a relatively higher infected population (I=1,626) and exposed (E=5,487) compared to Alabama, with significant confirmed cases (Q=119,478) indicating active epidemic presence. The susceptible population is large (6,978,095). The daily inflow to Arkansas is moderate (3022). To reduce peak imported infections, a strict-first pattern with lower traffic fractions early (0.20 in week 1) and gradually relaxed later (up to 0.30 in week 3) is chosen. This leverages the infection dynamics to reduce early importation when prevalence might be more critical, allowing some easing later. The fractions sum to 1 precisely, ensuring total inflow remains constant. This balances epidemic control by lowering early infection pressure while preserving later mobility."

The daily inflow to Arkansas is low (381.5), but infection rate is comparatively high. To minimize imported infections, a strict-first pattern is applied with a low initial fraction (0.15) to strongly reduce early importation, then relaxed later (up to 0.30). This approach reduces early seeding risk when infections are more likely to spread, while allowing mobility recovery later. The fractions sum exactly to 1. This policy prioritizes epidemic control given Idaho's higher prevalence."

The daily inflow is moderate (3,520). A strict-first pattern is selected to reduce early week traffic (0.18) to limit importation when infection pressure is high, gradually relaxing fractions towards week 4. This pattern addresses the trade-off between early containment and maintaining mobility later. The fractions sum to 1. This balances risk of imported infections with economic and social needs."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies collectively aim to minimize imported infections and deaths in Arkansas by strategically adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions from each origin state.

States with moderate or low infection prevalence and/or smaller inflows (e.g., Alabama, Nebraska, Virginia) have more even or slightly strict-first patterns to maintain consistent flow, minimizing economic disruption while controlling infection importation. The quantitative logic relies on the imported infected cases being proportional to Flow*ft*(I/Population), so reducing ft in early weeks from states with high I or large Flow reduces early seeding and cumulative cases. The overall fractions sum to 1 per state, keeping total inbound flow constant to avoid unintended mobility deficits or surpluses. Cross-state cooperation is implicit: reducing early flow from high-risk states prevents overwhelming Arkansas's healthcare system, while allowing later relaxation supports economic activity. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls or longer durations of low fractions would be necessary to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence declines or vaccination improves, fractions could be shifted towards more relaxed distributions. This dynamic balancing ensures epidemic control is optimized while mobility and economic impact are minimized, adapting to each state's epidemic and mobility profile."

Lower prevalence states maintain more even flow to avoid unnecessary disruption. The total inbound flow per origin remains constant, ensuring no net loss of mobility, but temporal redistribution mitigates epidemic peaks. The cooperation logic involves allocating stricter controls early for high-risk states, distributing flow over weeks to flatten importation pressure. This approach is sensitive to changes in prevalence and transmission rate beta; if prevalence rises, stricter early controls become more critical, whereas lower beta reduces urgency. By dynamically adjusting weekly fractions per origin based on infection pressure, this policy leverages inter-state risk differences to optimize epidemic control while preserving mobility.

    "notes": "Alabama has a large susceptible population (4,883,910) with relatively low exposed (1,306) and infected (385) individuals. The confirmed cases (14,562) are sizable but reflect quarantined individuals. The imported infections can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / Population) = 14,877 * ft * (385 / 4,883,910), indicating a low infection pressure per traveler. Given the relatively stable infection levels, an even traffic allocation (equal fractions) is chosen to balance mobility and epidemic control. This uniform pattern avoids sudden surges or drops in traffic, mitigating risks of outbreak spikes while maintaining essential mobility. The sum of fractions is exactly 1, validating the allocation."

The confirmed cases (29,842) are high, suggesting significant quarantine efforts. The risk of importing infected individuals is roughly Flow * ft * (494 / 7,247,763). Slightly relaxing traffic in week 1 (0.30) and tightening by week 4 (0.20) follows a relaxed-first pattern. This allows some economic activity early while anticipating reduction as cases might rise. Trade-offs include potential increased imported cases early but controlled later to prevent accumulation. Fractions sum to 1, ensuring flow consistency."

  "global_guidance": "The collective strategy across all origin states aims to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Arkansas by carefully modulating the weekly inbound traffic fractions while keeping the total 4-week flow constant per origin. States with higher infection prevalence (high I and E relative to S) such as Idaho, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas adopt a strict-first traffic pattern, reducing inbound flow in the initial week to curb early importation of infections when Arkansas' epidemic state is vulnerable. Gradual relaxation in later weeks balances epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs. States with lower infection pressure or stable low infection levels adopt even or slight strict-first patterns to maintain consistent flow and avoid sudden epidemic seeding. This cross-state coordination balances infection import risk across weeks, preventing peaks that could overwhelm Arkansas' health system. The quantitative cooperation logic leverages the infection prevalence ratios (I/S) and flows to estimate imported cases as Flow * ft * (I / Population), guiding the tightening or relaxing of traffic fractions. Sensitivity to changes in prevalence or transmission rates (beta) suggests that if infection rates rise, stricter early controls should be intensified. Conversely, if prevalence declines, more relaxed patterns may be feasible to support mobility. This dynamic and data-driven approach ensures that Arkansas can optimally reduce imported infections and deaths while sustaining essential interstate mobility."

The confirmed (13,142) and deaths (410) indicate moderate epidemic control. Importation risk can be roughly estimated as Flow * ft * (I / (S+E+I+Q+R+D)). Given the moderate infection prevalence and the large flow (27,935 daily), a balanced even distribution of traffic (even pattern) is chosen to maintain consistent control and mobility.

  "global_guidance": "The collective allocation strategy across origin states for Arkansas aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically balancing epidemic control and mobility. For states with high infected counts and large inflows (e.g., Oklahoma, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas), strict-first patterns reduce initial and late importation risks by imposing stricter controls in early or late weeks while allowing some mobility mid-period. For states with moderate infection prevalence and flow, relaxed-first or even patterns balance economic activity with health safety. Even patterns across several states with lower infection rates maintain steady control without imposing unnecessary restrictions that could harm mobility. Quantitatively, imported infections are proportional to Flow * ft * (I / Population), so adjusting weekly fractions ft effectively modulates risk while preserving total inbound traffic volume. Risk balancing across multiple states reduces peak importation pressure in any single week, preventing potential outbreak spikes in Arkansas. This cooperative temporal distribution leverages the varying infection prevalence and flow magnitude, achieving epidemic control while minimizing mobility disruption. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases in any state, stricter allocations (lower ft in early weeks) may be required to prevent seeding. Conversely, if epidemic parameters improve, allocations can shift toward more relaxed patterns to support mobility.

For states with high infected counts and large inflows (e.g., Oklahoma, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas), strict-first patterns reduce initial and late importation risks by imposing stricter controls in early or late weeks while allowing some mobility mid-period. For states with moderate infection prevalence and flow, relaxed-first or even patterns balance economic activity with health safety. Even patterns across several states with lower infection rates maintain steady control without imposing unnecessary restrictions that could harm mobility. Quantitatively, imported infections are proportional to Flow * ft * (I / Population), so adjusting weekly fractions ft effectively modulates risk while preserving total inbound traffic volume. Risk balancing across multiple states reduces peak importation pressure in any single week, preventing potential outbreak spikes in Arkansas. This cooperative temporal distribution leverages the varying infection prevalence and flow magnitude, achieving epidemic control while minimizing mobility disruption. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases in any state, stricter allocations (lower ft in early weeks) may be required to prevent seeding. Conversely, if epidemic parameters improve, allocations can shift toward more relaxed patterns to support mobility. This dynamic approach ensures Arkansas can adapt policies to evolving epidemic conditions across origin states, collectively minimizing imported infections and deaths.'
