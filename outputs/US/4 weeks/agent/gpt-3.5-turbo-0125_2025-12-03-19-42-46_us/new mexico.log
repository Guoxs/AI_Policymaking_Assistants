  "global_guidance": "The overall inbound traffic control strategy for New Mexico balances minimizing imported infections and maintaining mobility for socioeconomic needs. States with higher infectious pressure (higher I relative to S) and large flow volumes are prioritized for stricter early controls (strict-first pattern) to reduce seeding during the initial weeks, allowing local containment and avoiding amplification. Examples include Alabama, Idaho, Oklahoma, and Tennessee. States with lower infection prevalence or moderate flow are assigned even or relaxed-first patterns to avoid overly restrictive measures that could harm economic activity, such as Arizona and South Carolina. This cross-state coordination limits abrupt influx spikes across the 4 weeks, distributing risk temporally and spatially, thus preventing overwhelming local health capacity. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections scale with inbound flow × fraction × infection prevalence (I/S), so adjusting fractions controls the timing of imported cases. The approach is robust to uncertainties: if infection prevalence rises, stricter early controls become more critical; if transmission rate beta increases, reducing early imported infections gains importance. Sensitivity analysis suggests that balancing early strict control with gradual relaxation optimizes epidemic control and preserves mobility.

States with higher infectious pressure (higher I relative to S) and large flow volumes are prioritized for stricter early controls (strict-first pattern) to reduce seeding during the initial weeks, allowing local containment and avoiding amplification. Examples include Alabama, Idaho, Oklahoma, and Tennessee. States with lower infection prevalence or moderate flow are assigned even or relaxed-first patterns to avoid overly restrictive measures that could harm economic activity, such as Arizona and South Carolina. This cross-state coordination limits abrupt influx spikes across the 4 weeks, distributing risk temporally and spatially, thus preventing overwhelming local health capacity. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections scale with inbound flow × fraction × infection prevalence (I/S), so adjusting fractions controls the timing of imported cases. The approach is robust to uncertainties: if infection prevalence rises, stricter early controls become more critical; if transmission rate beta increases, reducing early imported infections gains importance. Sensitivity analysis suggests that balancing early strict control with gradual relaxation optimizes epidemic control and preserves mobility. All fraction allocations sum exactly to 1 per state, ensuring flow consistency with ground truth, and collectively reduce cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in New Mexico.'

Lower prevalence states maintain even traffic distribution to avoid unnecessary economic disruption. Traffic allocations sum to one for each state, preserving total inbound flow over 4 weeks. This temporal risk balancing reduces peak importations and allows gradual adaptation of controls. Cross-state coordination is critical: high-risk states reduce early traffic while lower-risk states maintain flow, collectively lowering overall infection influx. Sensitivity to beta and prevalence changes suggests that if transmission rates or infected proportions increase, stricter early control fractions should be further lowered to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence declines, more relaxed traffic patterns can be adopted safely. This dynamic approach optimizes epidemic control while preserving essential mobility and economic activity."

The expected imported infected are proportional to the inbound flow times the infected fraction (I/population). Given the daily average inbound flow of 2517.0, the risk can be mitigated by lowering traffic early to reduce immediate imported infections. We choose a strict-first pattern to front-load control (f1=0.30, f2=0.25) and gradually relax in later weeks (f3=0.25, f4=0.20). This approach balances epidemic control by reducing early exposure and allows some mobility recovery later. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000."

The inbound flow is large (25439.5 daily), so imported infections scale with flow*I/population. We adopt a relaxed-first pattern, allocating lower restriction early (f1=0.20) to avoid severe economic impact, then increasing control slightly in weeks 3 and 4 as mobility demand lessens and to prepare for potential outbreak peaks. This pattern aims to smooth infection risk while minimizing mobility disruption. The fractions sum to 1.000 exactly."

  "global_guidance": "The overall inbound traffic control strategy for New Mexico balances epidemic control and mobility by modulating traffic restrictions weekly across origin states based on their infection prevalence and inbound flow magnitudes. States with higher infected and exposed counts relative to their populations, especially those with substantial inbound flows (e.g., Idaho, Oklahoma, Utah), receive stricter early-week restrictions (strict-first pattern) to reduce immediate imported infections, thereby lowering the seeding risk for new outbreaks in New Mexico. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or extremely high flows (e.g., Texas) adopt an even distribution to avoid severe mobility disruption which could have significant economic impacts. The quantitative underpinning relies on the proportionality of expected imported infected cases to the product of inbound flow and the infected fraction (I/population). By adjusting weekly fractions to front-load or evenly spread traffic, we balance reducing early epidemic pressure and allowing gradual mobility normalization to minimize social and economic costs. The cooperation across states ensures that aggregated imported infections are minimized especially in the critical initial weeks when New Mexico's susceptible population is high and disease spread potential is significant. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence increases or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early restrictions should be intensified; if prevalence falls, controls can be relaxed earlier. This dynamic policy approach optimizes epidemic control by targeting high-risk sources and timing restrictions to coincide with infection pressure trends, while preserving essential mobility flows to sustain socio-economic functions. All fraction allocations strictly sum to 1, ensuring total inbound flows remain consistent with ground truth volumes, meeting constraints and preserving data integrity."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocations across origin states aim to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in New Mexico by strategically timing restrictions to reduce imported infections during high-risk periods. States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to their susceptible pools, such as Arkansas, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Utah, receive stricter traffic reductions in the initial weeks (strict-first pattern), frontloading epidemic control to prevent seeding new outbreaks. Conversely, states with lower or more stable infection rates adopt even or relaxed-first patterns to balance control with economic mobility. This cross-state cooperation effectively balances infection pressure by distributing restrictions temporally and spatially, preventing overwhelming importation spikes. Quantitatively, imported infected cases are proportional to the product of baseline flow, weekly fraction, and infection prevalence (I/pop). By modulating weekly fractions, we flatten infection import peaks, thus reducing downstream transmission and mortality. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early restrictions become more critical, emphasizing the need for adaptive policies. Conversely, lower prevalence allows more relaxed controls. Overall, this coordinated, data-informed policy approach optimizes epidemic mitigation while preserving essential mobility across states."

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy across all origin states is to minimize early imported infections into New Mexico, where local infections (I=2126) and exposed individuals (E=3546) remain significant. By adopting a strict-first control pattern for most origin statesallocating lower fractions (stricter controls) in later weeks and slightly higher fractions earlierwe reduce the immediate risk of seeding new infections in New Mexico. This front-loaded restriction dampens the initial infection pressure, allowing local epidemic control to gain ground. States with very large inflows or higher infection prevalence (e.g., Texas, Arizona, Arkansas, Tennessee) have more stringent front-week controls, minimizing their disproportionate importation risk. Conversely, origin states with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflows (e.g., Idaho, Oklahoma) use an even distribution to balance epidemic control and maintain essential mobility. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections from a state are proportional to Flow * ft * (I / population), so adjusting ft over weeks directly modulates weekly imported infection risk without changing total 4-week flow. This temporal reallocation smooths infection importation, preventing overwhelming New Mexico's control capacity. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence (I/population) increases in any origin state, stricter front-loaded controls would be warranted. Similarly, higher transmission rates (beta) in New Mexico amplify the importance of early importation control. Overall, the coordinated staggered restrictions across states and weeks reduce cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by flattening imported infection peaks while preserving aggregate mobility. This approach balances economic and social needs with public health imperatives."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce the imported infection risk into New Mexico, we balanced traffic control strategies across origin states by considering their respective infection prevalences and flow magnitudes. States with higher infected and exposed proportions relative to their populations (e.g., Arizona, Michigan, Ohio, Texas) adopt strict-first patterns with lower flow in early weeks to reduce initial imported infections and delay the spread within New Mexico. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or risk adopt either relaxed-first or even distributions to maintain economic activity while managing overall risk. The total daily inflow from each state remains constant over four weeks, preserving essential mobility but redistributing it temporally to flatten the infection import curve. This temporal balancing reduces peak infectious pressure and allows New Mexico's healthcare system more capacity to manage cases. The risk balancing considers the formula for expected imported infections as Flow*ft*(I/Population), ensuring that weeks with higher infection prevalence receive lower traffic fractions. Sensitivity analysis shows that if the prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early-week controls would be necessary to prevent surges. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed or even distributions could be applied to support mobility.

States with higher infected and exposed proportions relative to their populations (e.g., Arizona, Michigan, Ohio, Texas) adopt strict-first patterns with lower flow in early weeks to reduce initial imported infections and delay the spread within New Mexico. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or risk adopt either relaxed-first or even distributions to maintain economic activity while managing overall risk. The total daily inflow from each state remains constant over four weeks, preserving essential mobility but redistributing it temporally to flatten the infection import curve. This temporal balancing reduces peak infectious pressure and allows New Mexico's healthcare system more capacity to manage cases. The risk balancing considers the formula for expected imported infections as Flow*ft*(I/Population), ensuring that weeks with higher infection prevalence receive lower traffic fractions. Sensitivity analysis shows that if the prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early-week controls would be necessary to prevent surges. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed or even distributions could be applied to support mobility. Coordinated policies across states, with attention to their epidemic states and flow volumes, minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in New Mexico while sustaining essential interstate travel."

  "global_guidance": "The overall inbound flow allocation strategy balances epidemic control and mobility preservation by modulating weekly fractions for each origin state, while keeping total 4-week inbound flow constant. States with higher infection and exposed prevalence (e.g., Utah, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin) are assigned stricter controls in early weeks (lower fractions) to minimize early importation of infected individuals, which is critical to prevent seeding outbreaks in New Mexico. Conversely, states with low infection prevalence (e.g., Alabama, Virginia, Nebraska) have even or relaxed patterns, reflecting lower risk. The strict-first or relaxed-first fraction patterns reflect the infection pressure trends and the expected impact on New Mexico's epidemic trajectory. Quantitatively, imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/Population), so reducing ft in weeks with higher infection prevalence effectively reduces imported cases. This temporal balancing mitigates cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter control fractions in early weeks become more crucial. Conversely, if prevalence falls or immunity rises, more relaxed fractions are feasible. Cross-state cooperation is implicit: total inbound is conserved, but temporal redistribution reduces peak importation risk, smoothing epidemic impact. This approach respects socioeconomic needs by avoiding prolonged strict control, enabling gradual mobility restoration. Fractions sum exactly to one per state, ensuring consistency in total traffic volume."

    "notes": "Alabama has a large susceptible population (~4.76 million) with relatively low exposed (3523) and infected (1087) counts. The ratio of infected to population is low, suggesting moderate risk of importation of infected individuals. The inflow to New Mexico is about 1927 daily on average. The expected imported infected cases can be approximated by Flow * ft * (I / population). Given the low prevalence, a balanced even distribution of traffic control (even pattern) is appropriate to avoid abrupt mobility disruptions while maintaining reasonable control. This approach ensures the total inbound flow over 4 weeks remains constant and sums exactly to 1. Trade-offs favor moderate controls evenly spread to reduce peak infection importation risk without severely impacting mobility."

    "notes": "Arizona shows a large susceptible population (~6.9 million) and higher exposed (4987) and infected (1483) counts compared to Alabama, indicating higher infection pressure. The large inflow of 43,660 daily necessitates careful timing of traffic relaxation. Using imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), concentrating more flow in the later weeks (relaxed-first pattern) allows for stricter control initially when infection pressure is higher, tapering as conditions possibly improve. This pattern balances epidemic control by reducing early importation risk while allowing some recovery of mobility later. The fractions sum to exactly 1, validating consistency."

    "notes": "Arkansas has moderate susceptible population (~2.9 million) but relatively high exposed (8004) and infected (4501) numbers, indicating significant infection pressure. Daily inflow is 2376 on average. To mitigate risk, restricting inbound flow more in later weeks (strict-first pattern) helps prevent sustained high infection importation as the epidemic may worsen. Early weeks have relatively relaxed flow to maintain some mobility, but heavier restrictions later help control cumulative impact. This trade-off optimizes epidemic control without drastic mobility loss upfront. The fractions sum to 1 exactly."

Average daily inflow is 1358. Here, a strict-first pattern (more restrictions upfront) is justified to sharply reduce early importation risk from a highly infectious origin. Flow allocation decreases over weeks, balancing epidemic control with gradual mobility restoration. This minimizes initial infection seeding in New Mexico while allowing some recovery in later weeks.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic control policies for New Mexico strategically balance epidemic control and mobility preservation by tailoring weekly flow fractions per origin based on their infection prevalence and population sizes. States with higher infected or exposed ratios per capita and/or large inbound flows, such as Idaho, Utah, Texas, and Oklahoma, receive stricter early-week restrictions (strict-first pattern) to minimize early importation of infections, which is critical to prevent exacerbation of New Mexicos epidemic burden. This approach delays and reduces the seeding of active infections, thus lowering cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or inflows, like Alabama, Iowa, and Wisconsin, are assigned even traffic allocations to sustain mobility with moderate epidemic risk. The rationale uses the approximation that imported infected cases scale with the product of inflow, weekly fraction, and infected proportion (imported_infected ~ Flow*ft * (I/population)). By adjusting the weekly fractions while keeping total flow constant, the policy redistributes infection risk temporally to prevent simultaneous high importation from multiple sources. This temporal staggering is a form of quantitative cooperation that achieves epidemic control synergy across states. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early-week fractions may be beneficial to further suppress importation. Alternatively, if prevalence declines or vaccination coverage rises, more relaxed patterns can be safely adopted. Overall, these policies aim to minimize New Mexicos epidemic impact while preserving essential mobility and economic activity, validated by fraction sums equaling exactly one for each state, ensuring no unauthorized flow volume changes."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic control policies for New Mexico optimize epidemic control by modulating weekly traffic fractions based on the infection prevalence and inflow from each origin state. States with higher infected-to-susceptible ratios and/or high daily inflow, such as South Carolina, Oklahoma, Idaho, Arkansas, and Utah, are assigned stricter control in the early weeks (lower fractions initially) to minimize imported infections when New Mexico's local epidemic is vulnerable. This strict-first pattern reduces initial infection pressure and prevents seeding new outbreaks. Conversely, states with relatively lower infection prevalence or very high inflow but low infection burden, like Texas, Arizona, and Ohio, have relaxed-first or gradually increasing fraction patterns to balance economic activity and risk. States with moderate prevalence and inflow adopt even fractions to maintain stable control and mobility. Collectively, these policies reduce cumulative imported infections by timing traffic restrictions when risk is highest and relaxing when conditions improve or immunity builds. The sum of fractions for each state is exactly 1.000, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant, preserving mobility baselines while reshaping temporal risk. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence increases or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early-week controls would be warranted to prevent surges. Conversely, if prevalence declines or vaccination improves immunity, fractions could be more evenly distributed or relaxed earlier. This approach balances epidemic control and mobility, stabilizing New Mexico's epidemic trajectory while minimizing societal disruption."

The importation risk can be approximated by Flow*ft*(I/S), indicating that the number of infected travelers entering New Mexico depends heavily on the fraction allocated per week. Given Alabama's relatively stable epidemic state and moderate infection prevalence, an even distribution (0.25 each week) balances epidemic control and economic mobility.

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in New Mexico, the recommended inbound traffic allocation balances epidemic pressure across origin states and weeks. States with higher infection prevalence (e.g., Arkansas, Idaho, Michigan, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah) receive stricter early-week controls to reduce initial imported infections, while gradually relaxing controls later as epidemic conditions potentially improve or stabilize. This 'strict-first' or 'relaxed-first' pattern mitigates peak importation risk while preserving economic activity. States with stable or lower infection prevalence (e.g., Alabama, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, Virginia, Wisconsin) are assigned even traffic fractions, reflecting balanced risk and mobility needs. The total inbound flow from each state remains constant over four weeks, preserving travel demand but modulating weekly distribution for epidemic control. Quantitatively, imported infected travelers are approximated as Flow*ft*(I/S), making fraction allocation a key lever to reduce infection importation. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more critical to prevent case surges. Conversely, lower prevalence allows more even or relaxed traffic patterns to support economic mobility without compromising public health. Coordinated inter-state allocations reduce cumulative risk by distributing travel volume away from peak infection periods and high-prevalence states, preventing synchronized importation spikes. This cooperative strategy balances epidemic control with mobility, optimizing public health protection while minimizing socioeconomic disruption."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the recommended policies aim to reduce the cumulative imported infections and deaths in New Mexico by managing the timing and volume of inbound traffic according to each origin state's epidemic status. States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to susceptible (e.g., Michigan, Indiana, Texas, Ohio, Arizona) receive stricter early restrictions (low initial fractions) to reduce early importation of cases, leveraging the fact that imported infections scale roughly as Flow*ft*(I/(S+E)). Subsequently, these flows are gradually relaxed to permit economic activity while maintaining control. States with moderate or low infection pressure are assigned either even distributions or relaxed-first patterns, allowing higher initial flows but tightening later to prevent late surges. This dynamic reallocation balances epidemic control and mobility demands. Quantitatively, by keeping total flow constant but shifting fractions over weeks, we prevent early surges of imported infections which have a higher potential to seed outbreaks and deaths in New Mexico. Sensitivity analysis shows that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become even more critical, while if transmission decreases, more relaxed early flows can be tolerated. The coordinated approach across states ensures that New Mexico does not face simultaneous high importation pressure from multiple high-risk origins in the same week, thereby flattening the imported infection curve and supporting healthcare capacity. This inter-state cooperation and temporal smoothing minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases effectively."

States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to susceptible (e.g., Michigan, Indiana, Texas, Ohio, Arizona) receive stricter early restrictions (low initial fractions) to reduce early importation of cases, leveraging the fact that imported infections scale roughly as Flow*ft*(I/(S+E)). Subsequently, these flows are gradually relaxed to permit economic activity while maintaining control. States with moderate or low infection pressure are assigned either even distributions or relaxed-first patterns, allowing higher initial flows but tightening later to prevent late surges. This dynamic reallocation balances epidemic control and mobility demands. Quantitatively, by keeping total flow constant but shifting fractions over weeks, we prevent early surges of imported infections which have a higher potential to seed outbreaks and deaths in New Mexico. Sensitivity analysis shows that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become even more critical, while if transmission decreases, more relaxed early flows can be tolerated. The coordinated approach across states ensures that New Mexico does not face simultaneous high importation pressure from multiple high-risk origins in the same week, thereby flattening the imported infection curve and supporting healthcare capacity. This inter-state cooperation and temporal smoothing minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases effectively."

The infected proportion is very low (~0.000095). Despite the huge past inflow (10.7M), the current ground truth inbound flow to New Mexico is moderate (2010 daily). The expected imported infections can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/population). Given the low infection prevalence, a more relaxed pattern can be applied, but slightly favoring more flow in later weeks to minimize early imported infections and allow time for local control. The chosen pattern is relaxed-first: fractions increase over weeks [0.15, 0.25, 0.30, 0.30], allowing stricter control initially to reduce early seeding risk and then relaxing as local measures take effect. This balances epidemic control with maintaining mobility. The fractions sum exactly to 1, ensuring the total inflow is constant over 4 weeks."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic control policy for New Mexico strategically balances epidemic control and mobility by adjusting weekly flow fractions from each origin state. States with higher infected proportions relative to their populations (e.g., Utah, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Wisconsin) receive stricter early controls, reducing the risk of seeding new infections in New Mexico during the critical initial weeks when local infections remain elevated. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence but large flows (e.g., Texas, Alabama, Arizona) are assigned relaxed-first patterns that impose moderate initial restrictions but gradually relax to sustain economic activity without significantly increasing epidemic risk. This cross-state coordination minimizes cumulative imported infections and deaths by delaying and reducing the initial seeding pressure, allowing New Mexico's local health infrastructure and interventions to manage outbreaks effectively. The total inbound flow from each origin state remains constant over four weeks, preserving overall mobility demands while adjusting temporal distribution to optimize epidemic outcomes. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase in certain origin states, stricter early reductions could further decrease imported cases. Conversely, if local New Mexico prevalence declines substantially, relaxation can be expedited. This adaptive framework ensures responsiveness to evolving epidemic conditions, balancing public health and mobility needs. All fraction vectors sum exactly to 1, maintaining consistency with flow constraints and enabling straightforward implementation."

We choose an even allocation pattern (0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25) to distribute risk consistently over the 4 weeks, balancing mobility and epidemic control without sudden relaxations that could spike cases. This approach smooths imported infection pressure without drastic mobility restrictions. The fractions sum exactly to 1."

The large daily average inbound flow (28,233) implies a significant risk of imported infections: imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population). We adopt a relaxed-first pattern, gradually increasing fractions over 4 weeks (0.15 to 0.35).

  "global_guidance": "The collective allocation strategy aims to minimize expected imported infections into New Mexico by considering each origin state's epidemic prevalence (E, I) and inbound flow. States with higher infected and exposed counts combined with high inbound flows (e.g., Texas, Arizona, Ohio, Utah) receive a relaxed-first pattern with stricter controls initially and gradual relaxation to reduce early imported infection spikes while accommodating economic needs later. States with moderate or lower infection prevalence or smaller flows adopt even or strict-first patterns to balance imported infection risk and mobility steadily. The total daily inbound flow per state remains fixed, but weekly fractions are tuned to reduce cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in New Mexico by controlling early infection importation more strictly, flattening the infection import curve. This coordinated approach balances epidemic control and economic activity, avoiding abrupt relaxations that could cause surges. Sensitivity analysis suggests if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter frontloading (lower early fractions) would be more beneficial to reduce imported infections. Conversely, if prevalence declines, more even or relaxed patterns could be adopted to support economic recovery. The fractions sum exactly to one per state, ensuring inflow totals remain constant and policy is implementable. This coordinated mobility control leverages heterogeneity across states and time to optimize epidemic outcomes for New Mexico."

The infection prevalence (I+E)/total is very low, so the risk of importing infected cases is modest. The imported infected cases approximately relate to Flow * ft * (I / population). Given the stable infection rates and low prevalence, an even distribution pattern is justified to maintain mobility balance and avoid abrupt restrictions.

  },
  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies collectively aim to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in New Mexico by adjusting the timing of inbound flows from various origin states while keeping total inflow constant. States with higher infection prevalence (I+E) relative to their population, such as Idaho, Utah, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Wisconsin, are assigned stricter controls in the early weeks to reduce the risk of importing infected individuals when New Mexico's local epidemic is vulnerable. This strict-first pattern delays potential seeding of new cases, flattening the epidemic curve and reducing health system strain. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller flows, such as Alabama and Virginia, adopt an even distribution to balance epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs. Larger origin states with substantial flows but moderate infection levels, such as Texas and Arizona, use a relaxed-first pattern, gradually increasing allowed flow to avoid overwhelming mobility restrictions while still controlling early risk. Quantitatively, imported infections are roughly proportional to Flow * ft * (I/population). By shifting fractions toward later weeks for high-risk states, the expected imported infections during critical early periods are reduced. This temporal balancing can delay and reduce epidemic peaks in New Mexico. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls should be intensified, as the risk of importation rises nonlinearly. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or local immunity increases, controls can be relaxed sooner. This coordinated inter-state mobility management, respecting constant total flows but redistributing weekly fractions, optimizes the trade-off between epidemic mitigation and maintaining essential mobility and economic functions. The chosen fractions for each state sum exactly to 1, ensuring consistency with ground truth total flows."

Given the large average daily inflow (1490.93), the expected imported infected cases roughly scale with flow * fraction * (I / population). To minimize risk, a strict-first pattern is chosen, imposing stricter controls early (week 1 fraction = 0.20) when the epidemic pressure is higher in New Mexico, then gradually relaxing controls (up to 0.30 in week 3) as local control improves. This balances epidemic control, reducing the imported infection load initially, while allowing some mobility later. The four fractions sum exactly to 1: 0.20 + 0.25 + 0.30 + 0.25 = 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocation across all origin states employs mostly a strict-first pattern, where inbound flow fractions are lower in the initial weeks and increase over time. This approach is justified because New Mexico currently has active infections (I=3,066) and exposed (E=5,421), implying that the epidemic can be exacerbated by early high importations. By reducing inbound flow in the early weeks from states with higher infection prevalence and/or large inflows, we minimize the number of imported infections and deaths during the critical initial phase. Collectively, this staggered approach reduces the cumulative infection pressure on New Mexicos health system, allowing local interventions to take effect. Quantitatively, the expected imported infected cases per week from each origin state are approximately proportional to the product of the average daily inflow, the weekly fraction, and the ratio of infected individuals to the origin state's population. By strategically lowering fractions in early weeks for states with relatively higher I/population ratios or large inflow volumes (e.g., Texas, Arizona, Utah), the total imported infection load is more evenly distributed across time, preventing surges. This cooperative balancing across states and weeks enables New Mexico to manage risk effectively while gradually relaxing restrictions to accommodate economic and social mobility demands. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence (I/population) or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become even more crucial, reinforcing the chosen strict-first pattern. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, the fractions could be adjusted towards more even or relaxed-first patterns to improve mobility with minimal epidemic risk. Overall, this policy recommendation optimally balances epidemic control and mobility by leveraging temporal traffic control patterns informed by the epidemic state of each origin state and New Mexicos local context."

The imported infected number roughly follows imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population). Since I/population is low, risk is moderate. The past inflow baseline is about 1926 daily. Given moderate infection pressure and relatively stable epidemic state, an even allocation pattern is chosen to balance epidemic control and economic mobility. Strict controls early or late are less justified as infection levels are stable. This evenly spreads imported risk over 4 weeks, reducing peaks and avoiding sudden influxes.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations collectively aim to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in New Mexico by strategically balancing epidemic control and mobility across origin states and over the next 4 weeks. States with high infection prevalence relative to their population and/or large inflow volumes to New Mexico, such as Texas, Arizona, Utah, Idaho, and Arkansas, are allocated stricter controls in the initial weeks to suppress early imported infections when the risk of seeding new outbreaks is highest. This is implemented via a strict-first traffic control pattern, with lower fractions in weeks 1 and 2 and gradual relaxation in weeks 3 and 4. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or lower inflow volumes, such as Alabama, Iowa, Minnesota, and Virginia, receive even or moderately balanced allocations to maintain economic activity while managing epidemic risk. The quantitative cooperation logic is based on the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/population), where ft is the weekly fraction of baseline flow. By adjusting ft to be lower during weeks when infection prevalence or epidemic growth is expected to be higher, the policy reduces the immediate risk of imported cases that could spark surges in New Mexico. This staggered approach also avoids overwhelming economic disruption by permitting more relaxed controls in later weeks or for lower-risk states. Sensitivity reasoning shows that if infection prevalence (I/population) or transmissibility (beta) increases, stricter early controls would be even more critical to prevent import-driven outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence declines, the policy could shift toward more even or relaxed traffic allocations. These recommendations ensure that the sum of fractions for each origin state equals exactly 1, preserving total inbound flow while optimizing timing to reduce epidemic impact.

States with high infection prevalence relative to their population and/or large inflow volumes to New Mexico, such as Texas, Arizona, Utah, Idaho, and Arkansas, are allocated stricter controls in the initial weeks to suppress early imported infections when the risk of seeding new outbreaks is highest. This is implemented via a strict-first traffic control pattern, with lower fractions in weeks 1 and 2 and gradual relaxation in weeks 3 and 4. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or lower inflow volumes, such as Alabama, Iowa, Minnesota, and Virginia, receive even or moderately balanced allocations to maintain economic activity while managing epidemic risk. The quantitative cooperation logic is based on the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/population), where ft is the weekly fraction of baseline flow. By adjusting ft to be lower during weeks when infection prevalence or epidemic growth is expected to be higher, the policy reduces the immediate risk of imported cases that could spark surges in New Mexico. This staggered approach also avoids overwhelming economic disruption by permitting more relaxed controls in later weeks or for lower-risk states. Sensitivity reasoning shows that if infection prevalence (I/population) or transmissibility (beta) increases, stricter early controls would be even more critical to prevent import-driven outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence declines, the policy could shift toward more even or relaxed traffic allocations. These recommendations ensure that the sum of fractions for each origin state equals exactly 1, preserving total inbound flow while optimizing timing to reduce epidemic impact. This coordinated, data-driven policy balances public health with mobility needs, aiming to minimize overall disease burden in New Mexico.'

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the traffic control policies reduce expected imported infections by allocating stricter controls (lower fractions) during weeks of potentially higher infection pressure or vulnerable local conditions, while relaxing controls mid-period to balance mobility and economic needs. This staggered pattern across states helps distribute importation risk over time, preventing simultaneous peaks that could overwhelm New Mexico's health resources. Quantitatively, expected imported infected cases scale with Flow*ft*(I/population), so controlling ft in weeks with higher infection prevalence or higher inbound flows effectively reduces imported cases. The patterns chosen (even, relaxed-first, strict-first) depend on each state's infection prevalence and inbound flow magnitude, balancing epidemic control and mobility. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter controls early and late would be increasingly beneficial. Conversely, if beta or prevalence decreases, more even or relaxed patterns could be adopted. The policies maintain total inbound flow constant (sum of fractions =1), ensuring no economic loss from total reduction but controlling temporal distribution to minimize epidemic impact. This coordinated approach across states optimizes the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in New Mexico."
