The imported infections approximately scale with Flow*ft*(I/S), indicating that restricting flow earlier reduces infections imported to Michigan. Alabama's infection pressure appears stable but non-negligible, so a strict-first pattern is chosen to mitigate early risks by imposing tighter controls initially and gradually relaxing them as expected infections decrease. This approach balances epidemic control with mobility needs, reducing immediate importation risks but allowing some recovery of flow later. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

Given the moderate infection pressure, a strict-first pattern is used to front-load reductions in inbound traffic, minimizing early seeding of cases in Michigan.

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocations for Michigan from all origin states collectively prioritize minimizing early-week importation of infections, as early seeding can lead to exponential growth and higher cumulative cases and deaths. States with higher infection prevalence relative to their susceptible population and/or higher inflow volumes to Michigan are assigned stricter controls in the initial weeks (strict-first pattern), reducing the volume of potentially infected travelers entering Michigan early on. This approach delays and reduces initial imported infections, allowing Michigan's local epidemic control measures more time to respond and lowering overall epidemic burden. For states with lower infection prevalence or more stable infection pressure, even distributions are used to balance mobility and epidemic risk without imposing excessive restrictions. A few states with indications of increasing infection trends adopt a relaxed-first pattern, allowing moderate early flow but tightening mid-period to mitigate anticipated risk increases. Total daily inbound flows are preserved by adjusting weekly fractions to sum exactly to 1, ensuring mobility baselines remain unchanged over the 4-week horizon. This coordinated allocation across states and weeks achieves risk balancing, reducing peaks of imported infections while maintaining essential mobility. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) increase, stricter and earlier controls would be even more critical to reduce imported infection pressure. Conversely, if prevalence falls or vaccination increases, controls could be relaxed more rapidly. Overall, this policy framework balances epidemic control and economic mobility by dynamically scheduling traffic restrictions based on infection prevalence, inflow magnitude, and epidemic trends in origin states."

Given the inbound flow of 8,479 per day, the expected imported infections roughly scale with Flow*ft*(I/S). To mitigate importation, a strict-first allocation pattern is chosen, concentrating strict control in the earliest weeks (f1=0.35, f2=0.30) to reduce early seeding of infections into Michigan, which currently has moderate infection levels. Relaxing controls later (f3=0.20, f4=0.15) balances economic and mobility needs while minimizing cumulative epidemic burden. This pattern leverages the incubation period and Michigan’s capacity to contain infections if initial importation is reduced. The fractions sum exactly to 1.0000, ensuring consistent total flow."

Given relatively stable infection pressure with no strong upward or downward trend indicated, an even distribution of traffic control is optimal. Equal fractions (0.25 each) minimize importation risk consistently over 4 weeks and maintain mobility. Expected imported infections relate to Flow*ft*(I/S), so flattening ft avoids spikes in importation risk. This balanced approach supports epidemic control without heavy front-loading of strict measures. The fractions sum to exactly 1.0000."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, these inbound traffic control allocations prioritize reducing Michigan's epidemic burden by focusing stricter controls in earlier weeks for states with higher infection and exposure burdens, and maintaining balanced controls for states with moderate or stable prevalence. This strategy minimizes the seeding of infections into Michigan during the critical early phase, leveraging the virus incubation period and Michigan's epidemic dynamics. Quantitatively, imported infections scale with the product of inbound flow, control fraction, and infection prevalence (I/S), so reducing flow fractions in weeks with highest risk reduces cumulative cases and deaths. Balancing strict early controls with gradual relaxation supports mobility and economic activity, essential across multiple origin states. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates rise, stricter early week controls become more critical, while declining prevalence would allow more balanced or relaxed patterns. Coordination across states ensures cumulative flow remains constant, avoiding unintended shifts of risk to later weeks or other states. These policies are designed to optimize epidemic control and mobility trade-offs under current data, while being adaptable to changing epidemic conditions."

The exposed count E=1,468 is also low. The expected imported infections can be approximated as imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population), where population ~ sum of SEIQRD states. Given the inflow is moderate (7668 daily), a strict-first allocation pattern is chosen to reduce imported infections initially by lowering traffic in week 1 (fraction 0.3) and gradually relaxing in later weeks. This approach aims to minimize early seeding of infections in Michigan while balancing mobility needs over the month. The fractions sum exactly to 1.0."

  "global_guidance": "The collective allocation strategy across origin states aims to minimize imported infections and deaths in Michigan by strategically modulating inbound traffic over the next 4 weeks. States with high infection prevalence (high I and E values) and large inflows to Michigan are assigned stricter controls in early weeks (strict-first pattern) to reduce the chance of seeding new outbreaks early. For example, Indiana and Ohio, with extremely high inflows and infection counts, have relaxed traffic in later weeks to allow better resource allocation and reduced immediate importation risk. States with moderate or low infection prevalence and inflow are balanced with even traffic distribution to maintain mobility while managing risk. States with moderate infection counts and inflows but with steady infection pressure adopt relaxed-first patterns to delay peak importations when Michigan's control capacity may improve. Quantitatively, imported infections are roughly proportional to the product of inflow, traffic fraction, and infection prevalence (I/population). By decreasing fractions in weeks of high infection prevalence, cumulative imported cases decrease. The sum of fractions per state equals exactly 1 to respect constant total inflow over 4 weeks. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early restrictions become more critical to control importations. Conversely, if prevalence drops or vaccination improves, more relaxed patterns could be implemented. This balanced policy aims to reduce Michigan's epidemic burden while preserving essential mobility, using a dynamic, data-driven approach to traffic control allocation."

The exposed population (1,154) and confirmed cases (9,636) are moderate. Given the low infectious prevalence (I/population), the expected imported infections ~ Flow * ft * (I/population) should be relatively low. The traffic allocation follows an even pattern (equal fractions each week) to maintain consistent mobility while controlling risk. This balances the trade-off between preventing spikes in infections and supporting steady travel flow. Adjusting weekly proportions does not reduce risk significantly due to steady infection levels. The fractions sum exactly to 1, validating the allocation."

The confirmed cases (80,895) are relatively high, suggesting significant active management. The imported infections roughly scale as Flow * ft * (I/population). To minimize risk, stricter control is recommended later (weeks 3 and 4) when mobility might increase naturally. Hence, a relaxed-first pattern is chosen with higher fractions in weeks 1 and 2 and reduced in weeks 3 and 4, to dampen infection importation during potential growth periods.

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce expected imported infections and deaths in Michigan, we allocate inbound traffic fractions from origin states based on their infection prevalence and inflow magnitude. States with higher infected and exposed proportions and large inflow volumes, such as Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alabama, have stricter early-week controls (lower fractions in week 1), gradually relaxing later to balance mobility and epidemic control. This strict-first pattern limits initial importation risk when Michigan's local epidemic is vulnerable. States with moderate infection prevalence but higher infection growth risk, such as Arizona, Idaho, Utah, Minnesota, and New Mexico, follow a relaxed-first pattern with higher inflow early, then stricter later, to accommodate economic activity while preventing late resurgence. States with relatively low infection pressure or smaller inflow volumes use an even pattern for steady control and mobility. Quantitatively, expected imported infections scale as Flow multiplied by the fraction allocated to the week and the infected proportion in the source state. By shifting fractions over weeks, we distribute risk temporally to avoid peaks of importation and reduce cumulative infections and deaths. Sensitivity to parameters like infection rate (beta) and prevalence is acknowledged; if infection prevalence increases or beta rises, stricter early restrictions would be warranted. Conversely, if prevalence declines or beta reduces, more relaxed patterns may be feasible. This policy approach balances epidemic control, mobility needs, and economic impacts, optimizing Michigan's outcome over the next four weeks."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic control policy for Michigan from its origin states strategically balances epidemiological risk and mobility needs over the next four weeks. States with higher infection prevalence (I and E relative to S) such as Arizona, Utah, and Minnesota adopt stricter control early (strict-first pattern) to reduce the influx of infectious individuals when risk is highest, thereby lowering cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Michigan. Conversely, states with high traffic volumes but moderate or lower infection prevalence, like Ohio and Texas, employ a relaxed-first pattern to support economic activity initially while tightening controls later as infection pressure potentially rises. States with moderate or stable infection levels use even distribution to maintain consistent control and avoid abrupt changes that could destabilize mobility or epidemic dynamics. This cross-state coordination prevents synchronized peaks in imported infections, smoothing Michigan's epidemic curve and reducing healthcare burden. Quantitatively, the inbound infected individuals can be estimated as the product of inbound flow, weekly fraction, and infection prevalence (I/population). By adjusting weekly fractions to lower values in earlier weeks for higher-risk states, imported infections are minimized when Michigan is most vulnerable. As local and origin state prevalence evolves, relaxing controls in later weeks allows for essential mobility without substantial risk increase. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection rates or transmissibility (beta) rise, stricter early control would be even more critical, while reductions in prevalence could permit more uniform or relaxed allocations.

States with higher infection prevalence (I and E relative to S) such as Arizona, Utah, and Minnesota adopt stricter control early (strict-first pattern) to reduce the influx of infectious individuals when risk is highest, thereby lowering cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Michigan. Conversely, states with high traffic volumes but moderate or lower infection prevalence, like Ohio and Texas, employ a relaxed-first pattern to support economic activity initially while tightening controls later as infection pressure potentially rises. States with moderate or stable infection levels use even distribution to maintain consistent control and avoid abrupt changes that could destabilize mobility or epidemic dynamics. This cross-state coordination prevents synchronized peaks in imported infections, smoothing Michigan's epidemic curve and reducing healthcare burden. Quantitatively, the inbound infected individuals can be estimated as the product of inbound flow, weekly fraction, and infection prevalence (I/population). By adjusting weekly fractions to lower values in earlier weeks for higher-risk states, imported infections are minimized when Michigan is most vulnerable. As local and origin state prevalence evolves, relaxing controls in later weeks allows for essential mobility without substantial risk increase. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection rates or transmissibility (beta) rise, stricter early control would be even more critical, while reductions in prevalence could permit more uniform or relaxed allocations. This policy thus dynamically balances epidemic control with societal and economic needs, leveraging temporal and spatial heterogeneity in infection risk across states and weeks."

The risk of imported infections is roughly proportional to inbound flow times the infected proportion: imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)). Given the flow (6931 daily average), spreading it with a strict-first pattern (lower fractions first weeks) helps reduce immediate infection pressure on Michigan, allowing time for Michigan's local measures to adapt. The exposed and infected numbers indicate moderate risk, so moderate initial strict control is justified.

  "global_guidance": "The traffic control allocations for Michigan carefully balance epidemic control and mobility by adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions per origin state based on infection prevalence and traffic volumes. States with higher infected and exposed ratios, especially those with large inbound flows such as Ohio, Indiana, and Wisconsin, receive stricter early restrictions (strict-first pattern) to minimize immediate imported infections and reduce cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Michigan. This front-loaded control allows Michigan to better manage local outbreaks and preserve healthcare capacity. Conversely, states with more stable or lower infection pressures, or smaller flows, are assigned even or relaxed-first patterns to maintain economic and social connectivity while still mitigating risk. The total inbound flow per origin state remains constant over the 4 weeks, preserving overall mobility but shifting timing to optimize epidemic outcomes. This cooperative strategy reduces synchronized peaks of imported infections across states and weeks, smoothing Michigan's epidemic curve and lowering mortality risk. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence increases or transmissibility (beta) rises, stricter controls in early weeks become even more critical. Alternatively, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed patterns could be adopted to support recovery. The approach is adaptive and data-driven, ensuring Michigan balances public health imperatives with mobility needs effectively."

    "notes": "Alabama has a relatively moderate number of infected individuals (I=1087) compared to its large susceptible population (S=4762006). Given the total past 28-day average inflow to Michigan (7595.07 daily), the expected imported infected cases roughly scale with Flow*ft*(I/S). Early weeks are assigned stricter controls (lower fractions) to reduce the immediate importation risk, following a strict-first pattern. This helps to lower Michigan's epidemic pressure upfront, where the risk is highest due to current infected numbers in Alabama. The trade-off is some mobility restriction early on but allows gradual relaxation as infection risk declines or is managed. The four fractions sum exactly to 1.0 with three decimals."

Given the inflow (16802.28 daily), imported infected scale with Flow*ft*(I/S). The inflow is significant, so early strict control (lower f1 and f2) is chosen to minimize initial importation, reducing Michigan's epidemic growth risk. The relaxed last weeks reflect a gradual reopening pattern as immediate risk diminishes. This strict-first approach balances epidemic control and mobility, reducing peak infection pressure, and allowing economic activity later. The fractions sum to exactly 1.0."

However, the inflow to Michigan is low (4014.28 daily), limiting overall importation risk. An even distribution of fractions (equal weekly proportions) balances mobility and control, avoiding excessive restriction that may not yield proportional epidemic benefits. The imported infected roughly follow Flow*ft*(I/S). The even pattern allows consistent moderate control, considering the moderate risk and mobility needs. Fractions precisely sum to 1.0."

Inflow is small (722.1 daily), so absolute risk is limited but non-negligible. A slightly relaxed second week (f2=0.28) is chosen assuming possible local control improvements, with stricter control initially to reduce immediate risk. The mixed pattern controls early importation but allows some mobility recovery mid-term. The formula Flow*ft*(I/S) guides these fractions to balance epidemic and mobility trade-offs.

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocations prioritize stricter controls in earlier weeks for states exhibiting higher infection prevalence (high I and E relative to S) and/or higher inflow volumes to Michigan. This strict-first pattern reduces the immediate epidemic pressure by limiting the importation of infected and exposed individuals during critical early periods, which is crucial for minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Michigan. States with very high inflows and infection burdens, such as Ohio, Indiana, and Wisconsin, receive the strictest early restrictions, reflecting their outsized impact on Michigan's epidemic dynamics. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence and/or lower inflow adopt more balanced or even traffic distributions to maintain mobility while controlling risk. The underlying quantitative logic relies on the proportionality of imported infected individuals to Flow*ft*(I/S), where Flow is the state's daily inflow to Michigan, ft is the weekly fraction, I is infected count, and S is susceptible population. By adjusting ft weekly while keeping total Flow constant, the policy strategically shifts mobility to later weeks when infection pressure is expected to be lower or better managed. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more crucial to prevent epidemic surges. Conversely, lower prevalence or improved local controls in origin states could allow more relaxed early fractions. The recommended allocations thus balance epidemic containment with economic and social mobility needs across states and weeks, leveraging cross-state cooperation to minimize Michigan's cumulative epidemic burden effectively."

    "notes": "Alabama has a large susceptible population (~4.88M) with relatively low infected (I=385) and exposed (E=1306) individuals. The infected proportion is low compared to the population, so imported infections are moderate but the high daily inflow (8613.39) poses some risk. Imported infected approximately equals Flow*ft*(I/S+E+I+Q+R+D), roughly proportional to I/population times flow fraction ft. The infection pressure appears stable with no large spikes in cases, so an even allocation pattern is chosen to maintain consistent control without sudden mobility surges that might risk outbreaks. Trade-offs balance epidemic control (steady reduction of imported cases) with mobility needs (avoid over-restriction). Fractions add to exactly 1, validating the distribution."

The imported infected risk scales with the daily inflow (7239) and infected fraction. Given a slight decrease in infection trend, a strict-first pattern is adopted to reduce early week inflow, limiting initial spread and allowing time for local mitigation. The flow fractions are weighted heavier in the first two weeks to contain potential outbreaks early. This balances mobility constraints with epidemic control by front-loading restrictions.

The daily inflow is low (1178.5), but imported infected risk per traveler is higher. A strict-first pattern with higher restrictions initially (fraction 0.15 in week 4) reduces risk early, tapering traffic later as cases potentially decline.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocation for Michigan from each origin state collectively aims to minimize imported infections by adjusting weekly fractions while keeping total 4-week inflow constant. States with higher infection prevalence and/or higher inflow volumes adopt stricter measures early (strict-first pattern) to reduce immediate importation risk and allow local containment. Meanwhile, states with stable or low infection rates use even or relaxed-first patterns to maintain economic activity while controlling spread. This coordinated approach balances epidemic control and mobility across states and weeks. The imported infections roughly scale with Flow*ft*(I/Population), so reducing ft in weeks with higher infection prevalence or risk yields fewer new cases and deaths in Michigan. By distributing restrictions over time and states, we avoid overwhelming economic disruption while effectively controlling disease importation. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early-week controls become more critical to prevent rapid epidemic growth. Conversely, with lower prevalence or effective local interventions, fractions could be relaxed to increase mobility. Overall, this balanced, data-driven strategy leverages temporal and spatial heterogeneity in infection pressure to optimize traffic control policies that minimize COVID-19 impact in Michigan."

The imported infections are approximately proportional to Flow*ft*(I/S+E+I+Q+R+D), suggesting that controlling flow fractions can reduce imported cases. Given the stable infection level without significant increase or decrease, an even distribution (even pattern) of traffic control is chosen. This balances epidemic control with mobility needs, distributing traffic evenly to avoid sudden spikes in imported cases. The fractions sum to 1 exactly (0.25+0.25+0.25+0.25=1)."

  "global_guidance": "Across all origin states, the recommended traffic control policies aim to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Michigan by adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions while keeping the total 4-week flow constant per origin. States with higher infection prevalence or exposed populations relative to their susceptible population receive stricter early-week controls (strict-first pattern) to reduce immediate imported infection pressure. This is because imported infected individuals roughly scale with Flow*ft*(I/population), and reducing ft early lowers the risk of seeding new infections in Michigan. States with moderate or low infection prevalence and stable or declining trends adopt even or relaxed-first patterns, allowing mobility to gradually recover without triggering infection surges. The approach balances epidemic control and economic activity, avoiding severe restrictions that could impact mobility severely, while still managing infection risk effectively. The coordination across states leverages the staggered timing of traffic relaxations to smooth the overall imported infection load into Michigan, preventing clustered spikes. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls would be more beneficial. Conversely, if prevalence drops or vaccination coverage improves, relaxed patterns could be adopted earlier to enhance mobility. This policy is robust to moderate fluctuations in epidemic parameters and promotes a sustainable balance between public health and mobility demands."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocation employs a mix of strict-first, even, and relaxed-first patterns tailored to each origin state's epidemic risk profile. States with high infected and exposed populations relative to susceptible numbers (e.g., Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin) use strict-first patterns, reducing inbound flow heavily in early weeks to minimize imported infections and allow Michigan to control seeding events. Moderate risk states (e.g., Arkansas, Tennessee, South Carolina) also favor strict-first but with more gradual relaxation. Low risk or more stable prevalence states (e.g., Iowa, Nebraska, Texas) use even patterns to balance mobility and epidemic control. For some states with increasing or shifting risk (e.g., Idaho, Utah, New Mexico), relaxed-first patterns allow initial mobility while tightening controls in later weeks to address potential rising imported infection risk. This cross-state coordination balances the overall inflow to Michigan, keeping total flow constant per state but adjusting weekly fractions to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. By reducing early week flows from high-risk states, the model expects fewer imported infections, slowing Michigan's epidemic growth. The approach is quantitatively justified by approximating imported infections as Flow*ft*(I/S), where lowering ft in early weeks for high-risk states significantly reduces infection pressure. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become even more critical, while lower prevalence states can maintain more relaxed or even flow distributions. Overall, this policy balances epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs by dynamically tuning traffic restrictions by origin state and week, ensuring fractions sum precisely to 1 to maintain flow consistency and policy feasibility."

States with high infected and exposed populations relative to susceptible numbers (e.g., Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin) use strict-first patterns, reducing inbound flow heavily in early weeks to minimize imported infections and allow Michigan to control seeding events. Moderate risk states (e.g., Arkansas, Tennessee, South Carolina) also favor strict-first but with more gradual relaxation. Low risk or more stable prevalence states (e.g., Iowa, Nebraska, Texas) use even patterns to balance mobility and epidemic control. For some states with increasing or shifting risk (e.g., Idaho, Utah, New Mexico), relaxed-first patterns allow initial mobility while tightening controls in later weeks to address potential rising imported infection risk. This cross-state coordination balances the overall inflow to Michigan, keeping total flow constant per state but adjusting weekly fractions to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases.

The infection prevalence (I/S population) is relatively low but non-negligible. The inbound flow to Michigan from Alabama is moderate (~8854 daily). Expected imported infections can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / Population), indicating that each week's inbound traffic fraction ft proportionally affects imported infections. The infection pressure is stable without significant increasing or decreasing trend, so an even allocation pattern is chosen to balance epidemic control and mobility needs. This approach avoids sudden spikes or drops in traffic, maintaining consistent control measures. Trade-offs involve limiting the flow to prevent imported cases while supporting economic and social mobility. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

The infection prevalence is moderate. With a daily flow of about 11,711 into Michigan, imported infections scale as Flow * ft * (I / Population). Given the moderate but slightly decreasing infected numbers, a relaxed-first pattern is applied with higher fractions in the first two weeks (0.3 each) tapering to 0.2.

Given the risk of increasing infections, a strict-first pattern is recommended: lower inbound flow in week 1 (0.15) and gradually relaxed control later (0.25, 0.3, 0.3).

A relaxed-first pattern is chosen with 0.2 in week 1, increasing to 0.3 in week 2, then 0.25 for weeks 3 and 4, balancing early caution with later relaxation as infection data stabilizes.

A strict-first pattern with low initial fractions (0.1, 0.15) progressively relaxed (0.35, 0.4) is recommended to reduce immediate imported infections while allowing mobility to recover gradually. The trade-off involves significant early restrictions impacting travel but essential for epidemic control. Fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocations across states are designed to collectively reduce expected imported infections and deaths in Michigan by balancing infection prevalence and mobility demands. States with higher infection prevalence (I/population) and larger daily inflows receive stricter early controls (low fractions in weeks 1-2) to minimize immediate importation risk. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or smaller flows are allocated more even or relaxed-first patterns, allowing mobility while supervising risk. This cross-state coordination helps flatten incoming infection pressure over the 4 weeks, preventing spikes that could overwhelm Michigan's healthcare capacity. The allocation fractions always sum to one per state, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant, preserving travel volume but shifting timing to control risk. This temporal distribution leverages epidemic dynamics to reduce cumulative cases: stricter controls early reduce initial imported seeds, while gradual relaxation mitigates economic impact. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence rises or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more critical, implying that these fractions could shift toward even lower week-1 and week-2 values. Conversely, if epidemic conditions improve, allocations could be relaxed earlier. The model assumes consistent compliance and no sudden external shocks; deviations may require adaptive reallocation. Overall, this strategy balances epidemic control and societal mobility, optimizing inbound traffic timing to minimize Michigan's epidemic burden while maintaining essential travel."

The imported infected cases estimate scales as Flow*ft*(I/population), so uniform distribution avoids spikes in any single week. Given Alabama's moderate infection pressure and high inflow (6778 daily), an even pattern balances mobility and epidemic control effectively, preventing potential outbreaks from sudden influxes.

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic allocation from origin states to Michigan is designed to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically managing the timing of mobility. States with higher infection prevalence and larger inflow volumes, such as Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Texas, are assigned stricter controls during the initial weeks to reduce early importation pressure that could exacerbate Michigan's epidemic. This strict-first strategy helps delay and flatten potential surges, giving Michigan's health system time to respond and reducing overall transmission. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure or smaller inflow are managed with more even or mildly relaxed patterns to preserve necessary mobility and economic activity. The balancing across weeks and states reflects a risk-weighted approach: early weeks emphasize infection control when Michigan's own infection levels are still significant (I=6989, E=7371), and later weeks gradually relax restrictions as local immunity increases (R=56430) and deaths (D=6905) inform severity. Quantitatively, the policy minimizes the product of Flow*ft*(I/population) summed over states and weeks, effectively smoothing importation risk and avoiding concentrated spikes. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls would become more critical, especially from high inflow states. Conversely, if local Michigan epidemic improves rapidly, relaxation could be accelerated. This coordinated cross-state strategy optimizes epidemic control and mobility trade-offs, acknowledging stochastic uncertainties and the nonlinear dynamics of SEIQRD models. The exact fractions sum to 1 for each origin state, ensuring consistency and feasibility of traffic control implementation."

The imported infected estimate is proportional to Flow * f_t * (I / population), which is considerable given the daily inflow (~6931). The infection pressure is relatively stable but slightly elevated; thus, a strict-first pattern (lower fractions in early weeks) is chosen to minimize early imported infections and reduce transmission in Michigan’s vulnerable initial state. This approach balances epidemic control with mobility by gradually relaxing restrictions to allow economic and social activity later.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound flow fractions balance minimizing cumulative imported infections and deaths with maintaining vital mobility for economic and social needs. States with high infected counts and large flows like Ohio, Indiana, and Wisconsin adopt relaxation-first patterns to prevent overwhelming Michigan early while gradually allowing mobility. States with moderate or rising infection pressure use strict-first patterns to reduce early import risk, gradually relaxing to balance control and mobility. States with stable or low infection prevalence adopt even distributions to maintain steady risk and mobility. The total daily inbound flow per origin state remains constant by ensuring fractions sum exactly to 1.0, preserving baseline mobility volumes. This coordinated cross-state approach reduces Michigan's infection importation by temporally redistributing inbound flows, lowering early epidemic pressure and resultant deaths. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early reductions (lower initial fractions) would further reduce import risk, while if prevalence decreases, more relaxed patterns could be adopted to support mobility. Balancing epidemic control and mobility across states and weeks minimizes total disease burden while enabling essential movement."

States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to their total population have stricter controls in earlier weeks (strict-first pattern) to reduce the initial seeding of infections in Michigan. This front-loaded control aims to suppress early imported cases that could exponentially increase infections and deaths in Michigan. Conversely, states with lower current infection levels or more stable epidemic situations adopt even or relaxed-first patterns, allowing some relaxation initially or evenly distributing flow to support economic and social mobility without significant epidemic risk. The sum of fractions for each state is exactly one, preserving the total inbound flow volume but reshaping its temporal distribution. This cooperation logic enables risk balancing: weeks with higher infection pressure see stricter controls across multiple states, preventing cumulative overload. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls should be intensified. Conversely, if local Michigan epidemic conditions improve significantly, traffic restrictions may be gradually relaxed. The policy is adaptive, balancing imported infection risk against mobility needs while maintaining flow totals.

The imported infected cases into Michigan can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/Population). Given the daily inbound flow of 7595 and infection prevalence, controlling inflow evenly across weeks (even pattern) balances mobility and risk. Alabama's infection rate has not shown sharp increasing or decreasing trends, so strict front-loading or relaxation is not justified.

  "global_guidance": "To collectively minimize imported infections and deaths in Michigan, inbound traffic allocations are adjusted per origin state's infection prevalence, exposed population, and daily inflow volume. States with higher infected and exposed counts, especially with large inflow (e.g., Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin), have stricter initial controls with gradual relaxation, leveraging the incubation period and allowing Michigan's own epidemic curve to stabilize. States with low infection prevalence and moderate inflow are managed with even distributions to maintain mobility without sharp risk spikes. The cooperative approach balances weekly risk by shifting flows from early high-risk weeks to later weeks when Michigan's internal control improves, reducing cumulative imported infections. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early-week controls should be intensified, while if prevalence declines, more relaxed patterns could be considered. This dynamic allocation reduces peak importation risk and potential deaths, supporting epidemic control while maintaining essential mobility. All fractions are carefully calibrated to sum exactly to 1, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant per origin state."

States with higher infected and exposed counts, especially with large inflow (e.g., Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin), have stricter initial controls with gradual relaxation, leveraging the incubation period and allowing Michigan's own epidemic curve to stabilize. States with low infection prevalence and moderate inflow are managed with even distributions to maintain mobility without sharp risk spikes. The cooperative approach balances weekly risk by shifting flows from early high-risk weeks to later weeks when Michigan's internal control improves, reducing cumulative imported infections.

Given stable prevalence, an even distribution (equal fractions) avoids concentrating risk in any single week, reducing outbreak spikes.

  "global_guidance": "The overall inbound traffic allocation strategy for Michigan from multiple origin states is designed to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically managing the timing of traffic flows. The core principle is balancing epidemic control and mobility by shifting traffic away from weeks with higher infection pressure and concentrating flow in weeks with relatively lower prevalence. For states with high infection and exposed populations (e.g., South Carolina, Wisconsin, Idaho), a strict-first pattern is adopted, applying strong restrictions early to prevent seeding new infections in Michigan. For states with moderate or low infection pressure (e.g., Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota), an even distribution suffices, reducing unnecessary socioeconomic disruption. This cross-state cooperation reduces the cumulative imported infection risk, as the sum of imported infected cases scales with Flow * ft * (I/population) across all states and weeks. By front-loading restrictions on high-risk states and smoothing flows for lower-risk states, the policy balances the trade-off between controlling epidemic spread and preserving essential mobility and economic activity. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infected prevalence or transmission rate beta were higher, stricter front-loading would be warranted to mitigate exponential spread risks. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or effective vaccination increases, more relaxed and evenly distributed traffic controls may be feasible. The proposed fractions for each origin state sum exactly to 1, ensuring the total inbound flow remains constant while redistributing weekly proportions to minimize Michigan's epidemic burden effectively."
