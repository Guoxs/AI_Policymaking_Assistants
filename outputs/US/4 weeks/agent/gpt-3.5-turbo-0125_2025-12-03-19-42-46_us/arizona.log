  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic allocation strategy across all origin states aims to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Arizona by managing the importation pressure week by week. States with higher infection prevalence (high I and E relative to S) such as South Carolina, Idaho, Michigan, New Mexico, and Utah adopt stricter control during the first week with lower fractions, gradually relaxing controls in subsequent weeks. This staggered approach reduces the early influx of infected individuals, allowing Arizona's health system to better monitor and contain potential outbreaks. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or lower exposure risks adopt an even or relaxed-first pattern to sustain economic activity and mobility without significantly increasing imported infection risk. The total inbound flow from each state remains constant over the 4 weeks, preserving necessary mobility while redistributing risk temporally. Quantitatively, the expected number of imported infections in each week is approximated by multiplying each state's baseline flow, the weekly fraction, and the infected prevalence (I/population). By allocating stricter controls in high-risk periods and relaxing in lower-risk periods, the policy balances epidemic control and mobility demands. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become even more critical to prevent spikes. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, traffic can be more evenly distributed. This cooperative, data-informed allocation across states and weeks optimizes Arizona's epidemic management while maintaining vital interstate mobility."

States with higher infection prevalence (high I and E relative to S) such as South Carolina, Idaho, Michigan, New Mexico, and Utah adopt stricter control during the first week with lower fractions, gradually relaxing controls in subsequent weeks. This staggered approach reduces the early influx of infected individuals, allowing Arizona's health system to better monitor and contain potential outbreaks. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or lower exposure risks adopt an even or relaxed-first pattern to sustain economic activity and mobility without significantly increasing imported infection risk. The total inbound flow from each state remains constant over the 4 weeks, preserving necessary mobility while redistributing risk temporally. Quantitatively, the expected number of imported infections in each week is approximated by multiplying each state's baseline flow, the weekly fraction, and the infected prevalence (I/population). By allocating stricter controls in high-risk periods and relaxing in lower-risk periods, the policy balances epidemic control and mobility demands. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become even more critical to prevent spikes. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, traffic can be more evenly distributed.

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the allocation of inbound traffic fractions across origin states balances epidemic control and mobility by prioritizing stronger restrictions in early weeks for states with higher infection prevalence and high inbound flows, thus minimizing early importation of infected individuals into Arizona.

Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller flows have more even or relaxed-first patterns, allowing gradual mobility restoration. This balancing act leverages the epidemiological principle that imported infections early in the epidemic can seed larger outbreaks, so front-loading restrictions mitigates this risk. The cumulative flow over 4 weeks remains constant for each origin state, ensuring no overall reduction in mobility but temporal redistribution to minimize peak infection import risk. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls would yield larger benefits, while reductions in these parameters allow for more relaxed allocations. The approach also assumes that Arizona's internal epidemic control remains stable, so imported infections have proportional impact. Overall, this coordinated temporal and cross-state allocation reduces expected imported infections and subsequent cases and deaths in Arizona by smoothing and delaying infection pressure, enabling health systems to better manage caseloads and reducing epidemic peaks."

    "notes": "Alabama has a moderate number of infected individuals (I=457) relative to its population (S=4857550). The exposed (E=1468) and confirmed (Q=12883) numbers are not very high. The expected imported infections can be roughly estimated by Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)), which implies that inbound traffic should not be heavily restricted but rather evenly distributed to maintain mobility while controlling risk. Since the infection pressure does not show a clear increasing or decreasing trend, an even pattern is chosen, balancing epidemic control and mobility needs. The fractions sum exactly to 1, validating the distribution."

    "notes": "Arkansas has relatively higher infected individuals (I=1995) and exposed (E=3855) compared to its population size. This suggests a higher infection risk entering Arizona. The imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/population), so stricter controls early (lower fractions in later weeks) help reduce initial importation. The traffic allocation follows a strict-first pattern with higher fractions in the first two weeks, relaxing later as control measures and immunity build up. This balances the trade-off between minimizing early infection spikes and maintaining mobility. The fractions sum to 1 exactly."

The recent higher exposed population suggests a rising infection risk, thus a relaxed-first pattern is chosen to allow more traffic in the middle weeks when infection pressure might be lower. The formula Flow*ft*(I/population) supports adjusting fractions to reduce peak risk periods. This approach balances epidemic control and mobility by avoiding strict controls in all weeks, reducing economic impact. The fractions correctly sum to 1."

A relaxed-first pattern is adopted with fractions peaking mid-period, assuming transient reductions in infection prevalence.

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce expected imported infections and deaths in Arizona, traffic control policies distribute inbound flows by adjusting weekly fractions per origin state while keeping total flow constant. States with higher infection prevalence and exposed individuals, such as Michigan, Utah, and New Mexico, adopt relaxed-first patterns with stricter controls early to minimize initial infection importation and gradually relax controls as immunity builds and infection pressure potentially decreases. Conversely, states with increasing exposed populations but lower current infected counts, like Iowa, Mississippi, and Nebraska, employ strict-first patterns, concentrating restrictions in later weeks to preempt rising infection importation risks. States exhibiting stable or moderate infection levels, such as Alabama, Indiana, and Virginia, apply even traffic distributions to balance epidemic control and mobility demands. This approach leverages quantitative cooperation logic where high-risk states reduce importation early, and lower-risk states maintain mobility, collectively minimizing peak infection importation into Arizona. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early restrictions become more critical, especially for states with rising exposed populations. Conversely, if beta decreases or recovery rates improve, more relaxed allocations can be safely adopted without compromising epidemic control. This dynamic, data-driven traffic allocation framework strategically balances public health protection and mobility needs, reducing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Arizona, the overall inbound traffic policies strategically apply stricter controls in early weeks (strict-first pattern) for states with high infection prevalence (high I and E relative to S), such as Arkansas, Idaho, Michigan, New Mexico, Texas, and Utah. This reduces early importation of infected individuals when Arizona's susceptible population remains large and vulnerable, thus preventing exponential epidemic growth. For states with lower infection prevalence, even traffic distribution is used to balance epidemic control and mobility, avoiding unnecessary harsh restrictions that could harm economic activity. Quantitatively, the expected imported infected cases per week are proportional to Flow * ft * (I / population). By allocating lower fractions ft in early weeks for higher-risk states, we reduce the peak imported infection pressure, allowing Arizona's health system to cope better. Mobility is relaxed later in weeks 3 and 4, balancing social and economic needs. The fractions for each state sum exactly to 1, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant as per constraints. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence (I or E) increases, stricter early controls would be necessary, while if transmission rate beta decreases, somewhat relaxed controls could be tolerated. Cross-state coordination ensures that total inbound infection risk is spread over time and states, preventing synchronized surges that could overwhelm Arizona's control capacity. This balanced approach optimally trades off epidemic control and economic mobility, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths."

This front-loading of restrictions minimizes early importation of infected individuals, which is critical given the exponential nature of transmission. Gradual relaxation in subsequent weeks allows for necessary mobility and economic activity while keeping cumulative imported infections low. The quantitative cooperation logic relies on balancing the imported infection risk by scaling each week's flow according to the proportion of infectious individuals in the origin state population and the total inflow volume. States with higher prevalence and larger inflow receive stricter early reductions, while states with lower prevalence or inflow have more moderate restrictions. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early restrictions would be warranted to avoid surges. Conversely, if beta or prevalence decreases, the pattern could be relaxed with more even flow. This strategy balances epidemic control and mobility needs, minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Arizona over the next month."

This even pattern is chosen because Alabama's infection level is stable and not showing trends that would justify front-loading or back-loading restrictions.

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy for Arizona's inbound traffic control balances epidemic control with mobility needs by adjusting weekly fractions per origin state based on their infection pressure relative to population and total inbound flow. States with higher infection prevalence (I/population), such as Utah, Idaho, Tennessee, and Michigan, receive stricter controls early in the 4-week period (strict-first or relaxed-first patterns) to prevent seeding new infections and deaths within Arizona. This front-loading of restrictions minimizes early imported infections, which have a compounding effect on local outbreaks. States with lower infection pressure, like Alabama, Iowa, and Mississippi, are assigned even traffic distributions to sustain mobility without significantly increasing risk. The total inbound flow from each origin state over 4 weeks remains constant by design, preserving economic and social connections while controlling timing. Quantitatively, imported infected cases approximate Flow * ft * (I/population), guiding fraction adjustments; lower fractions reduce weekly imported infections. The coordinated approach acts like a temporal risk balancing, where stricter controls in high-risk weeks for some states are offset by relaxed flows in others, smoothing the overall importation risk to Arizona. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase in key origin states, stricter early controls become even more critical to prevent exponential growth in Arizona. Conversely, if prevalence drops, more even or relaxed patterns could be adopted to enhance mobility safely. This dynamic allocation ensures epidemic control measures are both targeted and adaptive, maximizing health benefits while minimizing economic disruption."

The total inbound flow from each origin state over 4 weeks remains constant by design, preserving economic and social connections while controlling timing. Quantitatively, imported infected cases approximate Flow * ft * (I/population), guiding fraction adjustments; lower fractions reduce weekly imported infections. The coordinated approach acts like a temporal risk balancing, where stricter controls in high-risk weeks for some states are offset by relaxed flows in others, smoothing the overall importation risk to Arizona. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase in key origin states, stricter early controls become even more critical to prevent exponential growth in Arizona. Conversely, if prevalence drops, more even or relaxed patterns could be adopted to enhance mobility safely. This dynamic allocation ensures epidemic control measures are both targeted and adaptive, maximizing health benefits while minimizing economic disruption."

  "global_guidance": "The collective allocation of inbound flow fractions across origin states is designed to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Arizona by strategically reducing imported infections during periods of higher infection prevalence in origin states. The core reasoning relies on the epidemiological principle that imported infections are proportional to the inbound flow multiplied by the proportion of infectious individuals (I/population) in the origin state and modulated by traffic control fractions (ft). By adopting predominantly strict-first patterns for states with higher infection prevalence (e.g., Arkansas, Idaho, Michigan, Texas, Utah), the policy suppresses early high-risk travel, thereby reducing immediate introduction of infections into Arizona when Arizona's epidemic might be vulnerable. Conversely, a relaxed-first or even pattern is applied to states with moderate or lower infection prevalence to allow some level of economic activity without significantly increasing risk. This staggered approach balances epidemic control with mobility needs. Quantitatively, the sum of fractions per state is constrained to exactly 1, preserving the total inbound flow volume but redistributing it weekly to impose stricter controls during peak risk periods. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence (I/population) or transmission rate beta were higher, stricter early week restrictions would yield greater benefits by lowering imported cases. Conversely, if prevalence or beta decreases, the allocation could be relaxed without compromising control. The coordinated policy thus leverages temporal and cross-state infection dynamics to strategically allocate traffic controls, optimizing disease suppression in Arizona while accommodating mobility and economic considerations."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policy for Arizona's inbound traffic strategically balances epidemic control and mobility across the 19 origin states. Across states, the allocation patterns consider infection prevalence (I) relative to population size and average inflows. States with high infected counts and/or large inflows, such as Texas, Idaho, New Mexico, Utah, and Michigan, adopt strict-first patterns to reduce early importation risk, which is critical to prevent exponential growth in Arizona. This approach front-loads restrictions when importation risk is highest, then gradually relaxes controls to allow economic and social activity. Conversely, states with moderate or lower infection pressures use even or relaxed-first patterns to maintain steady mobility while controlling disease spread, ensuring no abrupt mobility changes that might cause spikes. The fractions for each state sum exactly to 1, satisfying the total flow conservation constraint. Quantitatively, expected imported infections approximate Flow*ft*(I/population), so adjusting the weekly fractions modulates this risk dynamically. Cooperation across states distributes control efforts, avoiding overwhelming Arizona's health system with imported cases in any single week. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence rises or the transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls become more crucial, whereas if prevalence falls, more relaxed patterns may be acceptable. Overall, this coordinated approach minimizes cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by targeting importation risk windows, balancing public health and mobility needs."

  "global_guidance": "The overall inbound traffic control strategy for Arizona prioritizes minimizing early imported infections and deaths by adopting primarily strict-first traffic allocation patterns for most origin states with moderate to high infection prevalence and inflow. This approach reduces the initial epidemic pressure on Arizona, allowing its healthcare system to better manage cases and limit transmission chains. States with lower infection prevalence or lower relative inflow use more even traffic allocations to sustain essential mobility and economic activity with limited epidemic risk. The total traffic inflow from each origin state remains constant across the 4 weeks, ensuring no unintended reduction in total mobility but shifting its timing to flatten importation peaks. Quantitatively, imported infections approximately follow imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/S), so reducing fractions ft in weeks with higher infection prevalence or greater risk can effectively reduce cumulative cases. Cross-state risk balancing is achieved by allocating stricter controls to states with both higher infected/exposed ratios and large inflows, while states with low infection pressure maintain consistent traffic. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence increases or transmission rate beta rises, stricter front-loading restrictions become more critical to prevent importation surges. Conversely, if prevalence drops or beta decreases, allocations could be relaxed earlier to enhance mobility. This adaptive, data-driven approach aligns with Arizona's epidemic control goals by balancing mobility needs and minimizing imported infections and deaths from multiple origin states."

The risk of importing infections is proportional to the inbound flow multiplied by the fraction and the infected proportion (I/(S+E+I+R+D+Q)). Alabama's daily average inbound flow to Arizona is 4002. Given this, we allocate stricter control early (f1=0.15) to reduce initial imported infections when Arizona's own infection is moderate. The relaxed-first pattern (increasing fractions) is chosen to allow mobility later when Arizona's outbreak may be controlled. This balances epidemic control and economic/social mobility.

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy balances strict early control with gradual relaxation over four weeks to minimize imported infections and deaths in Arizona. States with higher infected and exposed populations and larger inflows receive stricter early traffic reductions (lower week 1 fractions), reflecting higher importation risk proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population). This timing allows Arizona to reduce outbreak growth from imported cases during the initial critical period when its own infection prevalence is moderate. Lowering inbound flows early directly reduces imported infectious individuals and thus secondary cases and deaths, given the epidemic dynamics (beta, alpha, gamma, mu). States with lower infection pressure or smaller flows have milder restrictions to maintain essential mobility. The pattern chosen is mostly strict-first or relaxed-first depending on the origin state's risk profile and flow magnitude, optimizing both epidemic control and mobility needs. This coordinated approach balances weekly importation risk across all origin states, preventing simultaneous high inflows from multiple high-risk states. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter initial reductions are even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, relaxation can be accelerated. Overall, these allocations maintain the total inbound flow over 4 weeks constant per origin but re-distribute weekly fractions to flatten imported infection curves, thus minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Arizona. The fractions for all states sum exactly to 1, ensuring consistency."

The traffic flow fractions increase gradually over the four weeks to allow for some relaxation, preserving economic and social mobility. This temporal balancing reduces the risk of overwhelming Arizona's health system while avoiding excessive prolonged economic disruption. Quantitatively, imported infections scale with the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/S), so adjusting ft allows managing the temporal distribution of risk without changing total flow volume. Cross-state coordination is implicit, as all origin states apply similar strict-first patterns, focusing more restriction on states with higher I/S ratios or large inflows, such as Michigan, Texas, Utah, and New Mexico. The policy is sensitive to changes in prevalence or transmission rates: if prevalence rises, stricter early controls become more critical; if beta decreases (due to vaccination or behavioral changes), some relaxation could be considered earlier. Overall, this coordinated, temporally phased approach minimizes cumulative cases and deaths in Arizona by flattening imported infection waves while maintaining essential mobility."

The imported infected estimate roughly follows: imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/S). Given the inbound flow of 3756 daily, the expected infected inflow is significant. We opt for a strict-first pattern by reducing traffic more in the early weeks (f1=0.30, f2=0.25) to curb initial imported infections, then slightly relaxing later weeks as local controls and immunity build up. The pattern balances epidemic control and mobility, minimizing overall disease importation while allowing some economic activity. The fractions sum precisely to 1."

This approach minimizes the early introduction of infected individuals, which is critical for controlling the epidemic growth in Arizona. The strategy balances epidemiological risk and mobility needs by modulating the flow fractions based on each origin state's infection pressure (I and E relative to susceptible population) and inbound flow volume. High prevalence states with large inflows (e.g., Idaho, Michigan, Texas, Utah, New Mexico) tend to have relaxed-first or moderate patterns to avoid overwhelming local control, while states with moderate to lower prevalence generally follow strict-first or even patterns to reduce early seeding. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections are proportional to Flow*ft*(I/S), so reducing ft early for high-risk states sharply lowers early infection importation. The cooperative balancing of traffic restrictions prevents peak importation surges and distributes risk over the 4-week horizon. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become even more critical; conversely, if prevalence declines or immunity increases, more relaxation is feasible. This dynamic allocation allows adaptive epidemic control while sustaining essential mobility and economic functions."

This dynamic allocation allows adaptive epidemic control while sustaining essential mobility and economic functions."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce imported infections and deaths in Arizona, we allocate inbound traffic from all origin states by considering their infection prevalence (I and E) relative to population and their inbound flow volumes. The traffic fractions ft for each week are chosen to preserve total 4-week flow while modulating weekly risk. States with higher infection pressure and inbound flows (e.g., Arkansas, Idaho, New Mexico, Utah, Texas) have stricter controls earlier (lower ft) to reduce initial seeding risk in Arizona, with gradual relaxation later as local epidemic conditions stabilize. Lower-risk states with smaller infected or exposed populations or smaller flows (e.g., Kentucky, Virginia, Nebraska) maintain even traffic distribution to balance mobility and control without undue restrictions. This cooperative allocation smooths risk over weeks and states, preventing concentrated importation peaks that could overwhelm Arizona's control efforts. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls would be even more critical to prevent spikes. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta is lower, more uniform or relaxed allocations are possible. This approach balances epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs, aiming to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Arizona while maintaining essential interstate travel."

  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic control policy for Arizona's inbound flow from all origin states aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically allocating traffic across the next four weeks. The core principle is to modulate weekly traffic fractions (ft) so that total inbound flow remains constant per origin state, but the timing of importations is optimized to reduce epidemic pressure. States with higher infection prevalence and exposed populations, such as Idaho, Michigan, Tennessee, and Utah, receive stricter controls earlier (strict-first pattern) to curb early importation risks when Arizona's own epidemic is sensitive to additional cases. Conversely, states with stable or lower infection rates, like Alabama, Iowa, Minnesota, and Virginia, have even traffic allocations to maintain balanced mobility without compromising control. Several states (Nebraska, Idaho, Utah) adopt a relaxed-first pattern, imposing stricter early controls to mitigate import risk but allowing more flexibility later as local and imported cases hopefully decline. This staggered approach distributes epidemic risk over time, preventing spikes that could overwhelm Arizona's healthcare system. Quantitatively, expected imported infections scale approximately with the product of inbound flow, weekly fraction, and infected proportion in the origin state (Flow*ft*(I/population)). By adjusting ft, we reduce importation when infection prevalence is high or local conditions are vulnerable. The policy balances trade-offs between epidemic control and economic mobility: strict early reductions may delay necessary movement but reduce cases and deaths, while relaxed later weeks support economic recovery. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases in certain states, stricter early controls (lower ft) should be intensified accordingly. Conversely, if local Arizona immunity (recovered R) rises or prevalence decreases, traffic allocations can be relaxed to support mobility. This coordinated multi-state approach, respecting total flow constraints, strategically minimizes imported infections and associated morbidity and mortality in Arizona over the next month."

States with higher infection prevalence (high I and E relative to population) and high inflows receive stricter traffic control in early weeks (strict-first pattern) to reduce initial seeding into Arizona, thereby minimizing cumulative cases and deaths. States with lower or stable infection prevalence apply even or relaxed-first patterns to allow more mobility with controlled risk. Quantitatively, imported infected cases scale roughly with Flow*ft*(I/Pop), so shifting more traffic to later weeks when infection pressure might decline or be better managed can reduce peak epidemic burden. The sum of fractions per state equals exactly 1.000 to preserve total inbound flow and maintain fairness. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases in an origin state, stricter early controls (lower f1, f2) should be adopted to mitigate risk, whereas lower beta or prevalence allows more relaxed traffic. Coordination across states ensures that restrictions are not overly concentrated in one week or on a few states, spreading epidemic risk reduction evenly over time and geography. This approach minimizes cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Arizona while balancing mobility needs and economic considerations.'

Even patterns apply to states with stable, moderate infection levels to balance epidemic control and economic activity evenly. The quantitative logic relies on approximating imported infections as proportional to the product of flow, fraction, and infection prevalence (I/population). By shaping the fractions ft over weeks 1 to 4 to sum to 1, the total inbound flow remains constant, preserving mobility volume but redistributing temporal risk. This cooperation across states balances early epidemic control to reduce immediate imported infections with economic considerations of mobility needs. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence in origin states rises or the transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become more critical to prevent imported outbreaks in Arizona. Conversely, if prevalence falls, relaxation can be accelerated. The policy is adaptive and balances epidemic and economic trade-offs, with weekly fraction patterns tailored to origin states' epidemiological status to optimize Arizona's overall risk mitigation."

    "notes": "Alabama shows moderate infected (I=385) and exposed (E=1306) relative to its population (about 4.88 million susceptible). The imported infected cases approximately scale with Flow * ft * (I / population). Given the high average daily inflow (~3869), limiting flow early when infections can impact Arizona most is prudent. The chosen pattern is 'strict-first' with fractions front-loaded to weeks 1 and 2 lower (0.30 each) and relaxed later (0.20 each). This delays peak imported infection risk, allowing Arizona to control internal spread better. The trade-off sacrifices some early mobility to reduce early seeding but relaxes later to accommodate economic activity. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

Even pattern avoids sharp restrictions that might cause unintended mobility shifts. Expected imported infections scale similarly with Flow * ft * (I/population).

  "global_guidance": "Arizona faces importation risks from 19 origin states with varying infection prevalence and inflow volumes. The recommendations emphasize a strategic distribution of inbound traffic fractions over the next 4 weeks to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. States with high infection prevalence (I and E) and large inflows, such as New Mexico, Texas, Utah, Idaho, and Michigan, are assigned 'relaxed-first' patterns, restricting early weeks more to delay infection seeding and then gradually relaxing to preserve economic activity. This front-loading of restrictions helps Arizona reduce imported infections when its internal epidemic is vulnerable.

States with lower infection prevalence or inflows, such as Kentucky, Nebraska, and South Carolina, are assigned even distributions to avoid unnecessary disruption. The quantitative logic underlying these patterns is that imported infections approximately scale as Flow * ft * (I / population), so reducing early ft for high-risk states delays importation and reduces early epidemic growth. The trade-offs consider economic impacts of mobility reductions versus public health benefits. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence increases or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early restrictions would be warranted, while lower prevalence would allow more balanced or even relaxed patterns. Coordinated inter-state adjustments ensure that total inbound flows remain constant, preserving overall mobility volume while redistributing timing to optimize epidemic outcomes.

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocations prioritize early-week strict controls for states with higher infection prevalence (I/population) and significant flow to Arizona, such as Idaho, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, Tennessee, Utah, and Texas, to minimize the initial importation of infectious individuals when Arizona's susceptible population is still large. This strict-first pattern in high-risk origin states reduces the seeding of new cases and deaths in Arizona's population. For states with lower infection prevalence or smaller flows, an even or relaxed-first pattern balances epidemic control and economic mobility, avoiding excessive restrictions where risk is lower. The total inbound flow over four weeks remains constant per origin state, meeting the constraint, with fractions summing exactly to 1 to ensure flow conservation. This coordinated approach leverages quantitative risk assessment using the formula imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), focusing control efforts in weeks with the highest infection pressure. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls or longer durations of restriction may be warranted to keep importations low. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed allocations can be safely applied. Balancing these factors reduces cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Arizona by minimizing imported infections while preserving essential mobility and economic activity."
