  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies for Alabama's inbound traffic from origin states strategically balance epidemic control and mobility preservation by adjusting weekly traffic fractions while keeping total flow constant. States with higher infection prevalence and large flows, such as Mississippi, Tennessee, and Arkansas, adopt strict-first patterns, applying stronger restrictions in the initial week to curb early importation of infections, which reduces downstream confirmed and deceased cases. Conversely, states with low infection prevalence or lower flow, such as Iowa, Nebraska, and Wisconsin, use relaxed-first or even patterns to sustain economic activity while maintaining manageable epidemic risk. The weekly fractions sum precisely to 1 for each origin state, ensuring total flow remains unchanged while redistributing temporal flow to optimize control. This cooperative approach balances risk by distributing flow away from high infection pressure periods, smoothing potential infection surges. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence rises or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early-week controls become more critical to prevent overwhelming local healthcare. Conversely, if disease parameters improve or prevalence decreases, more relaxed patterns may be justified to support economic recovery.

States with higher infection prevalence and large flows, such as Mississippi, Tennessee, and Arkansas, adopt strict-first patterns, applying stronger restrictions in the initial week to curb early importation of infections, which reduces downstream confirmed and deceased cases. Conversely, states with low infection prevalence or lower flow, such as Iowa, Nebraska, and Wisconsin, use relaxed-first or even patterns to sustain economic activity while maintaining manageable epidemic risk. The weekly fractions sum precisely to 1 for each origin state, ensuring total flow remains unchanged while redistributing temporal flow to optimize control. This cooperative approach balances risk by distributing flow away from high infection pressure periods, smoothing potential infection surges. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence rises or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early-week controls become more critical to prevent overwhelming local healthcare. Conversely, if disease parameters improve or prevalence decreases, more relaxed patterns may be justified to support economic recovery. Overall, these allocations collectively minimize imported infections, reducing cumulative cases and deaths in Alabama while respecting mobility demands and economic considerations."

States with higher infected proportions and larger inbound flows, such as Mississippi, Tennessee, and Idaho, received stricter traffic control early (strict-first pattern), reducing initial imported infections when the epidemic risk is highest. In contrast, states with low infection prevalence such as Arizona, Iowa, Nebraska, Virginia, and Wisconsin have even traffic allocations to maintain steady mobility without unnecessary restrictions. This cooperation logic ensures that the total imported infections are smoothed over the 4-week horizon, preventing spikes that could overwhelm Alabama's healthcare system. The strict-first pattern delays peak imported cases to later weeks, allowing time for local interventions and monitoring. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases in origin states, even stricter early controls would be needed to prevent surges. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, traffic restrictions could be relaxed earlier. Balancing epidemic control and economic mobility, the chosen allocations maintain total flow constant per origin state over 4 weeks, satisfying constraints and enabling predictable travel volumes. This coordinated approach minimizes cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Alabama by limiting imported infections from high-risk states while preserving essential mobility from lower-risk origins."

  "global_guidance": "The traffic allocations across origin states prioritize early-week restrictions for states with higher infection and exposure ratios to Alabama, like Tennessee, Michigan, Arkansas, and Ohio, to minimize imported infections during peak risk periods. States with lower infection pressure or smaller inbound flows, such as Utah and Arizona, maintain even traffic control to balance mobility and epidemic control without excessive disruption. The relaxed-first pattern, prevalent in many states, allows stricter control when imported infection risk is highest and gradually relaxes measures as local and external epidemic pressures decline or stabilize, balancing economic and social mobility needs. The total inbound flow from each origin state remains constant over 4 weeks, ensuring no overall reduction in mobility but temporal redistribution to reduce epidemic peaks. Quantitatively, imported infections scale approximately as Flow * ft * (I / population), so reducing ft in early weeks for high-risk states cuts early importations that could seed local outbreaks. Cooperation among states is crucial, as easing restrictions simultaneously across multiple high-risk states would amplify imported cases. Sensitivity analysis shows that if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls would be more critical. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, traffic fractions could be more evenly distributed. This policy thus dynamically balances epidemic risk and mobility demands, minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Alabama through coordinated temporal traffic control."

The total inbound flow from each origin state remains constant over 4 weeks, ensuring no overall reduction in mobility but temporal redistribution to reduce epidemic peaks. Quantitatively, imported infections scale approximately as Flow * ft * (I / population), so reducing ft in early weeks for high-risk states cuts early importations that could seed local outbreaks. Cooperation among states is crucial, as easing restrictions simultaneously across multiple high-risk states would amplify imported cases. Sensitivity analysis shows that if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls would be more critical. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, traffic fractions could be more evenly distributed. This policy thus dynamically balances epidemic risk and mobility demands, minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Alabama through coordinated temporal traffic control.'

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Alabama, this policy balances inbound traffic flow proportionally across four weeks for each origin state while keeping total flow constant. States with higher infection prevalence (I) relative to their population and higher exposed (E) receive stricter controls in early and late weeks (strict-first pattern) to reduce initial seeding and tail-end importation risks. States with lower or moderate infection levels with stable prevalence adopt even or relaxed-first patterns to maintain essential mobility. The imported infected cases approximately follow the formula Imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / Population), guiding allocation of traffic fractions (ft). This approach smooths imported infections over time, preventing surges that can overwhelm Alabama's healthcare system. Trade-offs between epidemic control and economic activity are carefully considered, applying tighter restrictions when infection pressure is highest and relaxing when lower or when surveillance can adapt. The cooperation among states distributes infection risk temporally and spatially, reducing aggregate importation. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increase, stricter and more front-loaded controls would be necessary to prevent rapid spread. Conversely, if prevalence falls or beta decreases due to vaccination or NPIs, traffic control could relax to support economic recovery. This policy framework is adaptive and can be updated with real-time data to optimize epidemic and mobility outcomes."

The expected imported infections scale roughly as inflow * fraction * (I / population), which is small given the moderate inflow of 2656. Given fairly stable infection levels, an even distribution pattern is chosen to balance mobility and control.

Expected imported infected cases scale as inflow * fraction * (I/pop). To reduce risk early, a strict-first approach is used with lower fractions in later weeks. Early weeks have stricter control (more traffic reduction) to limit initial importation, gradually relaxing as monitoring improves.

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy balances the importation risk from each origin state into Alabama by adjusting weekly traffic allocations while keeping total 4-week inbound flow constant. States with high infection prevalence and large inflows such as Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Kentucky receive stricter early-week controls to reduce initial imported infections, lowering seeding risk in Alabama. This frontloaded control helps prevent early epidemic acceleration. In contrast, states with lower infection prevalence or lower inflows, such as Iowa, Nebraska, and Minnesota, have even distributions, maintaining steady mobility without compromising control. Relaxed-first patterns are applied to states like Idaho, Michigan, New Mexico, and Utah, where infection levels and inflows suggest some flexibility in early mobility with tightening mid-period to adapt to potential changes. This staggered, state-specific approach minimizes cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by controlling peak imported infection pressure and spreading restrictions over time, reducing strain on Alabama's healthcare. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase in a source state, stricter early-week controls would be warranted to counter rising importation risk. Conversely, if beta or prevalence decreases, restrictions can be relaxed earlier to support economic activity. The cooperative allocation across states ensures cumulative flow stays constant while smoothing importation risk temporally and spatially, optimizing epidemic control and mobility."

Given a moderate level of infection, a relaxed-first pattern with gradually increasing traffic control in later weeks is chosen to allow some mobility early but tighten controls as cumulative risks build, especially considering the relatively high confirmed cases (Q=107520). This balances economic activity while reducing the lagged risk of imported cases. The fractions sum to 1.0 exactly, ensuring no net change in total flow but temporal redistribution."

    "notes": "Arkansas exhibits a relatively high exposed (5190) and infected (2832) population relative to its size (~2.9 million susceptible). The daily inflow to Alabama is ~6841, which combined with the higher infection prevalence, suggests a significant importation risk. A strict-first pattern is employed with lower fractions in weeks 3 and 4 to reduce risk accumulation over time, prioritizing early flow to balance economic needs. The rationale is to front-load travel to better monitor and control spread early while gradually tightening restrictions to reduce later risks. This approach helps reduce cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Alabama. The fractions sum to 1.0 ensuring full allocation."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations for Alabama from each origin state are designed to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by balancing epidemic risk and mobility needs over the next four weeks. States with higher infection prevalence (high I and E relative to population) and significant inbound flow have stricter traffic controls earlier (strict-first pattern), reducing early importation pressure when the epidemic can grow exponentially. This front-loading of controls helps Alabama prevent surges in imported infections and deaths. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or lower inflow have even or relaxed-first patterns to maintain essential mobility and economic activities without significantly increasing risk. The total flow from each origin state remains constant over the four weeks to respect baseline mobility demands, but temporal redistribution of traffic flows (fractions summing exactly to 1) allows optimizing the timing of flows to reduce disease spread. The cooperation logic leverages the multiplicative effect of infection prevalence and flow; by reducing flow fractions in weeks where risk is higher, the overall imported infected cases decrease substantially. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter controls earlier become more critical to avoid exponential growth. Conversely, lower prevalence or beta can allow more relaxed patterns. These policies collectively reduce Alabamas imported cases and deaths while balancing economic and social needs, by controlling when and how much traffic arrives from each origin state based on their epidemic status and flow volumes."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocations prioritize reducing imported infections from states with the highest infection prevalence and inflow to Alabama. States with large infected populations and high inflow, such as Tennessee, Mississippi, and Texas, have adopted relaxed-first patterns with stricter early controls to mitigate initial importation risk and gradually relax controls as Alabama's local epidemic control strengthens. In contrast, states with moderate infection levels and inflow, like Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, use strict-first patterns to lower early and late importation risk while balancing mobility mid-period. States with lower infection prevalence or inflow, such as Iowa, Nebraska, and Wisconsin, implement even traffic reductions to maintain consistent epidemic control without excessive economic disruption. This cooperative risk balancing across weeks and states ensures that cumulative imported infections and deaths are minimized in Alabama by flattening the importation risk curve over time, preventing large spikes in imported cases. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases in any origin state, stricter early traffic controls should be intensified to reduce importation risk. Conversely, if local Alabama epidemic control improves, later weeks can tolerate relaxed inflow fractions to support mobility. Overall, this strategy balances epidemic control with economic considerations dynamically and proportionally to origin state risk profiles, optimizing Alabama's public health outcomes."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Alabama, the allocation of inbound traffic fractions for each origin state strategically balances epidemic control and mobility. States with high infection prevalence (high I and E relative to population), such as Idaho, Utah, Michigan, Tennessee, and Wisconsin, adopt a relaxed-first pattern that starts with stricter controls in early weeks, gradually relaxing to allow economic recovery while preventing early seeding of infections. States with moderate to high infection levels but very large populations (Arizona, Texas, Ohio) also follow a relaxed-first approach to balance risk and mobility. Conversely, states with very high infection rates and relatively smaller populations or large inbound flows (Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee) apply a strict-first pattern, emphasizing stronger early restrictions to prevent importation spikes. States with low or stable infection levels (Iowa, Virginia, Nebraska) use an even traffic allocation pattern for steady control and mobility. This cross-state approach distributes inbound flow restrictions temporally and spatially, reducing the likelihood of overwhelming Alabama's healthcare capacity. Quantitatively, imported infections are proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), so adjusting ft values over weeks allows risk smoothing. By concentrating stricter control in early weeks for high-risk states and relaxing later, the policy reduces the probability of early outbreaks. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter or more front-loaded controls would be needed to maintain effectiveness, while lower prevalence allows more uniform flow. This cooperative allocation ensures that the total inbound flow volume per state remains constant over four weeks, preserving economic activity while minimizing epidemic risk. The balanced allocation across states and weeks accounts for their varying epidemic pressures and mobility volumes, optimizing Alabama's public health outcomes."

The infected fraction (I/pop) is low, reducing risk of imported infections. The expected imported infections approximate Flow * ft * (I/pop), so reducing flow proportion in earlier weeks helps limit imported infections. The allocation follows a strict-first pattern, with lower fractions in weeks 1 and 2 to mitigate initial importation risk when overall Alabama prevalence is still high, gradually relaxing control as local conditions improve. This balances epidemic control and mobility, minimizing spread risk while preserving some economic activity. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocation policies across origin states aim to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Alabama by strategically adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions while maintaining constant total flow over 4 weeks. States with higher infected and exposed prevalence relative to their populations and with high inflow volumes (e.g., Mississippi, Tennessee, South Carolina, Idaho) adopt a relaxed-first pattern, imposing stricter controls in early weeks to reduce initial imported infection pressure when Alabama's local epidemic is still active. This reduces risk of seeding new cases and overwhelms local health systems. States with moderate or low infection prevalence or lower flow volumes tend to use even distributions to maintain stable mobility without creating spikes in imported infections. Some large states with significant inflows and moderate infection prevalence (e.g., Michigan, Ohio, Texas, Arizona) employ strict-first patterns, reducing travel early to contain importations, then gradually relaxing controls to balance epidemic control with economic needs. The quantitative cooperation logic balances risks across weeks and states, ensuring that total inbound infections imported from all origins are spread to avoid overwhelming Alabama's healthcare capacity. Adjusting weekly fractions allows temporal risk smoothing, preventing compounding peaks. Sensitivity analysis indicates effectiveness depends on accurate prevalence estimates and transmission rates (beta). If prevalence or beta increases, stricter controls may be needed earlier or longer. Conversely, if local control improves, traffic can be relaxed sooner.

States with higher infected and exposed prevalence relative to their populations and with high inflow volumes (e.g., Mississippi, Tennessee, South Carolina, Idaho) adopt a relaxed-first pattern, imposing stricter controls in early weeks to reduce initial imported infection pressure when Alabama's local epidemic is still active. This reduces risk of seeding new cases and overwhelms local health systems. States with moderate or low infection prevalence or lower flow volumes tend to use even distributions to maintain stable mobility without creating spikes in imported infections. Some large states with significant inflows and moderate infection prevalence (e.g., Michigan, Ohio, Texas, Arizona) employ strict-first patterns, reducing travel early to contain importations, then gradually relaxing controls to balance epidemic control with economic needs. The quantitative cooperation logic balances risks across weeks and states, ensuring that total inbound infections imported from all origins are spread to avoid overwhelming Alabama's healthcare capacity. Adjusting weekly fractions allows temporal risk smoothing, preventing compounding peaks. Sensitivity analysis indicates effectiveness depends on accurate prevalence estimates and transmission rates (beta). If prevalence or beta increases, stricter controls may be needed earlier or longer. Conversely, if local control improves, traffic can be relaxed sooner. This dynamic, data-driven approach optimizes epidemic control while preserving essential mobility and economic functions."

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic control policies for Alabama strategically balance epidemic control and mobility by adjusting weekly flow fractions per origin state based on their infection pressure and population sizes. States with high infected and exposed counts relative to their population, such as Tennessee, Mississippi, Indiana, Michigan, and South Carolina, adopt strict-first patterns with stronger early controls to minimize initial importation risk when Alabama's own infection levels are still significant. This approach reduces the chance of triggering secondary outbreaks. States with moderate or low infection prevalence generally have even or relaxed-first patterns, allowing more mobility in later weeks when Alabama's situation may improve and healthcare capacity can better absorb imported cases. The total inbound flow over four weeks remains constant per state to maintain overall traffic volume and economic activity, but weekly distributions are optimized to reduce cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Alabama. Quantitatively, imported infections roughly scale with inbound flow times the fraction for the week times the infected proportion in the origin state (Flow*ft*(I/population)). By allocating lower fractions in weeks when imported infection risk is higher, and higher fractions when risk is lower or local conditions improve, the policy effectively lowers the expected imported infections. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become more critical, whereas if these decrease, mobility can be relaxed earlier. Cross-state cooperation is essential as the combined importation risk depends on all origin states; therefore, balancing import flows weekly across states prevents overwhelming Alabama's healthcare system. This coordinated temporal and spatial allocation of inbound traffic flow is key to minimizing epidemic impact while sustaining necessary mobility."

The exposed (E=2909) and confirmed (Q=59,094) are also substantial, indicating ongoing transmission risk. The imported infected flow can be approximated by Flow * ft * (I/S), meaning that controlling ft in weeks of higher prevalence reduces infection import. Given a moderately high prevalence and exposure, a relaxed-first pattern is chosen to allow more flow in later weeks, reflecting potential epidemic decline or better control measures over time. This pattern balances the trade-off of economic needs and epidemic control by initially restricting travel, then relaxing it. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.20 + 0.25 + 0.30 + 0.25 = 1.00), ensuring total flow remains consistent."

This suggests the need for stricter early control to minimize immediate importation of cases. The imported infections are proportional to Flow * ft * (I/S), so lowering ft initially reduces risk. Therefore, a strict-first pattern is adopted, with higher restrictions in the first two weeks and gradual relaxation later. This approach prioritizes epidemic control early, which is critical given Arkansas's higher infection prevalence. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.35 + 0.30 + 0.20 + 0.15 = 1.00), preserving total flow."

Given the relatively moderate infection prevalence (I/population ~0.000156) and a significant daily inflow to Alabama, the imported infected cases can be approximated by Flow*ft*(I/Pop). Spreading the inbound traffic with a relaxed-first pattern (gradually increasing flow in weeks 3 and 4) balances mobility needs and epidemic control. Early weeks have stricter controls (lower fractions) to reduce immediate imported risk, while later weeks relax controls as the state may improve or Alabama's local control improves. This pattern mitigates early importation of infections while allowing gradual resumption of mobility. Trade-offs include some economic and social constraints early on, balanced against health benefits. The fractions sum to exactly 1.00."

The daily inflow to Alabama is substantial, so imported infections risk is significant. The strategy adopts a strict-first approach, with the lowest fraction in week 1 to aggressively limit incoming flow and reduce immediate imported infections, then gradually relaxing controls through weeks 3 and 4.

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy for Alabama's inbound traffic control prioritizes minimizing imported infections and deaths by adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions from each origin state. States with high infection prevalence and/or very large inflow volumes, such as Mississippi and Tennessee, receive strict-first patterns with lower traffic fractions in early weeks to sharply reduce early importation risk. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflow volumes, such as Iowa, Minnesota, and Nebraska, have even or relaxed-first patterns to maintain economic activity while managing risk. This cross-state balancing ensures Alabama reduces cumulative infections and deaths by limiting early exposure to high-risk inflows, while gradually relaxing controls to restore mobility and economic function. The quantitative logic uses the approximation that imported infected individuals per week are proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing ft in early weeks for higher-risk states substantially lowers imported infections during critical periods. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter and more front-loaded controls become more beneficial; conversely, if prevalence decreases, controls could be more relaxed evenly. The policy thus dynamically balances epidemic control and mobility based on each state's risk profile and inflow magnitude, with all fractions summing precisely to 1 to preserve total inbound flow over the 4-week horizon."

  "global_guidance": "The traffic control policies for Alabama prioritize minimizing imported infections and deaths by balancing epidemic control with necessary mobility. Across all origin states, a strict-first pattern with heavier traffic restrictions in the initial one or two weeks is consistently applied. This frontloads epidemic control by sharply reducing early imported infections, which are roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population). Early control is crucial to prevent exponential growth of cases within Alabama. States with higher infection prevalence and larger inflows (e.g., Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas) have stronger initial restrictions to mitigate their higher importation risk, while states with lower infection counts and smaller inflows have more moderate restrictions, preserving mobility. The total inbound flow over four weeks remains constant by ensuring the four weekly fractions sum to exactly 1 for each state, maintaining fairness and consistency. This approach leverages temporal risk balancing: stricter control early reduces the seeding of new cases, allowing later weeks to relax restrictions as local control improves. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, further frontloading restrictions would be beneficial, while lower prevalence would allow more relaxed patterns. The cooperative distribution of restrictions across states prevents overburdening any single origin, spreading epidemic risk mitigation equitably. This strategic temporal and spatial allocation of mobility controls optimizes epidemic outcomes in Alabama while respecting economic and social needs."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic policies from all origin states are designed to minimize imported infections and deaths in Alabama by managing weekly inflow proportions while keeping total 4-week inflow constant. States with higher infected populations and/or larger inflow volumes are assigned stricter controls in early weeks (strict-first pattern) to suppress initial importation risk, capitalizing on the critical early phase of epidemic control in Alabama. This reduces the likelihood of imported cases triggering local outbreaks and overwhelming healthcare capacities. Conversely, states with moderate or lower infection prevalence and inflow adopt even patterns, balancing steady epidemic suppression with economic and social mobility. The quantitative rationale relies on the approximate formula: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / TotalPopulation), showing that reducing ft in weeks of higher infection risk lowers imported infections. The approach achieves risk balancing across weeks and states, ensuring no week sees excessive inflow from high-risk origins, distributing risk temporally and spatially. This coordinated strategy mitigates epidemic spread while preserving essential mobility. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early-week controls may become more critical, and if these reduce, gradual relaxation might be expedited. Continuous monitoring of infection dynamics and mobility baselines is recommended to dynamically adjust fractions.

States with higher infected populations and/or larger inflow volumes are assigned stricter controls in early weeks (strict-first pattern) to suppress initial importation risk, capitalizing on the critical early phase of epidemic control in Alabama. This reduces the likelihood of imported cases triggering local outbreaks and overwhelming healthcare capacities. Conversely, states with moderate or lower infection prevalence and inflow adopt even patterns, balancing steady epidemic suppression with economic and social mobility. The quantitative rationale relies on the approximate formula: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / TotalPopulation), showing that reducing ft in weeks of higher infection risk lowers imported infections. The approach achieves risk balancing across weeks and states, ensuring no week sees excessive inflow from high-risk origins, distributing risk temporally and spatially. This coordinated strategy mitigates epidemic spread while preserving essential mobility. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early-week controls may become more critical, and if these reduce, gradual relaxation might be expedited. Continuous monitoring of infection dynamics and mobility baselines is recommended to dynamically adjust fractions. Overall, this policy framework prioritizes minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Alabama through targeted, temporally staged inbound traffic controls across all origin states.'

  "global_guidance": "The overall inbound traffic control policy for Alabama is designed to minimize imported infections and deaths by adjusting weekly traffic fractions from origin states based on infection prevalence, population size, and inbound flow. States with higher infection prevalence or large inflows (e.g., Tennessee, Mississippi, Texas) adopt a strict-first pattern with lower traffic fractions early on to reduce immediate epidemic pressure, gradually relaxing controls as conditions improve. States with lower prevalence or smaller inflows use even or slightly adjusted patterns to balance mobility and control. This cooperative approach distributes risk over time and space, preventing sudden surges of imported cases and allowing healthcare systems to better manage. The quantitative logic behind allocations uses the estimated imported infected cases proportional to traffic fraction and infection prevalence, emphasizing early reductions in high-risk origins. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) increases, stricter early controls may be required, while lower values allow more relaxed policies. This policy respects the total 28-day inbound traffic volume constraint by redistributing weekly fractions without changing totals, ensuring economic and social continuity. The balance of epidemic control and mobility is carefully managed to reduce cumulative cases and deaths in Alabama, thus protecting public health and sustaining essential travel."

The expected imported infections roughly scale with Flow * ft * (I / Population). Given moderate infection pressure, a strict-first pattern is chosen to reduce the imported infections early on, allowing gradual relaxation as the weeks advance. Early strict restrictions limit immediate epidemic seeding in Alabama, while later weeks can be more relaxed to balance mobility needs. The fractions sum to 1 exactly (0.35 + 0.30 + 0.20 + 0.15 = 1.0). The trade-off here prioritizes epidemic control early on, given Arizona's moderate infection prevalence, while maintaining some mobility to support economic ties."

The imported infected number is approximated by Flow * ft * (I / Population), which is significant here. Therefore, a strict-first control pattern is selected, allocating heavier restrictions on inbound flow in the first weeks to reduce seeding risk in Alabama. The decreasing fractions reflect a gradual relaxation as transmission risk is lowered or managed.

A relaxed-first pattern is chosen to allow some mobility early to support economic activity but increasing restrictions mid-period to curb infection import as transmission risk remains high.

  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic control policy for Alabama's inbound flows is designed to minimize cumulative infections and deaths by balancing early stringent controls with gradual relaxation. States with high infection prevalence (high I and E relative to population) and large inbound flows, such as Tennessee, Michigan, Arkansas, and Mississippi, are subject to a strict-first pattern with heavier restrictions in the first weeks to reduce immediate importation risk. This early control reduces seeding potential in Alabama when its susceptible population is large and risk of outbreak growth is highest. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller inbound flow, such as Idaho, Utah, Iowa, Nebraska, and Wisconsin, adopt a relaxed-first or balanced pattern to maintain essential mobility while delaying or mitigating importation risk. The weekly fractions for each state sum exactly to 1, ensuring that total inbound flow volume over four weeks remains constant but is temporally redistributed to optimize epidemic control. This cooperation logic balances epidemic pressures across states and weeks, reducing concurrent importation peaks and allowing Alabama's public health response to manage cases effectively. Sensitivity to parameters such as infection prevalence (I), exposed (E), and transmission rate (beta) is critical; increases in these parameters would justify stricter early controls, while decreases could allow more relaxed policies. Additionally, mobility baselines and economic considerations inform the gradual relaxation schedules, maintaining essential connectivity while prioritizing health outcomes. This coordinated, data-driven approach leverages population compositions and mobility patterns to strategically time traffic restrictions, minimizing disease introduction and mortality in Alabama."

Importing infections is roughly proportional to Flow * ft * (I / population), so maintaining even distribution (equal fractions) balances consistent traffic flow without sudden spikes in infection import. Arizona's moderate prevalence suggests neither strict front-loading nor relaxed early weeks is optimal; even allocation minimizes risk accumulation and allows steady monitoring. Trade-offs include maintaining mobility for economic reasons yet preventing potential outbreaks due to imported cases. The fractions sum exactly to 1, validating the allocation."

  "global_guidance": "The overall traffic control policy for Alabama focuses on reducing cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths by strategically allocating inbound traffic fractions over the next 4 weeks from all origin states. States with higher infection pressure, indicated by higher infected (I) and exposed (E) counts relative to their susceptible populations (S), receive stricter inbound traffic controls early (strict-first pattern). This reduces the number of infectious individuals entering Alabama during weeks when the epidemic risk is highest, minimizing initial seeding events. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or more stable epidemiological status adopt even traffic fractions to maintain economic mobility without significant infection risk. The total flow from each state remains constant, but shifting fractions toward later weeks for high-risk states leverages temporal dynamics to reduce early imported infections and consequent secondary transmission. This cooperative approach balances the epidemic risk across multiple states and weeks, avoiding overwhelming Alabama's healthcare system with imported cases. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls would be more beneficial to prevent exponential growth. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta declines, more even or relaxed-first patterns could be adopted to ease mobility. The traffic fractions for all states sum to 1, maintaining total inbound flow integrity. Overall, this policy minimizes cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Alabama by controlling imported infections from high-risk origin states early, while preserving necessary mobility for economic activity."

    "notes": "Arizona has a moderately sized infected population (I=630) relative to its total population (~12.49M). The risk of importing infections is proportional to inbound flow multiplied by the infected fraction (I/population). Since the infected fraction is moderate and steady, we apply an even distribution pattern to balance mobility and epidemic control. This approach maintains consistent traffic levels each week, preventing sudden surges that could overwhelm Alabama's healthcare system. We ensure the sum of fractions equals 1 (0.25+0.25+0.25+0.25=1). The trade-off is a moderate control level sustained over the month, which helps reduce cumulative cases without major economic disruption."

The expected imported infections scale as Flow*ft*(I/population). To minimize risk, we apply a strict-first pattern by reducing flow in the initial weeks (high control) and relaxing it later. This front-loading control helps limit immediate importation of infections, which is critical given Arkansas's higher infected ratio. The fractions sum to 1 (0.3+0.3+0.2+0.2=1). The trade-off involves initial mobility reduction to protect Alabama but allows gradual return to normalcy as the situation improves."

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic control policy for Alabama balances epidemic risk and mobility by tailoring weekly flow fractions per origin state based on their infection prevalence and inbound flow magnitude. States with higher infected populations or extremely high inbound flows (e.g., Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee) receive stricter traffic reductions in early weeks to limit the initial import of infections, thereby protecting Alabama from early surges. This strict-first control pattern frontloads epidemic control effort when imported infections could most exacerbate local outbreaks. Conversely, states with lower infected prevalence or moderate flows (e.g., Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota) adopt even traffic patterns to maintain steady mobility with minimal epidemic risk. Relaxed-first patterns are selectively applied for states with high infected prevalence but lower inbound flow to gradually reopen while controlling risk. Quantitatively, expected imported infections approximate Flow*ft*(I/population), guiding traffic fraction allocation to minimize cumulative infections and deaths. The sum of fractions per state is precisely 1 to conserve total inbound flow. Sensitivity analyses indicate that increased infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) would necessitate stricter early controls to maintain epidemic suppression, while lower prevalence permits more balanced mobility. Cross-state coordination ensures that overall importation risk is minimized by distributing traffic controls across states and weeks, preventing simultaneous surges that could overwhelm Alabama's health system. This dynamic and differentiated approach optimizes epidemic control while preserving critical mobility and economic functions."
