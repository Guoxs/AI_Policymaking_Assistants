  "global_guidance": "The overall traffic control recommendations across all origin states aim to minimize the total imported infections and deaths into Texas by strategically adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions while keeping total flow constant over 4 weeks. States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to their susceptible populations, such as Arkansas, Idaho, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Tennessee, are assigned stricter control in early weeks (lower fractions) to reduce immediate importation risk. This strict-first pattern helps flatten the curve of imported cases and prevents overwhelming local epidemic control capacity. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or moderate risk, like Alabama, Iowa, Minnesota, and Nebraska, have even or mildly relaxed-first distributions, allowing more consistent or gradually increasing flow to balance mobility needs. The strict-to-relaxed approach reflects the assumption that epidemic conditions and control measures improve over time, enabling safer relaxation later. Quantitatively, expected imported infections approximate Flow * ft * (I / population), so reducing ft in weeks with higher infection prevalence reduces immediate importation risk. By distributing flow fractions to sum exactly to 1 for each state, the total inbound volume remains constant, preserving economic and social mobility benefits while optimizing epidemic control. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early reductions would be more effective, while lower prevalence could allow more even distributions. This coordinated policy balances cross-state risk by temporally reallocating flow, reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Texas."

States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to their susceptible populations, such as Arkansas, Idaho, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Tennessee, are assigned stricter control in early weeks (lower fractions) to reduce immediate importation risk. This strict-first pattern helps flatten the curve of imported cases and prevents overwhelming local epidemic control capacity. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or moderate risk, like Alabama, Iowa, Minnesota, and Nebraska, have even or mildly relaxed-first distributions, allowing more consistent or gradually increasing flow to balance mobility needs. The strict-to-relaxed approach reflects the assumption that epidemic conditions and control measures improve over time, enabling safer relaxation later.

  "global_guidance": "Our recommendations collectively aim to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Texas by carefully modulating inbound traffic based on origin state infection pressures and population sizes. States with higher relative infected and exposed counts (e.g., Arkansas, Idaho, Michigan, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah) receive stricter traffic control initially to reduce early importation of infections, employing a strict-first pattern. This helps blunt the epidemic curve in Texas by limiting influx when risk is highest. Conversely, states with relatively lower infection pressure (e.g., Alabama, Indiana, Kentucky, Virginia, Wisconsin) follow even traffic allocations to maintain steady mobility without risking surges. Some states with moderate but rising risk (e.g., Arizona, New Mexico) receive relaxed-first patterns to balance economic activity early while tightening later to counteract potential increases. The quantitative cooperation logic balances the total flow, maintaining each state's total inbound volume but redistributing weekly fractions to mitigate peaks in imported infections, leveraging the formula imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population). This approach reduces the aggregate imported infected cases into Texas during critical weeks, lowering overall transmission. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early controls should be emphasized to prevent overwhelming local health systems. If prevalence decreases or effective vaccination increases, more even or relaxed-first patterns could be employed to support economic recovery. Our strategy also considers trade-offs between public health and economic impacts by smoothing restrictions over weeks and states rather than abrupt or uniform cuts, thus optimizing epidemic control while preserving essential mobility."

    "notes": "Alabama shows a moderate exposed (E=1468) and infected (I=457) population relative to its total population (~4.86 million susceptible). The risk of importing infected individuals into Texas is proportional to the inbound flow multiplied by the fraction and the ratio I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D). Given Alabama's moderate infection levels, a strict-first pattern is chosen to reduce immediate risk by enforcing stricter traffic control in the initial weeks (lower f1 and f2) while gradually relaxing in later weeks as Texas's own epidemic state stabilizes.

    "notes": "Arizona has a relatively higher exposed (E=2884) and infected (I=880) population with a large susceptible base (~7.2 million). The imported infection risk is significant given the higher infection prevalence and substantial inbound flow (~47,154 daily). Applying the imported infected formula, the risk is highest early on. Therefore, a strict-first pattern is adopted, with lower fractions in weeks 1 and 2 to mitigate immediate risk, then progressively relaxing control (fractions increasing) in weeks 3 and 4 as the epidemic curve improves. This approach balances the need to reduce imported infections early while allowing some mobility later. The fractions exactly sum to 1.0000, confirming consistency."

An even distribution pattern is selected here, maintaining consistent traffic control over the four weeks to avoid sudden spikes in imported cases.

  "global_guidance": "The overall traffic control policy across all origin states aims to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Texas by strategically timing inbound flow restrictions. States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to their susceptibles and significant daily inbound flows to Texas are assigned stricter controls in the first weeks (strict-first pattern) to reduce early importation of infections, which is critical to prevent seeding new outbreaks. Lower infection prevalence states or those with less risky profiles use even or relaxed-first patterns, balancing epidemic control with economic mobility. Quantitatively, expected imported infections depend on the product of inbound flow, the weekly fraction ft, and the infection prevalence ratio (I/population). By adjusting ft to be lower in weeks where infection prevalence or transmission risk is higher, we reduce immediate imported infection pressure. The cooperation across states leverages staggered control intensitiessome states hold strict controls early, while others relaxthus smoothing overall mobility impact while containing imported infection risk effectively. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become more critical to prevent case spikes, while lower values allow more even or relaxed distributions. This approach balances epidemic containment with socio-economic needs, ensuring that total inbound flow over 4 weeks remains constant per state but is temporally optimized to protect Texas's public health."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policy for Texas carefully balances epidemic control and mobility by adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions from each origin state while keeping total inflow constant. States with higher infected and exposed proportions relative to their population and significant daily inflow to Texas receive stricter early-week controls (lower fractions) to minimize imported infections when epidemic pressure is likely higher. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or more stable infection trends have even or relaxed-first patterns allowing more mobility early with gradual tightening. This cross-state cooperative approach reduces cumulative expected imported infections by distributing traffic control efforts temporally and spatially, avoiding simultaneous high inflow from multiple high-risk states that could amplify transmission. Quantitatively, imported infected cases scale with Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)), so lowering ft in weeks with higher infection pressure reduces risk. Sensitivity analysis shows that if prevalence increases or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early and mid-week controls would be needed, potentially shifting patterns toward stricter-first allocations. Conversely, if prevalence drops or vaccination improves immunity, more relaxed patterns could be adopted to restore mobility. This policy framework is adaptive and prioritizes minimizing confirmed and deceased cases in Texas by targeting temporal peaks in origin states' epidemic curves, validated by the exact sum-to-one fractions ensuring consistent total inflow."

The exposed population (E=1,898) is also non-negligible, indicating ongoing transmission risk. The formula for expected imported infections can be approximated as imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / (S+E+I+Q+R+D)), where Flow is the average inbound flow and ft is the fraction allocated for week t. Since Alabama's infection prevalence is steady but not rapidly increasing or decreasing, an even distribution pattern is chosen to balance mobility and control. This approach avoids sudden spikes or dips in traffic that could strain resources or allow uncontrolled spread. The trade-off here is maintaining stable flow to support mobility while keeping consistent control week-to-week. The fractions sum to exactly 1 (0.25+0.25+0.25+0.25=1), validating the allocation."

The infection prevalence is relatively high, suggesting an increased risk of imported cases. Using the imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population) logic, it is prudent to apply stricter controls earlier (lower ft values in weeks 1 and 2) and relax them later as infection pressure potentially decreases or to allow some economic activity. This 'strict-first' pattern helps reduce early seeding of infections into Texas while balancing the socio-economic impact over the 4 weeks.

The expected imported_infected scales with Flow*ft*(I/population). Following a 'strict-first' pattern with lower fractions in the initial weeks helps mitigate early infection importation, especially given the high initial infections.

  "global_guidance": "The overall inbound traffic control policy for Texas is designed to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically allocating traffic control efforts over the next 4 weeks across all origin states. States with higher infection prevalence, such as Michigan, Arkansas, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Tennessee, receive stricter controls in the initial weeks ('strict-first' pattern) to reduce the early seeding of infections into Texas. This helps lower the initial imported infection load, which is critical in controlling local transmission and preventing healthcare system overload. Conversely, states with lower or stable infection levels, like Alabama, Iowa, Nebraska, and Utah, have more even distributions to maintain consistent mobility while controlling risk. The allocation fractions for each state sum exactly to 1, ensuring the total inbound flow remains constant over 4 weeks. Quantitatively, the imported infection risk is approximately proportional to the product of daily inbound flow, the weekly fraction, and the ratio of infected individuals to the total population in the origin state. By applying stricter controls early in high-prevalence states, Texas can reduce the cumulative imported infections, which have a nonlinear impact on local outbreaks due to the infectious nature of the disease. This cooperative logic balances risk across states and weeks, ensuring no sudden surges in infection importation occur. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) were higher, stricter or prolonged controls would be required, while lower prevalence allows more relaxed policies. This flexible and data-driven approach minimizes epidemic impact while considering mobility and economic factors."

    "notes": "Alabama shows moderately low infection prevalence relative to its population (742 infected out of ~4.8M susceptible), indicating moderate risk of imported infections into Texas. The expected imported infections can be estimated as Flow*ft*(I/Population), where Flow is the inbound flow, ft is the weekly fraction, and I/Population reflects infectious prevalence. Given a stable infection level without notable recent growth, an even allocation pattern is chosen to maintain a consistent but moderate control over all four weeks, balancing epidemic control with mobility needs. This approach avoids sudden surges or overly restrictive weeks that could disrupt travel while maintaining steady low risk. The fractions sum to exactly 1 (0.25+0.25+0.25+0.25)."

States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to susceptible populations receive stricter controls early (strict-first) or gradually relaxed controls (relaxed-first) to prevent initial surges in imported cases and enable monitored mobility resumption. States with moderate or low infection pressure employ even distribution to balance control and mobility consistently. This cross-state coordination helps distribute imported infection risk over time, preventing spikes that could overwhelm Texas's healthcare system. Quantitatively, imported infections scale approximately with Flow*ft*(I/Population) for each state-week; thus, lowering ft in weeks when Texas is vulnerable reduces importation. The cooperation logic ensures that states with higher risks have lower ft early on, while states with lower risks maintain stable traffic, collectively minimizing cumulative cases. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early restrictions should be intensified, especially for high-risk states, to maintain control. Conversely, if beta decreases or Texas's local epidemic improves, relaxing traffic earlier may be possible. The chosen fractions always sum to exactly 1 per state, preserving total inbound traffic volume but redistributing weekly loads to optimize epidemic control and mobility trade-offs."

With a large average inflow of about 30,533 daily to Texas, the imported infected cases can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/Population). To minimize imported infections, stricter controls earlier (low fractions in week 1 and 2) can help reduce initial disease seeding in Texas. The infection pressure shows no sharp increase, so a strict-first approach is chosen to suppress early transmission risk, then progressively relaxing control as the local epidemic potentially stabilizes. Trade-offs involve reducing mobility early, which impacts economic and social aspects, but reduces Texas's cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000, validating the allocation."

Given the moderate infection prevalence and relatively stable recent epidemic data, an even traffic allocation is chosen. This evenly spreads the importation risk over time, avoiding sharp spikes in imported cases. The imported infected are proportional to Flow*ft*(I/Population), so equal fractions maintain consistent control without abrupt mobility shocks. This pattern balances epidemic control with maintaining steady mobility. The fractions sum to 1.000 exactly."

This represents a substantial importation risk. A strict-first pattern is used to impose the strongest control in the initial weeks (0.35 and 0.30 fractions), then gradually relax as the epidemic risk potentially diminishes. This strategy aims to reduce early imported infections that could seed Texas outbreaks. The trade-off is reduced mobility early, but it is justified given Arkansas's higher infection prevalence.

Due to high infection prevalence, a pattern with stricter early weeks (week 1 fraction 0.20) but moderate relaxation later is selected to reduce initial imported infections.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations for Texas from its origin states collectively aim to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically adjusting weekly traffic fractions. States with higher infection prevalence and/or larger inbound flows, such as Arkansas, Oklahoma, Tennessee, New Mexico, and Alabama, receive strict-first traffic control patterns, concentrating lower fractions in the initial weeks to suppress early seeding of infections in Texas. Conversely, states with moderate or lower infection prevalence and stable epidemiological trends are allocated even fractions to balance epidemic control with consistent mobility, preventing sudden economic disruptions. The strict-first approach leverages the understanding that imported infections are roughly proportional to the product of traffic flow, the fraction allocated that week, and the infected proportion in the origin state population. By reducing early traffic from higher-risk origins, Texas limits the number of imported infected individuals when the local epidemic is most vulnerable to new seeding. Later weeks see gradual relaxation to allow mobility recovery. The allocations sum exactly to one per state, ensuring no net change in total inbound volume over the 4 weeks, only temporal redistribution. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase in any origin state, stricter front-loading controls become more critical to prevent importation-driven outbreaks in Texas. Conversely, lower prevalence or beta allows more balanced or relaxed patterns. Overall, this coordinated cross-state traffic control strategy balances epidemic suppression with economic and social mobility to effectively reduce Texas's epidemic burden."

The expected imported infected individuals can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/population). Given the relatively stable infection numbers, a 'strict-first' pattern is recommended to reduce inbound flow early when the risk is highest. This means stronger controls in weeks 1 and 2 (0.35 and 0.30 fractions), gradually relaxing in weeks 3 and 4. The trade-off balances epidemic control by limiting early seeding of infection in Texas with maintaining some mobility later. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000."

The imported infection risk is proportional to the infectious proportion times flow and fraction. To minimize Texas' cases, a 'strict-first' pattern is chosen, reducing flow in early weeks to curb new introductions. The flow fractions gradually increase towards week 4, allowing some mobility.

Imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/population). Given this high risk, a 'strict-first' approach is warranted to strongly limit inbound flow early, thus mitigating the seeding of Texas infections.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies collectively aim to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Texas by strategically allocating inbound traffic flows from origin states over the next 4 weeks. The approach is to reduce early-week traffic (strict-first pattern) from states with higher infection pressure (high I and E relative to S) and/or high inflow volumes, thus limiting early seeding of infections into Texas. States with lower infection pressure or smaller inflow volumes are allowed relatively relaxed early flows but tighten mid-period to balance risk and economic activity. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections from each state in week t approximate to Flow*ft*(I/population), so concentrating stricter controls in weeks with higher infection prevalence effectively reduces overall imported infections. By balancing strict-first and relaxed-first patterns across states, the policy achieves a temporal and spatial risk distribution that avoids overwhelming healthcare capacity in Texas. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more critical to prevent exponential growth in Texas. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, a more even or relaxed-first pattern could be considered. This cooperative cross-state strategy leverages the temporal dynamics of infection to optimize mobility restrictions, achieving epidemic control with minimized socioeconomic disruption. The fractions for all states strictly sum to 1.000, ensuring total inbound flow volumes remain consistent with ground truth while effectively redistributing weekly inflow."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies collectively aim to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Texas by adjusting the weekly inbound traffic fractions from each origin state while keeping total flow constant over the next 4 weeks. States with higher infected populations relative to their susceptible populations and large daily inflows to Texas, such as Oklahoma, Arkansas, New Mexico, and Mississippi, receive stricter control (lower fractions) in the first week to reduce immediate importation of active infections. This strict-first pattern is crucial to quickly reduce the infection pressure entering Texas, thereby lowering the risk of local transmission and severe outcomes. In contrast, states with lower infection prevalence or stable infection trends are assigned more even or mildly strict-first patterns, balancing epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs. The quantitative logic follows the formula: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population), emphasizing that reducing ft in weeks with higher infection risk effectively lowers imported infections. Week-by-week allocation balances the trade-off between controlling infection spread and maintaining necessary mobility to support economic activities. The fractions for each state sum exactly to 1, preserving total inbound flow as per constraints. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence rises or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls would be even more critical to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence declines, traffic can be relaxed earlier to boost mobility. Coordination across states ensures that reducing flow from high-risk states in early weeks is complemented by gradual relaxation in lower-risk states or later weeks, optimizing overall epidemic control while minimizing disruption. This cooperative approach reduces cumulative cases and deaths in Texas by strategically managing imported infection risk over time."

  "global_guidance": "The overall traffic control strategy across all origin states focuses on minimizing early importation of infections into Texas, where the local infection prevalence is moderate. By allocating stricter controls in the initial one or two weeks (strict-first pattern) for most states with higher infection and exposed prevalence, the policy reduces immediate introduction of infected and exposed travelers, which can seed local transmission chains. States with steady or lower infection prevalence and moderate flows receive even traffic allocation to balance epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs. The total inbound flow from each origin state over four weeks remains constant, ensuring no reduction in total mobility but redistributing it over time to reduce peak importation pressure. This approach leverages quantitative cooperation logic: since imported infections scale roughly with Flow*ft*(I/population), lowering ft in initial weeks decreases early imported cases. Relaxing controls in later weeks supports mobility and economic recovery without significantly increasing cumulative infections, assuming local Texas epidemic control measures are stable. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence rises or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls are even more critical to prevent importation. Conversely, if prevalence or beta decrease, a more even allocation could suffice. The balance between epidemic control and mobility is maintained by adjusting weekly fractions to sum exactly to 1, preserving total inbound flow while shaping temporal risk. This coordinated temporal and cross-state allocation minimizes cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Texas effectively."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic control policy for Texas optimizes the timing and volume of inbound flows from each origin state to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. The key principle is to flatten the imported infection curve by applying stricter control (lower fractions) in early weeks when infection pressure is high or rising in the origin state and/or Texas, while relaxing controls in later weeks assuming epidemic risk declines or Texas strengthens internal control. This approach reduces peak imported infections and prevents overwhelming Texas health system. Quantitatively, imported infections scale with inbound flow, infection prevalence in the origin state (I/population), and fraction ft. By adjusting ft weekly while keeping total flow constant, the policy leverages temporal risk balancing across states and weeks, targeting high-risk periods for stricter control. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence in origin states rises or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early-week controls become more critical to prevent surges. Conversely, if prevalence falls or beta decreases, more relaxed early controls can be considered. This dynamic, data-driven approach ensures that Texas manages epidemic risk effectively while preserving economic and social mobility. The sum of fractions for each origin state is precisely 1.000, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant as required."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic control policies prioritize early reduction of inbound flow from states with higher infection prevalence relative to population, following a strict-first pattern to minimize immediate imported infections and deaths in Texas. States with lower or moderate infection levels or greater uncertainty adopt even or relaxed-first patterns to balance epidemic control with economic and logistical mobility needs. Quantitatively, imported infections are roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), so front-loading stricter controls where infection pressure is higher reduces cumulative transmission risk. Weekly flow fractions sum to 1 for each state to maintain total inbound flow over 28 days, ensuring mobility needs are met while allowing temporal control. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence rises or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become more critical to prevent exponential growth. Conversely, if prevalence declines or beta decreases, more uniform or relaxed patterns may suffice. The coordination across states ensures that no week is overwhelmed by imported cases, spreading risk evenly or front-loading controls as appropriate. This combined approach aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Texas while respecting mobility demands and state-specific epidemic contexts."

The imported infected can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/population), where population here is the sum S+E+I+Q+R+D. With steady infection pressure, a relaxed-first pattern with gradually easing traffic restrictions is selected to balance mobility and control. Starting stricter in week 1 (20%) reduces initial importation risk, allowing Texas to adapt, then relaxing in weeks 3 and 4 to support mobility. This staged approach helps minimize imported cases while maintaining traffic volume constant. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.20+0.25+0.30+0.25=1.00), validating the allocation."

  "global_guidance": "The overall inbound traffic control strategy for Texas balances epidemic control and mobility by adjusting the weekly flow fractions per origin state to minimize imported infections and deaths. States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to their susceptible base, such as Utah, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Michigan, receive stricter initial traffic control with lower week 1 fractions and gradually relaxed controls in later weeks. This relaxed-first pattern allows Texas to reduce early importation risk when epidemic pressure is highest and then gradually restore mobility to support economic activity. States with lower infection prevalence, such as Iowa and Virginia, are assigned more even or mildly relaxed-first patterns, maintaining stable traffic while monitoring risk. The quantitative logic of imported infected cases ~ Flow*ft*(I/population) guides these allocations, ensuring that the total inbound flow per state remains constant but shifted to later weeks where the infection prevalence may decrease or the healthcare system can better manage cases. This inter-week balancing reduces the overall risk of outbreak propagation in Texas. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls would be more beneficial to reduce initial imported cases, whereas if beta decreases or prevalence reduces, the traffic fractions can be more evenly distributed to favor mobility. Cross-state coordination in traffic control ensures that high-risk states reduce early flow more significantly, preventing simultaneous peaks of imported infections and allowing Texas to allocate resources effectively. Thus, the recommended traffic fractions are designed to sum exactly to 1 per origin state, preserving total flow while modulating risk temporally and spatially to minimize epidemic impact."

  "global_guidance": "The traffic control policy across all origin states aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Texas by strategically allocating inbound traffic fractions over the next 4 weeks. The primary principle is to adopt a strict-first pattern for states with high infection prevalence (I and E) and/or high inbound flow to Texas, frontloading restrictions to reduce imported infections when risk is highest. This lowers initial seeding events and gives Texas time to manage local transmission better. For states with moderate or lower prevalence and flow, more balanced or even patterns with slightly stricter controls early on are used to maintain epidemic control while mitigating economic impacts. Quantitatively, the expected imported infected is approximated as Flow*ft*(I/Population), so reducing ft in early weeks for high-risk states reduces imported cases significantly. The cooperative logic balances weeks and states by concentrating restrictions early in high-risk states, allowing gradual relaxation later, while states with lower risk maintain more even flows to preserve mobility. This approach collectively flattens the imported infection curve, reducing pressure on Texas' healthcare system and minimizing deaths. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls would be even more critical. Conversely, if beta decreases or prevalence drops, controls can relax sooner. The policys fractional allocations always sum exactly to 1 per state, ensuring total inbound flows remain consistent with ground truth, preserving fairness and predictability. Overall, this coordinated, risk-based traffic control strategy optimally mitigates imported infection risks and balances economic considerations."

    "notes": "Alabama's epidemic data shows a relatively low infected (I=1117) and exposed (E=3613) population compared to its susceptible population (S=4762746), indicating moderate infection pressure. The imported infected can be approximated by Flow * ft * (I / population), where population is the sum of compartments. Given the sizable inflow (38249 daily average) and moderate infection prevalence, a strict-first pattern is recommended to reduce early imported infections and prevent seeding new outbreaks in Texas. Early weeks (f1=0.15, f2=0.25) have stricter control to minimize initial risk, with relaxation in later weeks (f3=0.3, f4=0.3) balancing mobility and economic activity. This approach mitigates early importation while allowing some flow later when local Texas control may be stronger. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000, ensuring consistent total inbound flow."

The daily inflow is substantial (53497.93), so imported infections are a concern. Using the formula imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), early reductions in flow can significantly reduce early imported cases. A strict-first pattern with increasing fractions over time (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) is chosen to limit initial seeding into Texas during higher risk weeks, gradually relaxing controls as the situation potentially improves or as Texas' local controls strengthen. This balances epidemic control with mobility needs, especially given Arizona's economic ties. The fractions sum to 1.000."

Its large average daily inflow (104440.71) to Texas amplifies risk of imported infections. The imported infected can be estimated as Flow*ft*(I/population). A strict-first pattern is applied with lower fractions initially (0.12, 0.22) and higher in later weeks (0.33, 0.33) to reduce initial seeding and allow mobility later. This strategy aims to reduce cumulative cases and deaths in Texas by mitigating early importation when Texas epidemic is more vulnerable. The fractions sum precisely to 1.000."

However, Idaho's daily inflow into Texas is low (5497.36), so the total imported risk is less impactful. Given this, a balanced even pattern (0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25) is chosen to maintain consistent mobility without large disruptions, acknowledging the limited impact on Texas epidemic but preventing potential spikes.

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Texas due to imported infections, a coordinated traffic control policy is implemented across all origin states. The key principle is to reduce inbound flow fractions during early weeks (strict-first pattern) for states with higher infection prevalence (I and E values relative to S) and/or higher inbound flows, since early importation seeds outbreaks that grow exponentially. Lowering early week fractions reduces the expected imported infected cases, as approximated by imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/population), thereby lowering epidemic pressure in Texas. Later weeks see relaxed restrictions to balance mobility and economic activity. States with lower infection prevalence and smaller flows adopt more even or mildly strict patterns to avoid unnecessary disruption yet maintain some control. This cross-state balance ensures the total inbound flow remains constant (sum of fractions is exactly 1 for each state) while reshaping temporal distribution to reduce peak importation risks. Sensitivity to infection beta, local prevalence, and temporal trends guided fraction allocations. For example, if prevalence or beta were higher, stricter early controls would be more critical; if Texas local control improves, relaxation could be accelerated. This cooperative strategy balances epidemic control with socio-economic needs, prioritizing early risk reduction to minimize cumulative disease burden in Texas."

The imported infected cases roughly scale as Flow*ft*(I/population). Given the steady infection levels and large inbound flow, a strict-first pattern is chosen to reduce early-week inflow and thus lower early imported infections. This pattern delays some mobility but balances economic needs by relaxing controls in later weeks. The fractions sum to 1.0 exactly, confirming allocation validity."

  "global_guidance": "Across all origin states, the recommended inbound flow allocation follows primarily a strict-first pattern, where inbound flows are reduced in the initial weeks and gradually relaxed in later weeks. This approach leverages the epidemiological principle that early reduction of imported infections significantly lowers cumulative cases and deaths in Texas. Since imported infections scale approximately as Flow*ft*(I/population), reducing ft in weeks with higher infection prevalence or early in the timeline reduces seeding events that could trigger larger outbreaks. The strict-first pattern also balances economic and mobility needs by allowing partial relaxation in later weeks. States with lower infection prevalence or stable epidemiological dynamics are assigned near-even distributions to maintain mobility with moderate control. This cooperative strategy across states distributes risk reduction temporally, avoiding simultaneous high inflow from multiple high-risk states in early weeks. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence increases or transmission rate beta rises, the strict-first approach gains even greater importance to control imports early. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed patterns could be considered to enhance mobility. Overall, by coordinating inbound flows across states and weeks, the policy aims to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Texas while maintaining necessary mobility and economic activity."
