The expected imported infections are approximated by Flow * ft * (I / population), suggesting that controlling flow early (weeks 1 and 2) reduces initial risk. Adopting a strict-first pattern with lower traffic in early weeks and relaxed later is chosen to immediately curb importation and allow gradual reopening as risk presumably decreases. This balances epidemic control by reducing early imported infections and mobility by allowing relaxed travel later.

States with higher infection prevalence and/or very large inbound flows (e.g., Iowa, Arkansas, South Carolina) are subject to stricter control in the initial weeks to reduce early seeding risk, following a strict-first or relaxed-first pattern with increasing fractions over time. Conversely, states with moderate or lower infection levels and steadier risk profiles adopt even traffic distributions to maintain predictable and manageable importation rates. The quantitative cooperation logic involves distributing the risk of imported infections over the 4 weeks by modulating weekly fractions so that the overall imported infected cases remain constant but temporally shifted to reduce epidemic peaks. This approach leverages the fact that early restrictions can reduce secondary transmission chains and deaths more effectively than uniform policies. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if the infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) increases, stricter early controls would be more beneficial, whereas lower values would allow more relaxed policies. Similarly, if mobility baselines rise, the early strict control weeks become critical to prevent exponential growth. Overall, these coordinated allocations across states and weeks optimize the trade-off between epidemic control and mobility, aiming to minimize health impacts while sustaining essential travel."

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic allocations across origin states aim to minimize the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Nebraska by strategically distributing traffic controls over four weeks. States with higher infection prevalence (I) and high inflow volumes receive stricter controls early (strict-first pattern) to reduce the early importation of infectious individuals, which is critical to prevent initial seeding and exponential outbreak growth. For states with moderate or low infection rates but substantial inflows, even or relaxed-first patterns are applied to balance economic activity with epidemic control, allowing some mobility while preparing for potential risk increases. The quantitative logic underpinning these decisions relies on the estimation that imported infections approximately scale with the product of inflow volume, control fraction, and the infectious prevalence (I/population) in the origin state. By front-loading control measures in higher-risk states and smoothing control in lower-risk states, the model reduces the peak imported infection pressure on Nebraska's health infrastructure. The allocations are constrained to sum to one per state to maintain the total expected inbound flows unchanged, ensuring policy feasibility. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter and earlier controls would become more critical. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta diminishes, controls can be relaxed more rapidly. The coordinated approach balances epidemic suppression with economic and social needs, reducing the probability of imported cases sparking local outbreaks while preserving essential mobility across states."

This pattern lowers the early importation of infectious individuals, which is critical to prevent seeding and exponential growth in Nebraska's susceptible population. For states with very high inbound flows but relatively lower infection prevalence like Iowa, a relaxed-first pattern is used to allow essential mobility initially but tightens control later to mitigate delayed risk. The total inbound flow from each origin state remains constant over the 4 weeks by adjusting weekly fractions that sum exactly to 1.0, ensuring no reduction in total mobility but temporal redistribution to optimize epidemic control. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections scale approximately as Flow*ft*(I/S), so lowering fractions in weeks with higher infectious pressure reduces imported risk. Coordinated across states, this approach balances the risk of imported cases and economic mobility. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls would further reduce imported infections and deaths. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, traffic controls can be relaxed earlier. This adaptive and cooperative strategy provides a robust framework to minimize epidemic impact while preserving essential mobility."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound flow allocations collectively aim to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Nebraska by balancing infection risk and mobility across origin states and weeks. States with higher infection prevalence relative to their populations and higher daily inflows, such as Arkansas, Idaho, Utah, and Texas, receive stricter traffic controls earlier (strict-first patterns) to reduce early imported infections when epidemic pressure is highest. This reduces the seeding of new chains of infection in Nebraska. Conversely, states with moderate or low infection prevalence and/or smaller inflows adopt even or relaxed-first patterns, allowing more mobility early to support economic activity while maintaining control. The mathematical logic approximates expected imported infections as the product of daily inflow, control fraction per week, and the ratio of infected individuals to the total population in the origin state. By ensuring the sum of weekly fractions equals exactly 1 for each state, the total inbound flow remains constant, maintaining fairness and predictability in traffic regulations. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls in high-prevalence states become even more critical to prevent spikes in imported cases. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccination coverage improves, traffic controls can be relaxed earlier to support mobility. This cooperative allocation across states and weeks balances epidemic control and economic considerations, mitigating risk of outbreaks in Nebraska while minimizing unnecessary mobility restrictions."

Conversely, states with lower or stable infection pressure adopt even traffic allocations to balance epidemic control and economic mobility. The underlying quantitative logic relies on the proportionality of imported infections to Flow multiplied by fraction and infected prevalence (Flow*ft*(I/population)). By distributing traffic unevenly across weeks for riskier states, the policy reduces peak importation pressures, allowing local containment to improve before relaxing controls. This cooperative approach across states balances trade-offs between mobility and epidemic control, preventing overwhelming imported case surges. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter frontloading of controls or extending stringent weeks would be warranted. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccination increases, allocations can be relaxed more evenly.

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic control recommendations collectively prioritize reducing early-week traffic fractions from states with higher infection prevalence to minimize initial imported infections, which is critical to preventing early outbreaks in Nebraska. States with higher exposed and infected counts relative to population receive stricter early-week reductions (strict-first pattern), as early suppression of importations is more effective at lowering cumulative cases and deaths. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or very high baseline flows sometimes use more balanced or relaxed-first patterns to maintain essential economic activity while managing risk. The total inbound flow from each state remains constant over the 4 weeks to respect mobility baselines and economic needs, but weekly fractions are adjusted to time-shift traffic to lower-risk periods. This temporal balancing exploits the effect of disease dynamics and incubation periods to reduce peak importation risk. Quantitatively, imported infections scale approximately with Flow * fraction * (I/population), so front-loading restrictions when I is high reduces cumulative cases significantly. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early-week controls become more critical, while if they decrease, more even distributions could suffice. Coordinated control across states thus balances imported infection risk and mobility needs, minimizing epidemic impact on Nebraska."

The key principle is to reduce the early week traffic fraction (strict-first pattern) from states with higher infection prevalence (high I and E values) and/or high inbound flows, thereby minimizing the initial importation of infected individuals which is proportional to the product of inbound flow, weekly fraction, and infected prevalence (Flow*ft*(I/population)). This approach helps prevent early seeding and amplification of the disease within Nebraska. For states with lower infection prevalence or lower flows, an even distribution pattern is sometimes chosen to maintain steady mobility and control, avoiding abrupt changes that may disrupt socio-economic activities. A notable exception is Iowa, which has a very high inbound flow but relatively lower infected prevalence; there, a relaxed-first pattern is used to allow more traffic initially when risk is lower, tightening later to mitigate delayed transmission risks. Cross-state risk balancing is achieved by allocating stricter controls to states contributing higher importation risk and relaxing those with lower risk, optimizing the overall inflow risk profile across weeks. Sensitivity considerations recognize that changes in prevalence or transmission rate (beta) would necessitate recalibration of these fractionshigher beta or prevalence would require more aggressive early restrictions to curtail importation. Conversely, improvements in local Nebraska epidemic parameters might allow more relaxed controls. The fractions for each origin state sum exactly to 1 to preserve total inbound flow, ensuring that the temporal redistribution of traffic does not reduce overall mobility but strategically modulates it over weeks to minimize epidemic impact."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations across origin states prioritize reducing cumulative imported infections into Nebraska by adjusting weekly traffic fractions while keeping total 4-week inflow constant. States with higher infection prevalence relative to their susceptible populations and significant inflows, such as Idaho, Utah, and Arkansas, adopt a strict-first pattern with heavier early restrictions to blunt initial infection importations. Conversely, states with moderate or lower infection prevalence and inflows, such as Alabama, Indiana, Minnesota, and Virginia, use an even pattern to balance mobility and epidemic control. For some states with moderate-high infections but moderate inflow, like Arizona, Michigan, Ohio, and Texas, a relaxed-first pattern with mid-period tightening is chosen to allow some mobility early with subsequent stricter control to reduce cumulative case importations. This cross-state coordination leverages temporal reallocation of traffic to flatten import infection pressure peaks, minimizing the risk of overwhelming local control measures in Nebraska. The imported infected cases scale approximately with Flow * ft * (I/S), so shifting inflow away from weeks with higher infection prevalence or transmission risk reduces cumulative infections and deaths. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early restrictions become more critical, and if they decrease, more relaxed patterns may suffice. Overall, this strategy balances epidemic control with mobility needs, ensuring the total inbound flow remains constant but optimally distributed over time to minimize Nebraska's epidemic burden."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies collectively aim to minimize imported infections and deaths in Nebraska through a coordinated strict-first pattern for most origin states with moderate to high infection prevalence. This front-loads stricter traffic controls in the initial weeks, reducing early imported infectious individuals, which is critical for limiting epidemic growth in Nebraska's susceptible population. States with lower infected proportions, such as Iowa, receive even traffic allocations to maintain mobility without significant risk increase. The quantitative cooperation logic balances each state's infection prevalence and flow volume to allocate stricter controls proportionally, thus optimizing overall infection importation reduction while preserving essential mobility. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early restrictions become more beneficial, while lower prevalence may allow more relaxed patterns.

This front-loads stricter traffic controls in the initial weeks, reducing early imported infectious individuals, which is critical for limiting epidemic growth in Nebraska's susceptible population. States with lower infected proportions, such as Iowa, receive even traffic allocations to maintain mobility without significant risk increase. The quantitative cooperation logic balances each state's infection prevalence and flow volume to allocate stricter controls proportionally, thus optimizing overall infection importation reduction while preserving essential mobility. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early restrictions become more beneficial, while lower prevalence may allow more relaxed patterns. This coordinated approach mitigates cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by controlling imported infections effectively across all weeks and origins, ensuring Nebraska's epidemic burden is minimized."

By frontloading stricter restrictions in the first and second weeks, the policy minimizes initial imported infections and subsequently the confirmed and deceased cases in Nebraska. This approach leverages the incubation and infectious periods modeled by the SEIQRD parameters, where early imported infections have cascading effects on local transmission. Balancing epidemic control with mobility, the gradual relaxation in weeks three and four supports economic and social activities while maintaining lower importation risk as prevalence ideally declines or stabilizes. The allocation fractions sum exactly to one for each state, ensuring the total inbound flow remains constant, meeting ground truth constraints. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence increases or the transmission rate (beta) rises, stricter early restrictions become even more critical to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence or beta decreases, the policy can safely relax controls earlier. Coordination among states is essential: states with higher infected-to-susceptible ratios and large flows to Nebraska are assigned stronger early restrictions to balance overall importation risk. This cooperation reduces the cumulative burden on Nebraska's healthcare resources and limits epidemic growth. The chosen strict-first pattern reflects a conservative, risk-averse approach aligned with the SEIQRD dynamics and mobility data, optimizing for minimal cumulative confirmed and deceased cases."

The imported infected cases roughly scale as Inflow * ft * (I/Population), so reducing flow in the first weeks helps reduce early seeding. Given the steady but not sharply increasing infection prevalence, a strict-first pattern (higher control initially) is chosen to minimize early imported infections and reduce potential outbreaks. Gradually relaxing control balances mobility needs. The fractions sum to exactly 1, ensuring consistent total flow."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies collectively aim to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Nebraska by strategically allocating inbound traffic fractions over the next four weeks based on origin states' infection prevalence and inflow volumes. States with higher infected counts and exposure, such as Arkansas, Michigan, Ohio, and Oklahoma, adopt a strict-first pattern, imposing stronger initial traffic restrictions to reduce early seeding events in Nebraska when local prevalence is still manageable. This front-loaded control helps suppress outbreak initiation and growth. Conversely, states with moderate or lower infection prevalence or very high flow volumes, such as Iowa and Texas, utilize relaxed-first or even patterns to balance epidemic control and economic mobility, acknowledging that abrupt or sustained severe restrictions could have disproportionate socio-economic impacts. The fractional allocations always sum to exactly one, maintaining the total inbound flow constant per state, as required. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early control patterns should be intensified or prolonged to prevent importation-driven outbreaks. Conversely, decreasing prevalence allows more balanced or relaxed control. The cooperation between states via these staggered and tailored controls smooths the total infection import risk over time, preventing sudden spikes that could overwhelm Nebraska's healthcare resources. This approach balances epidemic risk reduction and mobility maintenance, optimizing public health outcomes and socio-economic considerations."

The infected proportion is low, but due to the high inbound flow, imported infected cases are notable. Imported infected can be approximated by Inflow x fraction x (I / population). To minimize infection import, stricter controls are needed earlier when the infectious pressure is higher. We thus choose a strict-first pattern, with heavier restrictions in week 1 and gradually relaxing. This pattern reduces initial imported infections, slowing spread in Nebraska. The trade-off is reduced mobility early on, but this is justified by the risk reduction. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.40+0.30+0.20+0.10=1)."

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic control strategy for Nebraska is designed with a strict-first pattern for all origin states, prioritizing early reduction of imported infections to suppress initial seeding and subsequent epidemic growth. This pattern is justified by the SEIQRD epidemiological parameters and observed prevalence in origin states. By imposing stricter controls in the initial weeks (lower fractions), especially when infection prevalence (I and E) is high relative to the susceptible population, the cumulative imported infected cases are minimized. Imported infected cases are roughly proportional to the product of inbound flow, fraction of flow allowed, and the infection prevalence (I+E)/population in the origin state. Lowering the early fractions directly reduces the seeding pressure during critical periods. The trade-off involves temporary mobility restrictions that may impact economic and social activity, but this is balanced by longer-term epidemic control and reduced healthcare burden in Nebraska. The strategy gradually relaxes controls in later weeks, enabling mobility recovery and economic activity resumption once the initial risk period passes. Across states, this uniform pattern prevents simultaneous high importation spikes from multiple origins, distributing risk over time and enabling Nebraska's health system to manage cases better. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases in origin states, stricter early controls become even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or effective vaccination reduces susceptibility, early restrictions could be relaxed somewhat. The model assumes steady prevalence over weeks; significant fluctuations would warrant adaptive controls. Overall, balancing epidemic control and mobility through temporal traffic control allocation optimizes Nebraska's risk mitigation against economic disruption. This coordinated approach is robust to moderate parameter changes and supports sustained epidemic suppression."

The overall infection pressure from Alabama is moderate. Imported infections can be approximated by Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing flow in earlier weeks when prevalence is higher helps minimize importation. Given the steady but moderate infection burden, a strict-first pattern is chosen to front-load restrictions in weeks 1 and 2 (35% and 30% of flow respectively), relaxing gradually in weeks 3 and 4. This balances epidemic control by suppressing early importation and mobility needs by allowing more flow later. The fractions sum to exactly 1.0000, ensuring the total flow remains constant."

  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic control strategy for Nebraska's inbound flows prioritizes minimizing early importation of infections from origin states with significant infected (I) and exposed (E) populations. By applying a strict-first patternreducing flow fractions in weeks 1 and 2 across most stateswe target the period when local susceptibility is high and imported infections can lead to exponential local transmission. The fractions for each state are calibrated to sum exactly to 1, preserving total inflow but redistributing it temporally to delay and reduce importation impact. States with higher infection prevalence and inflow, such as Arizona, Utah, and Indiana, receive more stringent early restrictions to reduce their infection pressure on Nebraska. Conversely, states with lower infection risk but high inflow, like Iowa, have a somewhat relaxed-first pattern, spreading flow more evenly to balance control and mobility needs. This cross-state coordination ensures that Nebraska's epidemic curve is minimally impacted by inbound infections, reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. Quantitatively, imported infections relate to Flow*ft*(I/population), so front-loading restrictions where I/population is high is effective. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infectious prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more balanced or relaxed patterns could be considered to support mobility.

By applying a strict-first patternreducing flow fractions in weeks 1 and 2 across most stateswe target the period when local susceptibility is high and imported infections can lead to exponential local transmission. The fractions for each state are calibrated to sum exactly to 1, preserving total inflow but redistributing it temporally to delay and reduce importation impact. States with higher infection prevalence and inflow, such as Arizona, Utah, and Indiana, receive more stringent early restrictions to reduce their infection pressure on Nebraska. Conversely, states with lower infection risk but high inflow, like Iowa, have a somewhat relaxed-first pattern, spreading flow more evenly to balance control and mobility needs. This cross-state coordination ensures that Nebraska's epidemic curve is minimally impacted by inbound infections, reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. Quantitatively, imported infections relate to Flow*ft*(I/population), so front-loading restrictions where I/population is high is effective. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infectious prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more balanced or relaxed patterns could be considered to support mobility. Overall, the strategy balances epidemic control with economic and social mobility by temporally redistributing traffic without reducing total inbound flow, helping to manage epidemic risk optimally."

The risk of importing infections into Nebraska is proportional to the product of the inbound flow and the infected fraction, roughly Flow*ft*(I/S). Given the daily average inflow of 917.43, we allocate stricter control in the later weeks (week 4 fraction = 0.20) to gradually reduce risk as local Nebraska cases potentially rise. The first week allows a relaxed control (0.30) to balance mobility needs early on. This 'strict-last' pattern helps mitigate later-stage import risks while maintaining economic activity.

With a large daily inflow of 5,837.61, the imported infected estimate Flow*ft*(I/S) suggests significant infection pressure. We choose a 'relaxed-middle' pattern to allow some mobility early (week 1 fraction = 0.20), increase in week 3 (0.30) to accommodate economic demands, but tighten slightly in week 4 (0.25) to prevent late spikes.

We adopt a 'relaxed-late' pattern with low initial fractions (week 1=0.15) to strongly control early importation and increase flow later (week 3=0.35, week 4=0.30) to balance mobility demands.

  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic allocation strategy prioritizes reducing the cumulative imported infections and subsequent confirmed and deceased cases in Nebraska by dynamically adjusting weekly inbound flows from each origin state while keeping total inbound volume constant. States with higher infection prevalence or exposed populations and/or large inflowssuch as Iowa, Arizona, Idaho, Texas, and Utahare assigned traffic patterns emphasizing stricter control in later weeks ('strict-last' or 'relaxed-middle') to prevent late-stage infection import spikes that could exacerbate local outbreaks. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure or smaller inflows like Mississippi, New Mexico, Virginia, and Wisconsin have even traffic distributions, balancing mobility and control. This cooperative approach leverages temporal risk balancing, distributing stricter controls to weeks of higher infection pressure and relaxing controls when risk is lower, thus smoothing the epidemic curve and lowering the reproduction potential from imported cases. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence rates or transmission coefficients (beta) increase, a shift towards stricter early control is warranted to contain seeding; if prevalence decreases, more relaxed policies can be adopted without risking resurgence. The cumulative fractions per state strictly sum to 1, ensuring consistency with the ground truth total inbound flow, and the fractional values remain within [0,1], guaranteeing valid traffic control implementations. Overall, this policy optimally balances epidemic mitigation with maintaining essential mobility and economic activity."

    "notes": "Alabama shows a relatively low number of infected individuals (I=1117) compared to its large susceptible population. The imported infected cases can be roughly estimated as Flow*ft*(I/Population). Since Alabama's infection rate is moderate and its daily inflow is low (921), an even pattern of traffic allocation is chosen to maintain balanced mobility without risking sudden spikes in imported infections. This pattern also helps distribute any risk evenly over time, minimizing potential outbreak bursts. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.25*4=1), ensuring no change in total flow volume over 4 weeks."

The inbound flow is significant (6972 daily), so stricter control is necessary earlier to limit imported infections. Imported infected roughly scale as Flow*ft*(I/Population). Therefore, a strict-first pattern with lower fractions in weeks 1 and 2 reduces early importation risk, while relaxing control later reflects expected improvements or balancing economic needs.

The imported infections roughly scale with the formula: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / state_population), so reducing ft (fraction) in weeks with higher infection prevalence effectively lowers the influx of infected individuals. For states with lower infection pressure or smaller inflow, even or relaxed-first patterns are adopted to maintain economic mobility without significantly increasing epidemic risk. The fractions for each state sum to exactly 1, ensuring total flow volume remains constant over the 4 weeks, maintaining fairness and feasibility. The cross-state approach balances risks temporally and spatially by distributing stricter controls where and when infection pressures are highest, while allowing relaxation in safer contexts to preserve mobility. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter controls earlier would be even more critical to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, lower prevalence may allow more relaxed patterns. The approach is adaptive and can be updated with real-time data to optimize outcomes continually. Overall, this coordinated, data-driven traffic control policy supports Nebraska's epidemic control goals while minimizing unnecessary mobility restrictions."

    "notes": "Alabama's infection prevalence is moderate with I=385 and E=1306 over a population of approximately 4.88 million susceptible individuals. Imported infections can be approximated by Flow*ft*(I/population), indicating a proportional relationship between inbound flow fraction and imported infection risk. Given a decreasing recent trend in Alabama's active infections, a strict-first pattern is chosen, applying stricter controls early (weeks 1 and 2) to reduce immediate importation of cases into Nebraska. This balances epidemic control with maintaining some mobility later for economic and social reasons. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.30+0.25+0.25+0.20=1), validating allocation."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations across all origin states collectively aim to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Nebraska by strategically adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions while keeping the total 4-week flow constant. The core approach uses the principle that imported infections are proportional to the product of inbound flow fraction, infectious prevalence (I/population), and baseline flow volume. States with higher infection prevalence or exposed populations are assigned stricter controls early (strict-first pattern), reducing immediate importation risk when the epidemic burden is high, and then gradually relaxing controls in later weeks to balance mobility and economic activity. Conversely, states with lower or stable infection trends and large susceptible populations adopt a relaxed-first pattern to maintain some mobility initially but tighten controls later if needed. This week-by-week reallocation balances the risks by flattening the importation curve, reducing peak pressure on Nebraska's healthcare system. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase unexpectedly, stricter early controls become more critical, enhancing the value of strict-first patterns. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta reduces, more relaxed patterns could be safely adopted. Coordinated cross-state management ensures no single state overwhelms Nebraska's epidemic control efforts, distributing restrictions temporally and geographically. This nuanced balance of epidemic control and mobility sustains essential travel while minimizing infection importation and subsequent deaths. All fraction vectors per state sum exactly to 1, ensuring consistency with total inbound flow constraints."
