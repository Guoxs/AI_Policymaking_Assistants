  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy distributes inbound traffic from origin states into Virginia over the next four weeks with a mix of even, strict-first, and relaxed-first patterns tailored to each state's infection dynamics. States with high early infection and exposure levels (e.g., South Carolina, Tennessee, Idaho) receive strict traffic control at week 1 to prevent seeding new infections in Virginia, gradually relaxing controls to support mobility recovery. States with moderate or stable infection rates are allocated even fractions to balance epidemic control and economic activity. The total inbound flow from each origin remains constant, preserving mobility volume but shifting timing to minimize importation risk during peak infectious periods. This cooperative approach leverages temporal balancing; by limiting inflow during weeks with higher infection prevalence in the origin, cumulative imported infections and deaths in Virginia are reduced. Sensitivity to changes in prevalence or transmission rates (beta) suggests that stricter early control yields the greatest marginal benefit, as early imported infections exponentially amplify local outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence declines, the model adapts naturally via relaxed patterns to optimize mobility. Coordination across states also prevents simultaneous relaxation that could spike imported infections.

States with high early infection and exposure levels (e.g., South Carolina, Tennessee, Idaho) receive strict traffic control at week 1 to prevent seeding new infections in Virginia, gradually relaxing controls to support mobility recovery. States with moderate or stable infection rates are allocated even fractions to balance epidemic control and economic activity. The total inbound flow from each origin remains constant, preserving mobility volume but shifting timing to minimize importation risk during peak infectious periods. This cooperative approach leverages temporal balancing; by limiting inflow during weeks with higher infection prevalence in the origin, cumulative imported infections and deaths in Virginia are reduced. Sensitivity to changes in prevalence or transmission rates (beta) suggests that stricter early control yields the greatest marginal benefit, as early imported infections exponentially amplify local outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence declines, the model adapts naturally via relaxed patterns to optimize mobility. Coordination across states also prevents simultaneous relaxation that could spike imported infections. Overall, the policy attempts to flatten importation-driven infection curves while preserving essential inter-state mobility."

For states with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflows, even or relaxed-first patterns are chosen to balance economic and social mobility with epidemic control. Allocations ensure the total inbound flow over 4 weeks remains constant per origin state, satisfying constraints. The quantitative logic uses the approximate proportionality of imported infections to Flow*ft*(I/S) for each origin state, guiding tighter restrictions when infection prevalence and inflow risks are higher. Cross-state coordination reduces overall imported infections to Virginia across weeks by distributing restrictions to early periods, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter and earlier restrictions become more critical, while lower prevalence could allow more even or relaxed patterns. This adaptive approach balances epidemic risk mitigation with economic and social mobility needs, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia."

The imported infected can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)) which suggests that stricter control (lower ft) early can reduce initial imported infections. Alabama's infection pressure is stable but non-negligible. Hence, a strict-first pattern is chosen: applying stronger restrictions in weeks 1 and 2 to curb early inflow, with gradual relaxation weeks 3 and 4 to balance mobility. This pattern minimizes seeding risk in Virginia while respecting total flow. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

The imported infected cases roughly follow imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)), indicating risk scales with flow and infection prevalence. Given the fairly steady infection pressure, a strict-first pattern is chosen to reduce early week inflow when infections contribute most to spread in Virginia's early epidemic stage.

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy balances strict early traffic controls for states with high infection prevalence and inflow to Virginia, such as Ohio, Michigan, Tennessee, and Indiana, with more even or slightly relaxed patterns for states with lower infection pressure or lower inflow. This coordinated approach minimizes cumulative imported infections by front-loading restrictions when Virginia's epidemic is most vulnerable to seeding events, thus reducing early transmission chains and downstream deaths. Quantitatively, imported infections are proportional to inbound flow multiplied by the infected proportion in each origin state and allocation fraction per week. By allocating lower fractions (stricter controls) in initial weeks from high-risk states, we reduce initial imported infections and their exponential propagation. States with lower infection prevalence and inflow maintain even allocations to preserve economic activity with manageable risk. This cooperation across states leverages temporal risk balancing, shifting mobility towards later weeks as epidemic risk declines. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls would be more critical to contain imported infections. Conversely, if prevalence falls, controls can be relaxed progressively. The allocations ensure total inbound flow remains constant, preserving baseline mobility while optimizing epidemic outcomes. This coordinated and data-driven allocation minimizes expected confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia over the next month."

The infected proportion I/S is low but non-negligible, indicating a moderate risk of importing infections into Virginia. The expected imported infections each week can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population), here Flow is ~8806 daily average. Given the relatively stable infection prevalence, an even distribution of traffic control fractions (0.25 each week) is chosen to maintain balanced mobility and epidemic control. This even strategy avoids sudden pressure on any single week, mitigating potential spikes in imported cases. Trade-offs include slight relaxation in all weeks balanced by consistent control, preventing lapses in vigilance. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.25 * 4 = 1), ensuring the total inbound flow remains constant."

Infection prevalence is moderate but with some risk due to high E and I values. The total inbound flow is ~5584 daily. The pattern chosen is relaxed in the middle weeks (weeks 2 and 3) and stricter in weeks 1 and 4, reflecting a 'relaxed-first' approach in the middle weeks to test and monitor infection trends, while early and late weeks have stricter controls to limit initial import and later resurgence. Imported infections are proportional to Flow * ft * (I / population), so reducing ft in weeks 1 and 4 reduces risk during critical times. This balances mobility needs and epidemic control.

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia, the inbound traffic allocation across origin states strategically balances epidemic risk and mobility needs over the next 4 weeks. States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to susceptible individuals, such as Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Utah, and Indiana, receive traffic allocations favoring stricter controls early (low fractions in week 1) and moderate relaxation later, thereby reducing initial imported infections when seeding risk is highest. Conversely, states with lower or moderate infection prevalence employ even or relaxed-first patterns to sustain economic and social mobility without compromising control. The quantitative logic relies on the proportionality of imported infections to the product of inbound flow, fraction allocation, and infection prevalence (I/population). By adjusting weekly fractions to reduce traffic during periods of higher risk and allowing relaxation when risk lowers or monitoring data permits, the policy minimizes overall infection pressure. Cross-state cooperation is crucial: the sum of fractions per state equals exactly 1, preserving total inbound flow, while weekly fraction patterns stagger traffic restrictions to avoid simultaneous high-risk import surges. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more beneficial, while lower prevalence permits more mobility. The approach is robust, balancing epidemic suppression with mobility demands, maintaining consistent total flow, and adapting weekly allocations based on risk assessment across states."

    "notes": "Alabama has a significant susceptible population of 4,790,585 with moderate exposed (2,843) and infected (882) individuals. The infected fraction relative to population is about 0.018%. The inbound flow is substantial (8598.6 daily). The imported infections can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / total population), with total population roughly the sum of S, E, I, Q, R, D (~4,819,800). Given moderate infection pressure and high flow, a balanced even distribution (even pattern) of traffic control fractions is chosen to avoid spikes in any week. This reduces risks by spreading imported cases evenly rather than concentrating in any single week. Trade-offs include maintaining mobility while controlling infection importation risks. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.25+0.25+0.25+0.25=1), validating the allocation."

With a daily flow of 6,666.8, imported infections are approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population). Given a slight decreasing or stable infection trend, a relaxed-first pattern with higher fractions in weeks 1 and 2 (0.3 each) followed by stricter control in weeks 3 and 4 (0.2 each) is selected to front-load mobility while reducing risk later.

Because infection pressure is high and likely increasing, a strict-first pattern is chosen with lower fractions initially (0.15, 0.2) and gradually relaxing control later (0.3, 0.35).

States with higher infection prevalence and exposed/infected counts relative to their populations (e.g., Arkansas, Idaho, Ohio, Texas, Utah) receive stricter early-week controls (lower fractions initially) to reduce early importation risk when infections are high. This strict-first pattern delays risky travel, allowing epidemic conditions to improve before relaxing controls. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or stable conditions (e.g., Alabama, Iowa, Oklahoma) have even distributions to maintain steady mobility and balanced risk. Some states with moderate prevalence but high flows (e.g., South Carolina, Arizona) use relaxed-first patterns to support early economic activity while tightening controls later as a precaution. This cross-state balancing leverages temporal distribution of traffic to flatten the importation risk curve over the month. The sum of fractions per state is exactly 1, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if prevalence rises or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls would be more beneficial, while if prevalence decreases, more relaxed or even patterns could be used.

Given the large daily inflow (11165.6), the imported infected estimate roughly equals Flow*ft*(I/S), implying higher inbound traffic risks during weeks with relaxed controls. We adopt a strict-first pattern to reduce immediate imported infections, allocating only 20% in week 1 and progressively relaxing to 30% in week 3 when local Virginia infections are expected to be better managed. The trade-off balances initial epidemic control with gradual mobility normalization. The fractions sum to exactly 1.0, ensuring total flow consistency."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic control policies for Virginia's origin states strategically prioritize early stringent restrictions for states with high infection prevalence (I and E) and significant inbound flow to minimize imported infections and resultant deaths. This strict-first pattern delays and flattens infection peaks by reducing early-week inbound traffic from high-risk states, allowing Virginia's local control measures (reflected in SEIRD parameters) to be more effective. States with lower infection pressure or smaller inflows adopt even allocations to maintain steady mobility while controlling risks. The cumulative inbound flow over 4 weeks remains constant per origin to meet mobility demands, but temporal redistribution mitigates epidemic impact. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become more beneficial, emphasizing the importance of early interventions. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed early policies could be considered to further facilitate mobility. The cross-state balance ensures that no single state's flow dominates early importation risk, distributing control efforts effectively. Overall, this coordinated temporal traffic control aligns with Virginia's epidemic parameters (beta, alpha, gamma, mu, delta) to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases while preserving essential mobility and economic activity."

The cross-state balance ensures that no single state's flow dominates early importation risk, distributing control efforts effectively. Overall, this coordinated temporal traffic control aligns with Virginia's epidemic parameters (beta, alpha, gamma, mu, delta) to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases while preserving essential mobility and economic activity."

States with higher infected and exposed ratios relative to their susceptible populations (e.g., South Carolina, Idaho, New Mexico, Utah) are assigned relaxed-first patterns with stricter control in weeks 1 and 4 and relaxed flow in weeks 2 and 3. This approach reduces peak infection importation risks when epidemic pressures are likely higher, while permitting some economic and social activity during mid-period weeks. Conversely, states with low infection prevalence (e.g., Iowa, Nebraska, Alabama) are allocated even fractions to maintain steady flow without unnecessary restrictions. The relaxed-first pattern dominates because infection pressures often increase or are sustained mid-period, making early and late restrictions more effective at reducing importation risk. The approach also exploits the total inbound flow constancy by redistributing weekly fractions without reducing total volume, preserving economic activities but modulating temporal risk. Quantitatively, imported infections approximate Flow*ft*(I/S), so lowering ft during weeks with higher infection prevalence or epidemic risk reduces imported infections and downstream epidemic expansion in Virginia. Cross-state cooperation is reflected by varying patterns tailored to each state's epidemic status, collectively smoothing the inflow risk profile over time. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter controls or more pronounced relaxed-first patterns would be necessary to prevent spikes, while lower prevalence might justify more even distributions. This adaptive, data-driven approach optimally balances public health and mobility objectives."

The imported infected cases can be approximated by Flow * ft * (I / population), where Flow is the inbound flow and ft is the fraction for week t. Given the consistent infection levels, the traffic allocation pattern chosen is 'strict-first', imposing stricter controls initially (week 1 fraction 0.30) to reduce early imported infections and gradually relaxing controls as the weeks progress. This helps minimize early spread in Virginia, which currently has a moderate number of active infections (I=524). The trade-off is balancing economic mobility and epidemic control; strict early controls reduce risk but may impact mobility and connectivity. The fractions sum exactly to 1.00, validating the allocation."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia, the inbound traffic control policies prioritize stricter controls in the early weeks for states with higher infection prevalence (high I and E relative to population) and large inbound flows, such as South Carolina, Tennessee, Ohio, and Michigan. This 'strict-first' approach reduces early imported infections that could seed outbreaks in Virginia, which currently has moderate active infections. States with lower infection pressure or smaller flows, like Arkansas, Iowa, and Nebraska, follow an even allocation to maintain balanced mobility and epidemic control. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections from each origin state in week t is approximated by Flow * ft * (I/population), where ft is the weekly fraction. By front-loading stricter controls (lower ft) in high-risk states during initial weeks, the cumulative imported infections decrease, thus lowering secondary transmissions and deaths in Virginia. The cooperation across states and weeks balances epidemic risk and mobility needs, avoiding overwhelming restrictive measures but effectively controlling importation risk. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter controls in earlier weeks should be intensified further. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed policies may be feasible. Overall, these policies leverage temporal and spatial heterogeneity in infection pressure to allocate inbound flows optimally, minimizing Virginia's cumulative epidemic burden while preserving essential mobility."

Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed policies may be feasible. Overall, these policies leverage temporal and spatial heterogeneity in infection pressure to allocate inbound flows optimally, minimizing Virginia's cumulative epidemic burden while preserving essential mobility."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations across all origin states aim to collectively minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia by strategically timing mobility controls based on infection prevalence and flow volumes. States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to their susceptible base, especially those with high inbound flows (e.g., Ohio, Tennessee, South Carolina), have stricter traffic reductions front-loaded in week 1 to sharply reduce early imported infections that could seed local outbreaks. This strict-first pattern reduces the initial epidemic pressure in Virginia, decreasing the basic reproduction number and subsequent case burden. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure or smaller flows receive more balanced or relaxed-first patterns to maintain economic activity without significantly increasing risk. The flow fractions always sum to 1 per state, ensuring the total inbound flow remains constant over 4 weeks, thereby preserving mobility but redistributing it temporally for epidemic control. This temporal redistribution exploits the nonlinear epidemic dynamics where early reductions in imported infections have outsized impact on cumulative cases and deaths. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become more critical, while if these parameters decrease, more relaxed allocations may suffice. The coordination across states balances risk, preventing overwhelming importation in any single week while allowing phased economic activity, thus providing a robust and flexible strategy to mitigate Virginia's epidemic burden while respecting mobility needs."

    "notes": "Alabama presents a moderate infection prevalence with I=462 and E=1468 relative to its population of about 4.8 million, indicating some ongoing transmission risk. The inbound flow to Virginia is significant (13354 daily), implying a considerable number of potential imported infections. The expected imported infected count per week is roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population). Given the relatively stable infection levels over the past 28 days and no strong trend indicated, an even pattern of traffic allocation (equal fractions) is chosen to maintain consistent epidemic control without overly restricting mobility in any particular week. This balances the trade-off between controlling imported infections and allowing stable mobility. The fractions sum to exactly 1 (0.25+0.25+0.25+0.25=1)."

The inbound flow is lower (6575 daily), but infection prevalence is higher than some states. By allocating stricter control early (f1=0.2) and relaxing slightly in the middle weeks (f2=0.3, f3=0.3) followed by tightening again (f4=0.2), we can flatten any potential infection peaks and reduce cumulative imported infections. This 'strict-first' pattern aims to prevent early seeding of infections in Virginia, considering Arizona's moderate infection prevalence. Fractions sum to 1."

A relaxed-first pattern (lower fraction first week) is not advisable due to high infection burden. Instead, a strict-first approach with more control in early weeks (f1=0.15) and gradual relaxation (f2=0.3, f3=0.35) to allow some mobility after initial containment is optimal. This helps reduce cumulative imported infections while balancing economic and social needs. Fractions sum to 1."

A pattern with moderate early control (f1=0.3, f2=0.3) followed by relaxed later weeks (f3=0.2, f4=0.2) balances reducing early imported cases while allowing some mobility as the epidemic potentially stabilizes.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations for Virginia employ a strategic balance across origin states and weeks to minimize cumulative infections and deaths. Collectively, stricter controls are emphasized in the initial weeks for states with higher infectious and exposed populations and/or higher inbound flows, effectively reducing early seeding of infections in Virginia. This 'strict-first' pattern helps flatten the curve of imported infections and gives Virginia's healthcare system time to manage cases. For states with lower infection prevalence or smaller flows, even distribution of traffic allocation balances epidemic control with the need to maintain mobility and economic activities. Quantitatively, imported infected cases roughly scale as Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing ft in early weeks for high-risk states lowers imported infection pressure substantially. Cooperation across origin states is implicit, as traffic reductions in one high-risk state complement controlled inflows from others, reducing cumulative imported cases. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls should be further intensified to counteract higher import risks. Conversely, if these parameters decrease, traffic control can be relaxed sooner. Moreover, the chosen weekly fractions always sum to exactly 1, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant to meet ground truth constraints, while varying weekly proportions optimize epidemic outcomes. This multi-state coordinated approach balances epidemic control with social and economic mobility, adapting dynamically to infection risks and inbound flow magnitudes."

    "notes": "Alabama has a moderate infection level with I=423 and E=1350 relative to its population of about 4.8 million susceptible individuals. The imported infected cases roughly scale as Flow * ft * (I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)), so we expect the same total inflow but can adjust weekly proportions to mitigate spread. Alabama's infection levels are stable without strong increasing or decreasing trend indicated, so an even distribution (equal fractions of 0.25 each week) is reasonable. This balances mobility needs with epidemic control, avoiding harsh early restrictions that could impact economy or late relaxations that risk surges. The fractions exactly sum to 1.0, ensuring total flow stays constant."

  "global_guidance": "The overall traffic control strategy balances infection risk from each origin state by adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions while keeping total 4-week flow constant.

Conversely, states with moderate or stable infection levels use even or relaxed-first patterns to balance economic activity and epidemic control. This cross-state coordination ensures that cumulative imported infections into Virginia are minimized by front-loading restrictions on high-risk states and weeks, while maintaining mobility where risk is lower. Quantitatively, imported infected cases roughly scale with Flow * ft * (I / total population), so reducing ft in early weeks for high-risk states effectively lowers overall imported infection pressure. The approach is robust to moderate changes in prevalence or transmission rate beta; if prevalence increases, stricter early controls become more critical, while if beta decreases, more relaxed patterns could be feasible. Sensitivity analysis suggests that balancing control across states and weeks, rather than uniform restrictions, better optimizes the trade-off between epidemic control and mobility. This strategy thus aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia by targeting inbound flows dynamically based on state-specific infection pressures and temporal trends."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic policies across all origin states adopt primarily a strict-first pattern, with some states modeled on even traffic allocation when infection pressure is moderate and inflows are smaller. This strategy prioritizes imposing stricter travel controls in the initial weeks to curb imported infections, which is crucial for preventing seeding events that can amplify local outbreaks in Virginia. The strict-first pattern aligns with the need to reduce early epidemic pressure, especially from states with higher infected populations and large daily inflows. By gradually relaxing traffic restrictions in later weeks, this approach balances epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs, allowing gradual normalization as local and imported infection risks decline. The quantitative cooperation logic relies on the infection pressure formula: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / total_population), where ft is the weekly flow fraction. By adjusting ft to be lowest in early weeks for high-risk origin states, the overall expected imported infections are minimized. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence and inflow receive even allocation to maintain steady mobility without compromising control. While total inbound flow remains constant per state over 4 weeks, redistributing flows temporally reduces peak importation risks, smoothing epidemic curves and hospital burden in Virginia. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become even more critical, and relaxation should be delayed. Conversely, if prevalence declines or vaccination/immunity improves, earlier relaxation could be safe. Overall, this coordinated multistate, multiweek traffic control policy optimizes reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia by minimizing imported infections in the critical early weeks, while maintaining essential mobility and economic function."

Given the high daily average inflow (8598.6), the risk of imported infections is substantial. Since Alabama's infection level is moderately steady, a strict-first pattern is chosen to front-load controlling inbound traffic in the early weeks (f1=0.30, f2=0.25), tapering to more relaxed control later. This approach reduces early seeding of infections in Virginia where current I is low but vulnerable. The trade-off balances mobility needs and epidemic control by gradually relaxing controls.

Conversely, states with extremely high infection prevalence but lower inflow adopt a relaxed-first pattern to balance economic needs without large importation risk. Even patterns are applied to states with moderate infection prevalence and steady inflow to maintain stable control and mobility. The quantitative cooperation logic ensures the total inbound flow per origin state remains constant over four weeks, but weekly proportions are adjusted to concentrate control measures when infection risk is highest, thus lowering overall imported infections. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence rises or the transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter front-loading of control (higher f1, f2) becomes more critical to prevent epidemic surges in Virginia. Conversely, if prevalence or beta decreases, more relaxed and balanced patterns can be tolerated. This dynamic allocation across origin states and weeks effectively balances epidemic control goals with mobility and economic considerations, minimizing imported infections and subsequent local spread in Virginia."

The expected imported infections can be approximated by Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)) where Flow is the daily average inbound flow to Virginia. Alabama's infection prevalence is moderate, so an even pattern is chosen to balance epidemic control and mobility, spreading traffic evenly across the four weeks to avoid concentrated risk. This approach reduces the chance of a sudden spike in imported cases and allows consistent monitoring. The trade-off is maintaining steady economic activity while controlling disease spread.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations for Virginia from all origin states collectively aim to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically adjusting weekly traffic fractions while keeping total 4-week inflow constant per state. States with high infection prevalence (high I and E relative to susceptible population) such as Idaho, Michigan, Ohio, Utah, and Texas are controlled more strictly in the initial weeks to reduce early importation risk, employing a relaxed-first pattern with low fractions in week 1 and gradually increasing later. This reduces early seeding of infections in Virginia, where the local infected population is significant. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or moderate risk such as Alabama, Iowa, Nebraska, and Minnesota follow an even distribution, balancing mobility and epidemic control steadily over time. Some states with moderate risk warrant strict-first patterns, allowing more mobility early but tightening later to prevent late surges. The overall approach balances the trade-off between epidemic control and economic activity by smoothing traffic flows over time and applying stricter controls when infection pressure is highest. This multi-state coordinated strategy reduces peak importation risks and helps flatten the epidemic curve in Virginia. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls and more pronounced front-loading of restrictions would be necessary to maintain effectiveness. Conversely, if local control improves or prevalence decreases, traffic relaxations could be accelerated. The weekly fractions sum to exactly 1 for each origin state, ensuring the total planned inflow remains consistent with ground truth while optimizing temporal distribution to minimize disease spread. This coordinated temporal traffic control approach effectively balances public health priorities with mobility needs, maximizing epidemic mitigation without unnecessarily restricting travel."

The imported infections can be estimated as Flow*ft*(I/S), meaning the expected imported infections are proportional to the flow and the infection prevalence. Given Alabama's relatively stable and moderate infection prevalence, an even distribution (equal fractions) across the 4 weeks balances epidemic control and mobility needs without overly restricting traffic at any particular time. This approach avoids sudden surges or drops in traffic that could disrupt mobility or cause spikes in imported cases. The fractions sum to exactly 1, validating the allocation."

To reduce risk early on and allow some relaxation later, a strict-first pattern is chosen with lower fractions in the initial weeks (0.20,0.20) and higher fractions later (0.30,0.30).

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic control policy for Virginia carefully balances epidemic control and mobility across 19 origin states by allocating inbound flow fractions over the next 4 weeks such that total flow remains constant per state. States with higher infection and exposure prevalence relative to their susceptible population are assigned stricter traffic controls in the initial weeks (strict-first pattern), minimizing early imported infections that could accelerate Virginia's epidemic. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or moderate risk receive even or mildly relaxed-first allocations, supporting economic activity while maintaining control. The expected imported infections are approximately proportional to the product of inbound flow, fraction allocated to the week, and infection prevalence (I/S). By shifting more traffic to later weeks for high-risk states, we reduce initial importation pressure when Virginia's epidemic is vulnerable, allowing local interventions to strengthen. This cross-state cooperation leverages temporal distribution to balance risk, avoiding simultaneous surges in imported infections while preserving overall mobility. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) changes, adjustments in the strictness and timing of traffic controls would be necessary. Higher beta or prevalence would warrant more stringent early restrictions to mitigate spread, while lower values might permit more relaxed patterns. This dynamic allocation strategy thus provides a robust framework to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia by managing imported infection risks effectively over time and origin states."
