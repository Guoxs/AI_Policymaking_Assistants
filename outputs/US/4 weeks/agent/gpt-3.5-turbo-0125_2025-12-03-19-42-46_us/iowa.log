  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy balances epidemic control and mobility by adjusting weekly inbound traffic fractions for each origin state, ensuring total 4-week flow remains constant. States with high infection prevalence and exposed populations are assigned strict-first or relaxed-first patterns to minimize early importation risks, which is critical given Iowa's current low infected state. In contrast, states with low infection prevalence or very large susceptible populations but high flow are assigned even distributions to avoid sudden spikes in imported cases. This approach leverages temporal allocation of traffic to reduce peak imported infections, minimizing pressure on Iowa's health system. Quantitatively, imported infected cases are proportional to inbound flow times infection prevalence (I/population). By modulating weekly fractions, we spread imported risks over time or delay them to when local control is stronger. Cross-state cooperation logic ensures that when some states relax controls, others tighten, preventing synchronized surges. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become more critical to avoid outbreaks. Conversely, if beta reduces (through vaccination or mask use), flows can be relaxed earlier. This flexible temporal allocation supports epidemic control while accommodating economic and social mobility demands. All fractions sum to exactly 1 per origin state, preserving flow constancy and policy feasibility."

States with high infection prevalence and exposed populations are assigned strict-first or relaxed-first patterns to minimize early importation risks, which is critical given Iowa's current low infected state. In contrast, states with low infection prevalence or very large susceptible populations but high flow are assigned even distributions to avoid sudden spikes in imported cases. This approach leverages temporal allocation of traffic to reduce peak imported infections, minimizing pressure on Iowa's health system. Quantitatively, imported infected cases are proportional to inbound flow times infection prevalence (I/population). By modulating weekly fractions, we spread imported risks over time or delay them to when local control is stronger. Cross-state cooperation logic ensures that when some states relax controls, others tighten, preventing synchronized surges. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become more critical to avoid outbreaks. Conversely, if beta reduces (through vaccination or mask use), flows can be relaxed earlier. This flexible temporal allocation supports epidemic control while accommodating economic and social mobility demands. All fractions sum to exactly 1 per origin state, preserving flow constancy and policy feasibility."

Those with stable or lower infection levels use even or relaxed-first patterns to balance epidemic control with mobility needs.

By staggering restrictions across weeks and states, the approach avoids simultaneous peaks of imported infections that could overwhelm Iowa's healthcare system. This cooperation among states leverages temporal and spatial heterogeneity in infection prevalence to optimize disease control. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early restrictions become more critical to prevent super-spreading via mobility. Conversely, if prevalence declines, more relaxed or even patterns suffice to sustain economic activity safely.

The exposed (E=1468) and confirmed (Q=12,883) are also significant, indicating ongoing transmission. The imported infection risk can be approximated by Flow * ft * (I / population), where Flow is the daily inbound flow and ft is the weekly fraction of traffic allowed. Given the moderate infection pressure decreasing recently, a strict-first pattern is chosen to suppress early importation risks and prevent seeding new outbreaks in Iowa. This frontloading of restrictions balances epidemic control with mobility by easing controls gradually as risk lowers. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.35+0.30+0.20+0.15=1), ensuring total flow over 4 weeks equals the ground truth."

Using the imported infection risk formula, the risk is elevated but stable, so an even pattern is appropriate to maintain consistent control without drastic disruptions.

The confirmed (Q=4,889) and deaths (D=296) indicate moderate epidemic severity. The imported infection risk is significant due to high I and E values. A strict-first pattern is selected to reduce immediate importation risk, with gradual relaxation as the epidemic curve flattens. This trade-off prioritizes epidemic control early while allowing eventual mobility recovery. The fractions sum to exactly 1, ensuring consistent total flow."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocations prioritize reducing cumulative imported infections and deaths in Iowa by adjusting weekly traffic fractions based on origin states' infection pressures and epidemic trends. States with higher infected and exposed populations have stricter controls early (strict-first pattern) to minimize initial importation risk, which is critical to prevent seeding new outbreaks in Iowa. Those with stable or increasing infection trends are assigned relaxed-first or even patterns to balance economic impacts and epidemic control. The overall strategy leverages temporal risk balancing by concentrating stricter controls when infection pressure is highest and relaxing when risk subsides, thus minimizing cumulative exposure. Quantitatively, the imported infection risk is roughly proportional to the product of inbound flow, weekly fraction, and infected prevalence (Flow * ft * (I/population)). Ensuring the sum of fractions equals one for each origin state preserves total mobility baseline while redistributing it to optimize epidemic outcomes. This coordination across states and weeks is essential because uncontrolled importations from any high-risk origin can seed outbreaks. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls would be more beneficial, while reductions would allow more relaxed patterns. The policy balances epidemic mitigation and mobility preservation by adapting control intensity dynamically and heterogeneously across origin states based on their epidemic status, thus minimizing Iowa's cumulative confirmed and deceased cases over the next four weeks."

The infected proportion (I=367) relative to population (4,847,226) is low but not negligible. Expected imported infections can be approximated by Flow*ft*(I/population). Given the steady infection level and high inflow, we adopt a strict-first pattern, allocating lower fractions in the first two weeks (0.30 each) to reduce initial imported infections and higher fractions later as conditions stabilize. The trade-off balances epidemic control (reducing early importation) and maintaining mobility over time. The fractions sum precisely to 1."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the traffic control policy aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Iowa by allocating inbound traffic fractions that reflect the infection pressure and mobility volume from each origin state. States with higher infection prevalence and inflow, such as Arkansas, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, and Wisconsin, receive stricter early controls (strict-first pattern) to reduce initial imported infections when Iowa's susceptible population is high, thus reducing epidemic seeding and subsequent deaths. For states with large inflow but steady infection levels (Minnesota, Nebraska, Texas, Wisconsin), an even allocation pattern balances mobility and epidemic risk, preventing spikes that could overwhelm control capacity. For states with moderate infection and inflow but rising trends or uncertainties (Idaho, Utah), a relaxed-first pattern allows initial caution followed by increased mobility, leveraging the expected reduction in Iowa's internal infections over time. This cooperative allocation balances risk across weeks and states, ensuring total inbound flow per origin remains constant while redistributing risk temporally to curb early epidemic amplification. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early control fractions should be increased further to compensate. Conversely, if beta or prevalence decreases, mobility can be relaxed earlier without substantially increasing epidemic risk. The strategy is adaptive, balancing epidemic control against socioeconomic mobility needs, preserving overall inflow volumes to maintain network connectivity but timing restrictions to minimize imported infections and deaths in Iowa."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policy balances epidemic control and mobility by adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions from each origin state, preserving total flow but redistributing it to reduce infection import risk. States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to their susceptible population and significant inflow (e.g., Arkansas, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee) are assigned strict-first patterns, reducing early-week traffic to curb initial infection import that could seed outbreaks in Iowa. States with moderate or rising infection levels adopt relaxed-first patterns, allowing more traffic early and mid-term but tightening later to anticipate infection increases. States with lower infection pressure and inflow maintain even distribution to support steady mobility and avoid economic disruption. This coordinated approach balances infection pressure across weeks and states, minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Iowa by preventing infection spikes triggered by imported cases. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections are proportional to the product of inbound flow fraction and the ratio of infected individuals to the origin population. By lowering fractions in weeks with higher infection pressure and/or higher inflow, the risk of seeding outbreaks is reduced. Sensitivity analyses show that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more critical to prevent exponential growth. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccination improves, fractions can be relaxed more evenly to restore mobility. This policy is adaptive, balancing epidemic containment with economic and social needs to protect public health in Iowa."

States with higher infected and exposed populations and large inflows (e.g., Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin) adopt a strict-first pattern, restricting flow initially to reduce imported infections and prevent exacerbation of Iowa's epidemic. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflows receive even or relaxed-first allocations to maintain economic and social mobility without significantly increasing importation risk. The quantitative cooperation logic balances risk by adjusting weekly fractions so that total flow remains constant but is shifted to weeks with relatively lower expected importation pressure. This temporal smoothing reduces immediate infection spikes while managing economic impacts. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase in any origin state, stricter early restrictions become more beneficial; if these parameters decrease, more relaxed patterns may be adopted safely. Collectively, this approach minimizes cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Iowa by strategically timing traffic restrictions and relaxations across origin states based on risk profiles and flow magnitudes."

    "notes": "Alabama has a relatively low infected (I=882) and exposed (E=2843) population compared to its large susceptible population (S=4790585). The infection prevalence is moderate, but given the substantial inflow to Iowa (1862.64 daily), imported infections roughly scale as Flow*ft*(I/population). To minimize disease importation, a strict-first pattern is chosen: stronger controls in weeks 1 and 2, gradually relaxing toward week 4. This pattern reflects the need to reduce immediate importation risk while balancing economic and social mobility pressures. The fractions sum to exactly 1 (1.00), validating proper allocation."

A strict-first policy is applied, front-loading restrictions to reduce early seeding in Iowa, with progressive relaxation as prevalence is expected to stabilize or decline. This trade-off balances epidemic control with the need to allow mobility in later weeks. The fractions sum to 1.00, confirming correct distribution."

Origin states with higher infected and exposed prevalence and larger daily inflow to Iowa are assigned stricter controls earlier (strict-first pattern) to reduce immediate seeding risk. This front-loading reduces the epidemic acceleration within Iowa in initial weeks, thereby lowering cumulative disease burden. Conversely, states with lower inflow or prevalence receive even distributions to balance control with mobility needs. The sum of fractions for each origin state equals exactly one, preserving total flow but redistributing weekly proportions to delay or suppress importation peaks. This cooperative, cross-state traffic modulation lowers overall risk more effectively than uniform or relaxed-first policies. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if the infection prevalence or transmission parameter beta increases, stricter early controls would be even more critical to prevent exponential growth. Conversely, if prevalence diminishes or beta reduces, controls can be relaxed sooner to support economic activity. The policy balances epidemic control and mobility by targeting importation timing and quantity, leveraging heterogeneous state risk profiles and flow magnitudes. This nuanced approach optimally mitigates Iowa's disease burden over the next four weeks."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocation across all origin states balances minimizing imported infections and deaths with maintaining mobility for economic and social needs. States with higher infected and exposed proportions relative to susceptible populations, such as Arkansas, Idaho, Utah, and Tennessee, receive stricter early-week controls (strict-first pattern) to reduce early importation risk while gradually relaxing controls in later weeks. This timing reduces the cumulative exposure of Iowa to incoming infections when local prevalence could be higher. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure or very large populations and flows, like Nebraska and Texas, are assigned relaxed-first or even distributions allowing increased flow later when epidemic control and immunity in Iowa may have improved, reducing overall risk. The even patterns are reserved for states with moderate infection levels and high flows, ensuring stable control without abrupt restrictions that could disrupt mobility. The fractions for each state sum exactly to 1, ensuring total inbound flow remains unchanged over the four weeks, satisfying flow consistency constraints. This cooperative allocation manages temporal infection risk and balances trade-offs between epidemic control and mobility. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early-week control fractions should be increased to mitigate importation risk. Conversely, if local outbreak control improves significantly, more relaxed patterns would be feasible to restore mobility. Overall, this allocation strategy optimizes the timing and intensity of traffic restrictions from diverse origin states, collectively reducing Iowa's cumulative confirmed and deceased cases while preserving necessary mobility."

    "notes": "Alabama has a large susceptible population (4,883,910) with relatively low exposed (1,306) and infected (385) counts compared to its population, implying moderate current infection pressure. Given the daily inbound flow to Iowa (1973.39), the expected imported infected can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I/S+E+I+Q+R+D), which is roughly Flow * ft * (385/around 4,900,000), indicating a low infection import rate. We choose a strict-first pattern by allocating lower fractions in the first weeks (0.35 and 0.30) and relaxing later (0.20, 0.15) to reduce early importation risk while allowing gradual mobility recovery. The trade-off balances early epidemic control with mobility needs later. The fractions sum to exactly 1, validating the allocation."

    "notes": "Arizona's population is large (7,247,763 susceptible) with moderate exposed (1,666) and infected (494). The infection pressure is slightly higher than Alabama's due to higher I count. The high inbound flow (4513.64) into Iowa raises risk of imported infections approximated as Flow * ft * (I/total population). We adopt a strict-first pattern to reduce early week flows (0.40, 0.30) then strongly restrict week 4 (0.10), to control incoming infected cases early. This pattern reduces total infection import while maintaining mobility gradually. Fractions sum to 1, ensuring full flow distribution."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations for Iowa from each origin state collectively emphasize early strict control for states with higher infection prevalence or significant inbound flow, while allowing gradual relaxation in later weeks to balance epidemic control and mobility needs. This approach minimizes initial infection importation risk when local prevalence is low and the state's healthcare capacity is vulnerable. States with very high inbound flow like Minnesota and Nebraska have stricter early controls to prevent overwhelming importation, while those with lower flow or infection pressure adopt even or mild strict-first patterns for steady management. Quantitatively, imported infected cases scale with inbound flow multiplied by the infected fraction of the origin population and the weekly fraction ft. By front-loading stricter controls (lower ft) for high-risk states and weeks, we reduce the cumulative imported infections and subsequent spread in Iowa. The balance between epidemic control and economic mobility is addressed by gradually relaxing controls, allowing essential travel and commerce to resume with caution. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence rises in origin states or transmission rate beta increases, the strict-first pattern remains robust, as early strict controls prevent large import spikes. Conversely, if beta or prevalence falls, slightly more relaxed policies could be justified. The allocations sum precisely to 1 for each origin state, ensuring all inbound flows are accounted for without artificial reduction or inflation. Overall, this coordinated inter-state approach strategically mitigates Iowa's epidemic risk through temporal and spatial traffic control adjustments, optimizing public health outcomes while preserving essential mobility."

The daily average inflow to Iowa is relatively low (2538.6), but imported infections can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/population). Given stable infection levels with a slight risk early on, a strict-first pattern is chosen to reduce early seeding of infections in Iowa. Early reductions in traffic (weeks 1 and 2 at 30% each) allow Iowa to manage imported cases better, while weeks 3 and 4 are relaxed moderately (20% each) as the epidemic burden stabilizes. This pattern balances epidemic control and mobility by frontloading restrictions to delay introduction. The fractions sum exactly to 1.00."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies for Iowa's inbound traffic from all origin states aim to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically allocating weekly flow fractions that sum to 1 for each state. High-infection states with substantial exposed populations and moderate-to-high inflow volumes (e.g., Indiana, Michigan, Tennessee, South Carolina) are assigned a strict-first pattern, emphasizing heavier restrictions in the initial weeks to reduce early seeding of infections in Iowa. This frontloading of traffic control prevents sudden surges and allows Iowa's health system to manage cases effectively. States with relatively stable infection prevalence and large susceptible populations but very high inflow volumes (e.g., Nebraska, Texas, Wisconsin) are assigned even traffic controls to maintain consistent epidemic control without abrupt mobility disruptions, balancing economic activity and infection risks. For states with moderate infection pressures but variable inflow, relaxed-first patterns are used to allow gradual adaptation of controls, distributing risk and preserving economic functions. The quantitative logic underlying these allocations is based on estimating imported infections as proportional to the product of inbound flow, fraction allocated to a week, and the proportion of infected individuals in the origin state's population. By adjusting weekly fractions rather than total flow, the model preserves mobility volume while timing restrictions to periods of higher infection pressure or vulnerability. This temporal balancing reduces cumulative epidemic impact in Iowa. Sensitivity to prevalence and transmission rates (beta) suggests that if infection prevalence in origin states or transmission rates increase, stricter early restrictions or longer durations of reduced flow may be warranted. Conversely, improvements in epidemic control or vaccination coverage may allow relaxation of traffic controls earlier. Cross-state cooperation in timing controls ensures that peak mobility from multiple high-risk states does not coincide, preventing simultaneous importation peaks. Overall, these policies provide a calibrated approach balancing epidemic control and economic mobility in Iowa's inbound traffic."

This reduces seeding of new infections in Iowa when its own infected population is still substantial (I=722). States with lower infection prevalence or lower inflows are assigned even traffic distribution to maintain economic activity with manageable risk. The total inbound flow from each origin state remains constant over the 4 weeks, preserving overall mobility but shifting its temporal distribution to avoid epidemic surges. This cooperative balancing reduces peak imported infections and delays epidemic growth, allowing Iowa's health system to better manage cases. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases in origin states, stricter early controls should be intensified to compensate. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, traffic controls can be relaxed earlier. This policy is adaptive to infection pressure trends, prioritizing epidemic suppression while maintaining necessary mobility. All weekly fractions per state sum exactly to 1, ensuring flow conservation and predictable policy implementation."

  "global_guidance": "The traffic control policy for Iowa optimizes inbound flow fractions per origin state over the next 4 weeks to minimize imported infections and subsequent confirmed and deceased cases. States with high infectious and exposed populations relative to their susceptible population, and high inbound flows, are allocated stricter controls initially (strict-first pattern) to reduce early importations when infection risk is high. This is evident for states like Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Virginia. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or where economic impact is pronounced are managed with relaxed-first or even patterns to balance mobility and epidemic control, such as Arkansas, Mississippi, and Texas. The allocation ensures the total inbound flow from each origin remains constant over 4 weeks, merely redistributing weekly fractions to shift risk away from early weeks to later weeks when epidemic control is more effective or risk is lower. This quantitative cooperation logic balances epidemic risk across states and weeks, reducing peak imported infections and smoothing control efforts. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter front-loaded controls would be more beneficial to prevent early seeding of infections. Conversely, lower prevalence allows more even or relaxed-first patterns. The policy reflects a trade-off between minimizing epidemic spread and preserving mobility and economic activity, ensuring fractions sum exactly to 1 for each state to maintain total flow. This coordinated, data-driven approach maximizes public health benefit while acknowledging social and economic constraints."

The imported infected cases can be approximated by Flow*ft*(I/population), so with a relatively low I/population ratio, the infection risk from Alabama is moderate. The inbound flow is 1960.64 daily on average, and evenly distributing traffic over the 4 weeks balances mobility needs and epidemic control without concentrating risk in any particular week. The infection pressure is steady, so an even allocation (even pattern) is justified to avoid spikes in imported cases and allow consistent monitoring. Trade-offs include maintaining economic and social mobility while not overwhelming Iowa's health system with sudden infection import surges. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.25+0.25+0.25+0.25=1), meeting constraints."

The average inbound flow is 6153.86 daily. Imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/population), so early weeks with lower fractions reduce imported infections when Arizona's infections might be more impactful. The fractions follow a relaxed-first pattern (lower at start, increasing over time) to reflect potential improvement in Arizona's epidemic situation or to delay imported infections to later weeks when Iowa may have better capacity. This helps flatten the imported infection curve and reduces immediate risk to Iowa. The trade-off is some economic slowdown early but safer epidemic control.

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocations prioritize reducing imported infections from origin states with high infection pressure and/or large inbound flows by front-loading stricter controls (lower fractions) in early weeks. States like Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Texas, Nebraska, and Minnesota with high infected counts and/or massive inbound flows have stricter initial controls to minimize early importation risk, allowing Iowa time to manage and contain infections. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure or smaller flows have even or relaxed-first patterns to balance mobility and control. The total daily inflow from each origin is conserved over 4 weeks by strictly ensuring fractions sum to 1. This cooperation logic balances infection risks across states and weeks, avoiding overwhelming Iowa's healthcare capacity at any time. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence (I/population) or transmission rate beta increases in some states, stricter front-loading controls become even more critical to reduce cumulative cases and deaths in Iowa. Conversely, if beta or prevalence decreases, a more relaxed traffic pattern may be feasible. The recommended staggered allocations aim to flatten the imported infection curve, reduce epidemic peaks, and preserve essential mobility and economic activity, achieving an optimal trade-off in epidemic control and mobility policy for Iowa."

States like Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Texas, Nebraska, and Minnesota with high infected counts and/or massive inbound flows have stricter initial controls to minimize early importation risk, allowing Iowa time to manage and contain infections. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure or smaller flows have even or relaxed-first patterns to balance mobility and control. The total daily inflow from each origin is conserved over 4 weeks by strictly ensuring fractions sum to 1. This cooperation logic balances infection risks across states and weeks, avoiding overwhelming Iowa's healthcare capacity at any time. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence (I/population) or transmission rate beta increases in some states, stricter front-loading controls become even more critical to reduce cumulative cases and deaths in Iowa. Conversely, if beta or prevalence decreases, a more relaxed traffic pattern may be feasible. The recommended staggered allocations aim to flatten the imported infection curve, reduce epidemic peaks, and preserve essential mobility and economic activity, achieving an optimal trade-off in epidemic control and mobility policy for Iowa."

  "global_guidance": "Across all origin states, inbound traffic control policies are tailored according to each state's epidemic risk and flow volume to Iowa. States with higher infection (I) and exposed (E) populations relative to their size, and high inbound flows, receive stricter early restrictions (lower fractions in weeks 1 and 2) to curb immediate importation risk. This strict-first pattern is applied to major contributors like Arkansas, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Wisconsin, as they pose significant threats to Iowa's epidemic control. Lower-risk or smaller flow states are assigned even or relaxed-first patterns to balance economic and social needs. The sum of fractions equals exactly 1.000 for each origin state, ensuring total inbound flow remains unchanged over four weeks but redistributed to minimize peak importation risk. This redistribution flattens importation peaks, reducing secondary transmission and deaths within Iowa. Quantitatively, imported infected cases scale approximately with Flow * ft * (I/population) of the origin states, so controlling ft early when infection prevalence is high reduces total imported infections. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence increases or transmission rate beta rises, stricter early controls become more critical; conversely, with lower beta or prevalence, more relaxed patterns are possible. Cooperation across states by staggering inbound traffic reduces simultaneous high importation pressure, effectively lowering Iowa's epidemic peak and cumulative burden. The balance between epidemic control and mobility ensures essential flows continue while protecting public health. This approach is robust to moderate changes in parameters and provides a pragmatic, data-driven policy framework for multi-week traffic control to reduce COVID-19 spread into Iowa."

    "notes": "Alabama shows moderate infection levels with I=1117 and E=3613 relative to a large susceptible population S=4762746. The imported infected cases roughly scale with Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)) where decreasing ft early reduces early importation risk. Given Alabama's moderate infection pressure and relatively large inflow, a relaxed-first pattern allocating lower traffic fractions early (f1=0.20) and gradually increasing allows initial strict control to prevent seeding while balancing mobility needs later as the epidemic may stabilize. The total fractions sum to 1. This approach balances epidemic control and mobility by front-loading restrictions when risk is higher, reducing potential imported cases and deaths in Iowa."

To minimize early import risk, a strict-first pattern with higher initial restriction (f4=0.20 relaxed last week) reduces infections brought into Iowa early on. The fractions sum to 1 exactly. This pattern sacrifices some later mobility for early epidemic control, as Arizona's infection pressure could seed outbreaks if unrestricted early. Balancing the trade-off, this phased approach reduces cumulative infections and deaths in Iowa while allowing some relaxation later."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively minimize imported infections and deaths in Iowa, the traffic control policies prioritize stricter early-week restrictions (strict-first pattern) for states with high infection prevalence and large inflow volumes, such as Wisconsin, Minnesota, Arkansas, Michigan, and Nebraska. These states pose the highest risk of seeding infections into Iowa early, which could rapidly amplify local epidemics due to disease transmission dynamics characterized by beta=0.142 and other SEIRD parameters. Conversely, states with low infection prevalence and moderate or low flow, such as Mississippi, Kentucky, and South Carolina, have even traffic allocations balancing control and mobility to avoid undue economic disruption. The cooperation logic involves distributing restrictions temporally and spatially to flatten the influx of infected individuals, avoiding overwhelming Iowa's local health system while maintaining essential mobility. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence increases or transmission rate beta rises, front-loading stricter controls becomes even more critical to prevent exponential outbreak growth. Conversely, if prevalence drops or beta decreases, more uniform or relaxed patterns may suffice. The 4-week fractions for each origin state sum exactly to 1, ensuring total inbound traffic volume remains constant as required, but the temporal distribution is optimized for epidemic risk mitigation. This coordinated approach across origin states leverages infection data and flow volumes to systematically reduce cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Iowa while balancing societal mobility needs."

    "notes": "Alabama's average past 28-day infected population (I=385) compared to its total population (approx. 6,428,665) indicates a relatively low infection prevalence. The expected imported infections can be roughly estimated as inflow * fraction_t * (I / population). Given the low prevalence and steady inflow (1973 daily), an even distribution of traffic control across four weeks is reasonable. This avoids sudden spikes in imported cases and balances mobility needs. The even pattern (equal fractions of 0.25 each) ensures consistent control and smooth flow, reducing potential surges. The sum of fractions equals exactly 1, ensuring total inflow remains constant."

The expected imported infections scale with daily inflow (4514) and fraction allocation. The infection pressure appears to be steady but slightly increasing, suggesting some relaxation in later weeks could be feasible. Thus, a strict-first pattern with lower fractions in early weeks (0.20,0.20) and relaxed later (0.30,0.30) is chosen to minimize early imported infections when local Iowa prevalence is higher, allowing more mobility later.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policy for Iowa strategically balances epidemic control and mobility by allocating inbound traffic fractions for each origin state over four weeks. States with higher infection prevalence (high I and E values) and smaller populations, such as Idaho, Arkansas, South Carolina, and Utah, are assigned strict-first patterns that impose stronger traffic restrictions during the initial weeks to minimize importation of infectious individuals when Iowa's local epidemic is more sensitive. This approach helps reduce the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by preventing early seeding of infections. For states with moderate or low infection prevalence but significant daily inflow, such as Minnesota, Nebraska, and Wisconsin, even traffic allocation patterns are recommended to maintain steady inflow without causing spikes in infections or undue economic disruption. The quantitative cooperation logic leverages the fact that the total inbound flow from each origin state remains constant over the four weeks, but shifting the weekly fractions allows Iowa to time restrictions to periods of higher local vulnerability or epidemic sensitivity. This prevents overwhelming the local healthcare system while sustaining necessary mobility. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early restrictions would be warranted, potentially shifting more traffic allocation to later weeks or lowering early fractions further. Conversely, if local Iowa epidemic control improves rapidly, relaxation could be accelerated. Overall, this balanced, data-driven allocation mitigates imported infection risk while preserving essential mobility and economic activity."

The imported infected cases roughly scale with Flow*ft*(I/S+E+I+Q+R+D). Since Alabama's infected count is moderate and flow to Iowa is 2538 daily, we apply a strict-first pattern to reduce incoming infections early. We allocate lower fractions in week 1 (0.30), slightly relaxing control in weeks 2 and 3 (0.25 each), and the most relaxed in week 4 (0.20). This balances epidemic control by front-loading restrictions when risk is highest while eventually allowing mobility. The fractions sum to exactly 1, validating the allocation."

The sum of fractions for each state is carefully maintained at 1 to ensure total inbound flow remains constant over 4 weeks, satisfying constraint requirements. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence increases or beta (transmission rate) rises, stricter early reductions would yield more benefit by reducing early imported infections. Conversely, if prevalence falls or beta decreases, more relaxed distributions could be feasible without increasing risk.
