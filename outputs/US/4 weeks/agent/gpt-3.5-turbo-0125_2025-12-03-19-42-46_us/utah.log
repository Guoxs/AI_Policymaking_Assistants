    "notes": "Alabama has a large susceptible population (4,883,910) with relatively low exposed (1,306) and infected (385) counts, but a high confirmed (14,562) indicating many known cases. The importation risk can be approximated as imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population). The infected proportion is low, so strict control in the initial weeks can reduce early imported cases, hence a strict-first pattern (lower fractions initially) is chosen. This reduces early seeding in Utah, helping to minimize cumulative cases. Balancing mobility, the later weeks are relaxed to allow economic activity once initial risks have been mitigated. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.3+0.3+0.2+0.2=1)."

Given the very large daily inflow (25,219.75), the importation risk is significant and approximated by imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population). The infected proportion is moderate, suggesting a balanced approach. A relaxed-first pattern is chosen to slightly ease early flow (week 1 fraction 0.2) but increase in weeks 2 and 3 (0.3 and 0.3) to balance mobility and risk. Week 4 is tightened again to prepare for potential late outbreaks. This pattern balances epidemic control and mobility over 4 weeks while summing fractions to exactly 1."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations collectively reduce expected imported infections and deaths in Utah by prioritizing stricter control during early weeks for origin states with higher infection prevalence or significant inflow. The strict-first pattern applied to most states with moderate to high infection burdens reduces early seeding of infections, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths. For states with very large inflow but moderate infection prevalence, a relaxed-first pattern balances economic mobility needs with manageable risk. Even patterns are used for states with stable, low, or moderate infection pressure to maintain consistent control without abrupt mobility disruptions. This cross-state approach leverages quantitative cooperation logic: by staggering stricter controls in early weeks for high-risk states and relaxing later, while allowing steady flow from low-risk states, the overall importation risk is minimized over the 4-week horizon without significant mobility loss. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence increases or transmission rate beta rises, stricter early controls should be intensified especially for high inflow states. Conversely, reductions in prevalence or transmission allow more relaxed allocations. This flexible framework adapts to evolving epidemic trends and balances public health and economic considerations across states and weeks, ensuring the fractions sum exactly to 1 for valid traffic distribution."

    "notes": "Alabama's infection prevalence is relatively low (I=457 out of ~4.86 million), indicating moderate risk for imported infections. Given the flow of 1240 daily into Utah, expected imported infections roughly scale as Flow * fraction * (I / population). The I/population ratio is very small (~9.41e-5), so even the full flow is a moderate risk. We choose an even pattern (equal fractions) because Alabama's infection pressure is steady and low, so delaying or front-loading restrictions provides limited benefit. The trade-off favors balanced mobility for economic and social needs while maintaining control. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.25*4)."

The imported infected scale as Flow * fraction * (I / population). Given risk, we adopt a relaxed-first pattern, allocating more flow later weeks (3 and 4) when possibly Utah's local infections may be better controlled and to avoid overwhelming resources early. Early weeks have stricter control (lower fractions) to reduce initial imported cases. This balances epidemic control with economic activity. Fractions sum to 1 exactly."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic control policies for Utah strategically allocate the fixed total inbound flow for each origin state over four weeks to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. States with higher infection prevalence (I/population) and larger daily inflow to Utah receive stricter control in early weeks (lower fractions) to reduce initial imported infections that seed local outbreaks. This staggered approach delays or reduces peak pressures on Utah's healthcare system and facilitates contact tracing and containment. States with lower infection pressure or smaller flows are assigned even distributions to maintain balanced mobility and economic activity. The cooperation logic across states ensures that the total imported infection risk is spread over time, minimizing simultaneous import surges from multiple sources. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls and longer duration restrictions become more critical to prevent exponential case growth. Conversely, if local control in Utah improves, later weeks can see relaxed inbound flow. This dynamic allocation approach balances epidemic control and mobility, aiming to reduce cumulative infections and deaths while acknowledging economic and social necessities. All allocations sum exactly to 1 for each state, satisfying constraints and ensuring feasibility."

  "global_guidance": "The overall traffic control policy for Utah strategically balances epidemic risk from multiple origin states with the necessity to maintain socio-economic mobility. States with higher infection pressure, such as Arizona, Idaho, and Arkansas, employ a strict-first pattern, imposing stronger restrictions in the initial weeks to curb early importation of exposed and infected individuals. This approach reduces the seeding of new cases in Utah, particularly critical given Utah's own moderate infection levels. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or larger susceptible populations, such as Alabama, Indiana, and Texas, have even or relaxed-first patterns to facilitate steady mobility while maintaining control. Across all states, the total inbound flow over the 4 weeks remains constant, preserving baseline travel volumes but optimizing weekly distribution to flatten infection risk peaks. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections approximate Flow*ft*(I/population), so front-loading restrictions where infection prevalence is highest effectively reduces cumulative cases and deaths in Utah.

States with higher infection pressure, such as Arizona, Idaho, and Arkansas, employ a strict-first pattern, imposing stronger restrictions in the initial weeks to curb early importation of exposed and infected individuals. This approach reduces the seeding of new cases in Utah, particularly critical given Utah's own moderate infection levels. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or larger susceptible populations, such as Alabama, Indiana, and Texas, have even or relaxed-first patterns to facilitate steady mobility while maintaining control. Across all states, the total inbound flow over the 4 weeks remains constant, preserving baseline travel volumes but optimizing weekly distribution to flatten infection risk peaks. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections approximate Flow*ft*(I/population), so front-loading restrictions where infection prevalence is highest effectively reduces cumulative cases and deaths in Utah. The policy also considers trade-offs; overly strict controls everywhere would unduly disrupt mobility and economic activity, while too relaxed controls risk overwhelming Utah's health system. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if local prevalence or transmission parameters (beta) rise, stricter early restrictions may be warranted, while lower prevalence permits more relaxed patterns.

The imported infected flow can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/S), which justifies reducing traffic in earlier weeks to curb potential seeding in Utah. Given relatively stable infection rates, a strict-first pattern is chosen, reducing inbound flow more in the first two weeks (fractions 0.30, 0.30) then relaxing control later (0.20, 0.20).

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations for Utah collectively aim to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically balancing epidemic control and mobility across all origin states. States with higher infection prevalence (I) and exposure (E) relative to susceptible (S) populations, especially those with significant inbound flow to Utah, are assigned stricter traffic reductions in the earlier weeks (strict-first pattern) to reduce early seeding risk. For example, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, and New Mexico show higher infection pressures and thus have front-loaded restrictions. Conversely, states with stable or moderate infection levels and large flows, such as Arizona, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin, receive even distribution of traffic flow to maintain consistent mobility while managing risk. Texas and Idaho, due to their large flow volumes and potentially increasing infection pressure, have relaxed-first or gradually increasing patterns to balance the need for economic activity with risk mitigation. This cooperative allocation across states and weeks ensures staggered importation risk, preventing simultaneous importation peaks that could overwhelm Utah's healthcare system. Quantitatively, the imported infected cases from each state are approximated as Flow*ft*(I/S), so modulating ft over weeks distributes infection risk temporally to optimize epidemic control. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls should be intensified to avoid exponential growth. Conversely, if local Utah epidemic control improves or vaccination increases, traffic can be relaxed sooner. The fractions for each state sum exactly to 1, ensuring total inbound flow over 4 weeks remains constant, complying with constraints. This balanced approach minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Utah while preserving necessary mobility."

    "notes": "Alabama shows relatively low infected (I=742) and exposed (E=2398) populations compared to its large susceptible base (S=4814658). Given the moderate epidemic pressure and significant flow into Utah (1107.6 daily), imported infections approximate Flow*ft*(I/S), meaning a direct scaling by weekly fraction ft. To minimize Utah's epidemic risk, a strict-first pattern is chosen: stronger restrictions in weeks 1 and 2 (fractions 0.30 each) reduce early imported cases when Utah's own infections are high (I=9084), with gradual relaxation weeks 3 and 4 (0.20 each). This balances epidemic control and mobility by front-loading restrictions to blunt initial case seeding, while allowing some mobility later. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000, validating the allocation."

It has a high average daily inflow to Utah (26226.96), thus posing a significant importation risk. Imported infected scale as Flow*ft*(I/S), so reducing early week flows is critical. A strict-first pattern is adopted with 35% inbound flow in week 1, decreasing to 15% in week 4. This front-loads restrictions when Utah's internal cases are still high, minimizing compounded risk. The trade-off sacrifices some early mobility to protect Utah's population, with cautious easing later. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000, ensuring flow consistency."

Daily flow into Utah is moderate (1122.68). Considering this, a near-even pattern with slight strictness early (25% week 1) and moderate relaxation later balances epidemic risk and mobility.

Its daily inflow to Utah is very large (37996.71), representing a major source of imported infections. Therefore, a strict-first pattern with 20% flow week 1, slowly relaxing to 30% week 3, then 25% week 4 is chosen to minimize early seeding while allowing gradual mobility recovery. This approach minimizes cumulative cases and deaths in Utah by controlling the highest risk period. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "The traffic control policy collectively applies stricter control in the early weeks for states with higher infected and exposed populations relative to their size and flow to Utah, thus reducing the early importation of infections that could seed local outbreaks. The relaxed-first pattern dominates for most origin states, balancing initial epidemic suppression with gradual restoration of mobility, mitigating economic and social impacts. This approach addresses the trade-off between minimizing cumulative infections and supporting mobility demands. The flow fractions per origin state sum to exactly 1, ensuring no net change in total inbound traffic volume over the 4 weeks, preserving mobility baselines. Risk balancing is achieved by allocating lower fractions in weeks 1-2 for high-risk states (e.g., Michigan, Texas, Arkansas) and higher fractions in later weeks, while lower-risk states have more even distributions. This cross-state coordination reduces overall imported infection pressure on Utah's susceptible population. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, more stringent early restrictions (lower f1 and f2) may be necessary, while reductions in prevalence allow for more relaxed allocations. The policy is adaptive and can be updated as new epidemiological data arrives, maintaining optimal balance between epidemic control and mobility."

    "notes": "Alabama has a relatively low number of infected individuals (I=1087) compared to its large susceptible population (S=4762006). Given the low infection prevalence (~I/S), the imported infected cases from Alabama to Utah are expected to be modest, proportional to Flow*ft*(I/S). The average daily inflow is 1296.2, so total four-week inflow is approximately 36269. Given this, a uniform weekly allocation (even pattern) is reasonable to balance mobility and control. Strict controls early could be disproportionate given the stable low infection pressure, and relaxing traffic early could risk seeding infections. The even pattern mitigates risk without heavy disruption. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.25*4=1)."

The baseline inflow is high (29856.75 daily), meaning imported infected cases scale with Flow*ft*(I/S). Given the increasing trend in E and I, a relaxed-first pattern is chosen: stricter controls initially (f1=0.15, f2=0.20) to prevent early seeding, gradually relaxing (f3=0.30, f4=0.35) as control measures and Utah's internal immunity improve.

Therefore, a strict-first pattern is optimal: strong traffic restrictions early (f1=0.10, f2=0.15) to reduce early seeding, then gradual relaxation as the situation improves or internal controls strengthen (f3=0.30, f4=0.45).

  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic control policy across all origin states is designed to minimize imported infections and deaths in Utah by strategically allocating inbound flows over the next 4 weeks. States with higher infection prevalence and higher daily inflow volumes, such as Idaho, Arizona, and Texas, are assigned stricter controls early in the period (lower fractions in weeks 1 and 2) to reduce seeding new infections in Utah, followed by relaxation in later weeks as internal controls and immunity improve. Conversely, states with low infection prevalence or low inflow adopt even or relaxed-first patterns with more balanced or increasing fractions over time. This cross-state cooperation is grounded in quantitative logic: imported infected cases scale as Flow*ft*(I/population), so lowering ft during peak infectious pressure weeks reduces overall imported infections. Balancing mobility needs and epidemic control is critical; overly strict restrictions risk economic and social costs, while lax controls risk increased cases and deaths. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls and longer duration restrictions would be necessary, especially for high-risk origin states. Conversely, if prevalence declines or vaccination/immunity improves, traffic can be relaxed earlier. The policy ensures that for each origin state, the total four-week inbound flow remains constant (sum fractions=1), preserving total mobility volume but redistributing it temporally to flatten and reduce disease importation risk. This coordinated temporal allocation reduces the epidemic burden in Utah while maintaining essential mobility."

  "global_guidance": "The overall traffic control policy for Utah balances the incoming infection risk from 19 origin states by tailoring weekly traffic fractions based on each state's infection prevalence and population size. States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to their susceptible populations adopt a strict-first pattern, reducing inbound flow significantly in week 1 to minimize early importation of infectious individuals. This helps to flatten potential spikes in cases within Utah. States with lower infection pressure adopt even or relaxed-first patterns to maintain mobility while controlling risk. The total inbound flow from each origin state remains constant over the 4 weeks, preserving economic and social connectivity but redistributing it to minimize cumulative infections and deaths. Quantitatively, expected imported infections scale approximately as Flow * ft * (I / population), so reducing ft in weeks when infection prevalence or transmission risk is high reduces case importation. This cooperation across states smooths infection importation and prevents simultaneous peaks. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases in any origin state, stricter early-week controls should be implemented to prevent rapid epidemic seeding in Utah. Conversely, if prevalence falls, controls can be gradually relaxed.

States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to their susceptible populations adopt a strict-first pattern, reducing inbound flow significantly in week 1 to minimize early importation of infectious individuals. This helps to flatten potential spikes in cases within Utah. States with lower infection pressure adopt even or relaxed-first patterns to maintain mobility while controlling risk. The total inbound flow from each origin state remains constant over the 4 weeks, preserving economic and social connectivity but redistributing it to minimize cumulative infections and deaths. Quantitatively, expected imported infections scale approximately as Flow * ft * (I / population), so reducing ft in weeks when infection prevalence or transmission risk is high reduces case importation. This cooperation across states smooths infection importation and prevents simultaneous peaks. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases in any origin state, stricter early-week controls should be implemented to prevent rapid epidemic seeding in Utah. Conversely, if prevalence falls, controls can be gradually relaxed. This dynamic allocation strategy balances public health and economic needs, optimizing epidemic control through coordinated traffic management across origin states and weeks."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, these inbound traffic allocations aim to minimize Utah's epidemic burden by strategically timing traffic restrictions across origin states and weeks. States with higher infection prevalence per capita and high inbound flows receive stricter early-week controls (strict-first pattern), reducing immediate imported infections that could seed outbreaks in Utah. States with lower or more stable infection levels adopt even or relaxed-first patterns to balance epidemic control with economic and mobility needs. Quantitatively, imported infections roughly scale as Flow*ft*(I/Population), so adjusting ft weekly redistributes risk without altering total flow. This cooperative temporal balancing across states and weeks reduces peak imported infection pressure, allowing Utah's health system to manage cases and reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence (I/Population) rises or the transmission parameter beta increases, stricter early restrictions become more critical to mitigate importation risks. Conversely, if prevalence falls or beta decreases, traffic can be more evenly distributed. This policy thus adapts dynamically to epidemiological states, optimizing epidemic control while preserving mobility as much as possible. These allocations strictly sum to 1 per state, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant, fulfilling constraints and maintaining fairness."

The infection prevalence (I/S) is low, indicating moderate risk. The imported infected cases approximately scale with Flow * ft * (I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)) and since the flow is moderate (1351.57 daily), the risk is manageable. We apply a strict-first pattern, allocating lower fractions early (0.35, 0.30) to reduce immediate importation risk, allowing gradual relaxation as local cases stabilize. This balances epidemic control with socio-economic mobility needs. The fractions sum to 1 exactly (0.35+0.30+0.20+0.15=1)."

  "global_guidance": "Considering the inbound flows from all origin states, the overall strategy aims to minimize imported infections and deaths in Utah by carefully allocating inbound traffic restrictions over the next four weeks. States with higher infection prevalence (I and E relative to S) and larger inbound flows are prioritized for stricter early restrictions to reduce immediate importation risk. For example, Idaho and Arizona have significant infected and exposed populations with high inflows, warranting strict-first patterns to curb early imported infections. Conversely, states with lower infection rates or smaller inflows receive more balanced or even distributions, maintaining reasonable mobility. The cumulative imported infections scale with Flow * ft * (I/total population), so lowering ft in early weeks for high-risk states effectively reduces peak imported infections when Utah's local epidemic is vulnerable. This strategy balances epidemic control and socio-economic mobility by easing restrictions gradually as risk subsides or local control improves. The allocations also consider the interconnectedness of states and temporal dynamics, ensuring no week is overwhelmed by high-risk inflows. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, early strong restrictions become more crucial; if prevalence declines, more relaxed fractions can be allowed earlier. Overall, this coordinated, state-specific, temporally adaptive policy reduces Utah's cumulative confirmed and deceased cases while preserving necessary mobility."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policy for Utah balances epidemic control and mobility by adjusting weekly inbound traffic fractions from each origin state while keeping total 4-week inflow constant. States with higher infected and exposed prevalence relative to susceptible populations and higher inbound flows have stricter early restrictions (strict-first pattern) to minimize imported infections during initial critical periods. This reduces cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by lowering early seeding events and preventing outbreak acceleration. Conversely, states with moderate or lower prevalence but very large inflow, such as Idaho, implement a relaxed-first pattern to accommodate essential cross-border traffic while progressively tightening controls to mitigate later risks. The quantitative logic is based on the formula imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/S), which guides weekly fraction adjustments to reduce imported infection pressure especially when prevalence is high. Trade-offs involve temporarily restricting mobility to prevent healthcare system overload while allowing phased relaxation to restore economic activities. Cross-state cooperation is crucial: by collectively reducing early week inflows from high-risk states, Utah limits cumulative imported infections more effectively than uniform restrictions. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence (I or E) rises or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become more critical; conversely, if prevalence decreases, mobility can be relaxed earlier. This dynamic allocation strategy optimizes epidemic control under uncertainty and variable state epidemiological contexts. The fractions for each state sum precisely to 1 to ensure total flow consistency. This policy supports Utah's goal of minimizing epidemic impact while maintaining feasible mobility levels."

The exposed (E=2585) suggests some ongoing transmission. Imported infections can be roughly estimated as Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)). Given the moderate infection prevalence, a strict-first pattern is chosen to reduce early-week inflow, mitigating initial seeding risks in Utah. This pattern allows gradual relaxation as the situation stabilizes and earlier infections are detected and controlled.

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Utah, the traffic control policy balances epidemic control with necessary mobility across all origin states collectively. States with higher infection prevalence (I and E) and larger inflows are prioritized for stricter early-week controls (strict-first pattern), reducing initial imported infections that contribute disproportionately to local outbreaks. States with moderate or lower infection pressures and large inflows adopt relaxed-first or even patterns, allowing some early mobility to support economic and social functions while tightening later to prevent late surges. The allocations ensure total 4-week inbound flows remain constant per origin state, preserving overall mobility volumes but redistributing timing to mitigate peak infection importation. Quantitatively, imported infections approximate Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing ft in early weeks for high-risk states lowers risk during vulnerable periods. This cross-state coordination allows balancing risks dynamically, smoothing inflow to avoid overwhelming Utah's control capacities. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early-week controls should be intensified. If prevalence decreases or control improves, traffic can be relaxed earlier.

States with higher infection prevalence (I and E) and larger inflows are prioritized for stricter early-week controls (strict-first pattern), reducing initial imported infections that contribute disproportionately to local outbreaks. States with moderate or lower infection pressures and large inflows adopt relaxed-first or even patterns, allowing some early mobility to support economic and social functions while tightening later to prevent late surges. The allocations ensure total 4-week inbound flows remain constant per origin state, preserving overall mobility volumes but redistributing timing to mitigate peak infection importation. Quantitatively, imported infections approximate Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing ft in early weeks for high-risk states lowers risk during vulnerable periods. This cross-state coordination allows balancing risks dynamically, smoothing inflow to avoid overwhelming Utah's control capacities. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early-week controls should be intensified. If prevalence decreases or control improves, traffic can be relaxed earlier. Overall, this policy reduces seeding events and cumulative cases while maintaining essential mobility, validated by fraction sums equaling one for each state ensuring flow consistency."

The expected imported infected cases roughly follow imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population). Given the large population and low infected ratio, the risk per traveler is moderate. The average daily inflow is 1084.7, fairly significant.

With a large average daily inflow of 25,145.75, imported infections could be substantial, estimated by imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/pop). To mitigate risk early in the 4 weeks, we apply a strict-first pattern with lower fractions initially (0.15, 0.20) and gradually relax controls (0.30, 0.35).

Using imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/pop), it's prudent to adopt a strict-first pattern with low initial fractions increasing over time (0.10 to 0.40).

States with higher infection and exposed counts relative to their populations (e.g., Idaho, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin) and with large average daily inflows to Utah receive stricter control in early weeks (strict-first pattern). This front-loads control efforts when infection pressure is high, reducing initial imported infections that can seed outbreaks in Utah. States with moderate or stable infection prevalence and lower inflows are assigned even traffic allocations to maintain balanced mobility without compromising control. The total inbound flow per state over 4 weeks remains constant, but weekly fractions vary to optimize timing of restrictions and relaxations. This coordinated approach leverages quantitative cooperation logic: reducing flow fractions in weeks of high risk and compensating in later weeks when risk is lower. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls or extended durations would be needed to prevent seeding. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccination improves immunity, more relaxed patterns could be adopted earlier. By integrating SEIQRD epidemic parameters, population compositions, and inflow data, these allocations strategically reduce imported infections and deaths, balancing public health and socio-economic considerations carefully. The sum of fractions for each state is exactly 1, ensuring no deviation from total inbound traffic volumes, only temporal redistribution to optimize epidemic outcomes."

    "notes": "Alabama has a relatively low current infection rate (I=1117) compared to its large susceptible population (S=4762746). The imported infected flow is roughly proportional to Flow * ft * (I / total population), and since the infected fraction is low, the risk of imported infections is moderate. We use an even pattern to balance control and mobility, maintaining consistent moderate restrictions over the 4 weeks. This avoids sudden spikes in imported cases while allowing steady travel. The sum of fractions is 1.000, validating the allocation."

Given the higher inflow and infection pressure, we choose a strict-first pattern, imposing stricter control in the first two weeks (fractions 0.30 each) to reduce initial imported infections and then gradually relaxing. This approach mitigates peak infection importation early on. Imported infected flows relate to Flow * ft * (I / population). The fractions sum to exactly 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic control policy balances epidemic control and mobility by applying stricter inbound restrictions in the initial weeks for states with higher infection prevalence and elevated inflow, while states with lower infection rates or lower inflows maintain even restrictions. This approach minimizes the cumulative imported infected cases during the critical early weeks when controlling spread is most effective. The pattern of strict-first restrictions in high-risk states reduces the initial seeding of new infections, allowing later weeks to relax controls and support economic mobility. Quantitatively, the imported infected cases from each origin state are approximately proportional to the product of daily flow, control fraction, and infected proportion (I/population). By allocating lower fractions (stricter controls) when infection prevalence and flows are highest, we reduce the expected imported infections and subsequent deaths in Utah. The fractions for each state sum to exactly 1, ensuring total inbound flow is conserved over the 4 weeks, meeting the requirement. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence increases or transmission rate beta rises, stricter controls earlier would be even more crucial. Conversely, if prevalence declines, more even or relaxed-first patterns could be considered to enhance mobility. This policy is robust to moderate fluctuations in parameters and prioritizes minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Utah through coordinated cross-state traffic modulation."

    "notes": "Alabama presents a relatively low current infection level (I=385) compared to its large susceptible population (S=4,883,910). The imported infected cases can be approximated by Flow * ft * (I / population). Given the moderate infection prevalence, a balanced even pattern for traffic allocation is suitable to maintain mobility while managing risk. The four weekly fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.25+0.25+0.25+0.25=1), ensuring consistent total flow over 4 weeks. This approach balances epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs, as strict front-loading or easing would not provide significant additional benefits given the stable infection rates."

    "notes": "Arizona has a moderate infection level (I=494) within a large population (S=7,247,763). The higher inflow (24,219.75 daily) implies significant importation risk, proportional to Flow * ft * (I / population). The infection pressure appears stable but slightly rising, recommending a strict-first pattern with lower traffic (f1=f2=0.20) in weeks 1 and 2 to curb early importation, then relaxed in weeks 3 and 4 (f3=f4=0.30) as local conditions improve. Fractions sum to 1 (0.20+0.20+0.30+0.30=1). This balances early epidemic control with later mobility relaxation."

Expected imported infections = Flow * ft * (I / population), suggesting risk is non-negligible. A strict-first approach with lower fractions in week 1 (0.18) and slightly increased weeks 2-4 is advised to mitigate early case importation, exploiting the incubation period for intervention.

Imported infected cases scale with Flow * ft * (I / population). Due to high infection pressure, a strict-first pattern with low early week fractions (0.15, 0.20) is selected to suppress early imported cases, progressively relaxing controls in weeks 3 and 4 (0.30, 0.35).

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce imported infections and deaths in Utah, the traffic control policy strategically balances strict control in earlier weeks and gradual relaxation later, especially for origin states with higher infection prevalence and inflow. The primary quantitative logic is that imported infected individuals scale with the product of inbound flow, weekly fraction, and infection prevalence (I/population) in each origin state. By allocating lower traffic fractions (stricter control) in the first two weeks for high-risk states, early importation is minimized, reducing seeding of local outbreaks. Subsequently, moderate relaxation in weeks 3 and 4 accounts for improved detection, isolation, and local control measures. States with lower infection prevalence or lower inflow maintain more even allocations to preserve mobility with minimal additional risk. This cooperative policy approach optimizes resource use across states and time, mitigating cumulative cases and deaths in Utah. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early-week controls become more critical to prevent exponential growth. Conversely, lower beta or prevalence allows safer relaxation. The phased approach adapts to these dynamics by front-loading restrictions where needed and easing cautiously, balancing epidemic control with economic and social mobility. The policy ensures total inbound flow from each origin state remains constant over 4 weeks, preserving overall travel volume but distributing risk temporally to minimize epidemic impact."
