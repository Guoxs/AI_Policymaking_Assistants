The infected proportion is around 7.9e-5, indicating a moderate infection pressure. The expected imported infected cases roughly scale with Flow*ft*(I/Population). Given the large daily inflow (126789.1) and moderate infection prevalence, a balanced even distribution over the 4 weeks is chosen to avoid overloading any single week and to maintain steady control. This even pattern balances epidemic control and economic mobility by not imposing sudden strict controls that may disrupt traffic and economy.

We adopt a relaxed-first pattern, allowing slightly more traffic in the initial two weeks (30% each), then tightening control in weeks 3 and 4 (20%, 20%).

  "global_guidance": "This policy optimizes inbound traffic allocation into Mississippi by analyzing infection prevalence and mobility volume across all origin states. States with higher infection ratios (I/S) and large inflows are assigned strict-first patterns to reduce early imported infections, minimizing initial seeding of cases in Mississippi. Conversely, states with low infection ratios or small inflows allow more relaxed-first or even patterns to support economic activity without significantly increasing risk. The sum of fractions for each origin state is exactly 1, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant over 4 weeks, preserving mobility baselines.

States with higher infection ratios (I/S) and large inflows are assigned strict-first patterns to reduce early imported infections, minimizing initial seeding of cases in Mississippi. Conversely, states with low infection ratios or small inflows allow more relaxed-first or even patterns to support economic activity without significantly increasing risk. The sum of fractions for each origin state is exactly 1, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant over 4 weeks, preserving mobility baselines. This temporal distribution balances epidemic control and economic needs by avoiding peak importation risks in a single week and smoothing healthcare burdens. Quantitatively, imported infected cases scale as Flow * ft * (I / population), so reducing ft in weeks when infection prevalence is highest curbs case influx. Cross-state cooperation reduces overall imported cases by spreading restrictions efficiently given each state's risk profile.

The imported infected estimate can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/population), indicating that higher flow fractions in earlier weeks increase importation risk. Given the relatively stable but notable infection presence, a strict-first pattern is chosen to front-load stricter control in the initial weeks (f1=0.40, f2=0.30) to reduce early imported infections, then gradually relax. This reduces cumulative infections and deaths in Mississippi by preventing seeding early on. The trade-off is reduced mobility initially, balanced against epidemic control benefits. The fractions sum exactly to 1.0000, meeting constraints."

With the low average inflow (~2604), the impact is moderate but non-negligible. Using the imported infected formula, front-loading strict control (strict-first pattern) reduces early infections effectively. Maintaining lower flow in week 1 and 2 (f1=0.45, f2=0.30) curtails initial seeding, then easing later (f3=0.15, f4=0.10). This balances epidemic control with some mobility relaxation later to sustain economic activity. Fractions sum to 1.0000 exactly."

The substantial average inflow (~28041) to Mississippi necessitates strong early restrictions. Imported infected roughly scales with Flow*ft*(I/population), so a strict-first pattern with heavier reduction early (50% in week 1) strongly suppresses initial infection importation.

  "global_guidance": "The collective strategy for Mississippi is to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by implementing strict-first traffic control patterns across all origin states. This approach front-loads stricter controls in the first two weeks (typically allocating 65-80% of flow in weeks 1 and 2 combined with reduced flow fractions), thereby reducing early importations of infected and exposed individuals, which are critical in seeding local outbreaks. The formula for imported infected approximates as Flow*ft*(I/population), meaning early strict control directly reduces the initial seeding force. After the critical first two weeks, gradual relaxation in weeks 3 and 4 allows partial restoration of mobility to balance economic and social needs. Cross-state coordination is essential as high inflow states with elevated infections (e.g., Tennessee, Alabama, Arkansas) are prioritized with stricter initial reductions due to their high potential impact. States with lower inflow or infection pressure receive proportionally less stringent measures but still follow the strict-first pattern to collectively suppress transmission. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence (I) or transmission rate (beta) increases, front-loading stricter controls early becomes even more critical to prevent exponential growth. Conversely, if prevalence is lower or beta decreases, the model supports potentially more relaxed early controls but with maintained vigilance. This uniform strict-first allocation across states ensures that imported infections are minimized early, thus reducing cumulative cases and deaths in Mississippi, while allowing calculated easing later preserves mobility and economic functions. All fractions strictly sum to 1.0000, ensuring consistent flow allocation across the four weeks per origin state."

    "notes": "Alabama shows a moderate exposed (E=1468) and infected (I=457) population relative to its susceptible population of approximately 4.86 million. The imported infected cases can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/Population), where population is the sum of compartments. Given the relatively stable infection pressure but moderate infected individuals, a slightly relaxed control in week 3 (0.30) is balanced with stricter control in week 1 (0.20) to prevent sudden surges from imported cases. The pattern is a relaxed-first approach since infection pressure may peak or remain stable mid-term. Trade-offs include allowing more mobility in middle weeks to support economic activities while still controlling early and late periods to manage case growth. The fractions sum exactly to 1, validating the allocation."

Imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/Pop). The highest fraction is assigned to week 4 (0.35) reflecting a relaxed-later control pattern, minimizing early traffic to reduce initial imported cases. This strategy balances disease control and mobility by delaying more relaxed measures until later when local conditions in Mississippi may be better controlled.

Using the formula Flow*ft*(I/Population), imported infections can be high. Thus, stricter control in week 1 (0.10) and moderate relaxation later is chosen, a relaxed-later pattern, to reduce initial seeding.

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy across origin states prioritizes minimizing imported infections into Mississippi by allocating stricter traffic controls in weeks with higher expected infection pressure from origin states, while relaxing controls in weeks with lower risk. This temporal staggering of inbound flow fractions distributes imported infection risk, reducing simultaneous seeding events that could overwhelm local public health response. Quantitatively, imported infected travelers are approximated by Flow*ft*(I/Population), so adjusting weekly ft fractions modulates weekly imported cases without changing total flow, preserving economic activity. Cross-state coordination ensures that states with higher infected or exposed populations, e.g., Michigan, Ohio, Arkansas, receive stricter early controls, while states with lower infection pressure or inflow use more balanced patterns. This cooperation reduces cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Mississippi. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more critical, and relaxed controls must be deferred further to avoid surges. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more even or relaxed-first patterns can be adopted to support mobility. This policy balances epidemic control with economic considerations, uses data-driven risk assessments, and maintains total inbound flows constant by adjusting weekly proportions summing exactly to 1 for each origin state."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic control policies aim to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Mississippi by strategically modulating weekly traffic inflow fractions according to the epidemic risk profile of each origin state. States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to their size, such as Arkansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and New Mexico, receive stricter early week controls (lower fractions in weeks 1 and 4) to reduce early seeding of infections into Mississippi, shifting towards relaxation mid-period to balance mobility and economic needs. Conversely, states with stable or lower infection prevalence, such as Alabama, Iowa, South Carolina, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, have even traffic allocation across weeks to maintain steady mobility without exacerbating risk. This differentiation minimizes imported infections by timing restrictions when infection pressure is highest, effectively flattening the imported infection curve over four weeks. Quantitatively, imported_infected is approximated as Flow*ft*(I/population) for each origin state and week; thus, reducing ft in early weeks for high-risk states lowers initial infection seeding. The cooperation among states balances importation risk temporally and spatially, allowing Mississippi to manage its epidemic dynamics more effectively. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) increases in certain states, stricter and earlier restrictions would be warranted to curb importation. Conversely, if prevalence declines or beta reduces, traffic fractions could be relaxed more evenly to support mobility. This adaptive, data-driven policy framework uses epidemiological data and mobility baselines to optimize epidemic control while mitigating economic disruption."

  "global_guidance": "The overall traffic control policy for Mississippi strategically balances epidemic control and mobility by adjusting inbound flow fractions weekly for each origin state, ensuring total flow remains constant over four weeks. States with higher infection prevalence (I/population) and exposed counts receive stricter control in early weeks via a strict-first pattern, minimizing early imported infections that could exacerbate local outbreaks. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure or smaller flows utilize even or relaxed-first patterns to sustain mobility while maintaining reasonable epidemic control. This balancing act leverages the relationship imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), using reduced early fractions (ft) to lower imported infections when risk is highest. Gradually increasing fractions in later weeks supports economic recovery and mobility normalization. Cross-state cooperation is critical; states with large flows and high prevalence, such as Tennessee, Texas, and Ohio, receive more aggressive early restrictions, while low-prevalence states like Nebraska and Utah maintain steadier flows. This coordinated approach reduces cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi by dampening initial infection importation spikes and spreading risk evenly over time. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence increases or transmission rate beta rises, stricter early controls become more vital to prevent exponential case growth. Conversely, if prevalence diminishes or vaccination/immunity improves, more relaxed patterns can be adopted earlier. This dynamic, data-driven allocation ensures that Mississippi's inbound traffic is managed to minimize disease spread while preserving essential mobility, adapting flexibly to evolving epidemic conditions."

    "notes": "Alabama shows a relatively low ratio of infected individuals (I=742) compared to its large susceptible population (S=4,814,658), giving a moderate infection prevalence. The imported infected cases can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/Population), thus evenly distributing traffic reduces sudden infection pressure spikes while maintaining mobility. An even pattern is chosen because Alabama's infection levels are stable without strong increasing or decreasing trends noted. This balances epidemic control by avoiding concentrated inflow in any week, reducing risk of transmission bursts, while allowing steady mobility. The four fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

Given this, a relaxed-first pattern with initially stricter control (f1=0.20) and gradually more relaxed flow in weeks 2 and 3 helps delay and reduce initial risk of imported infections. The formula imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population) shows that reducing early week flows reduces early imported infections when local Mississippi cases are still vulnerable.

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy is to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Mississippi by strategically allocating inbound traffic fractions from each origin state over four weeks. States with higher infection prevalence (high I/S ratio), such as Arkansas, Idaho, Michigan, Ohio, Utah, Wisconsin, Texas, and Tennessee, are assigned a strict-first pattern, lowering inbound flow in the early weeks to reduce initial imported infections when Mississippi's local infections are still significant but manageable. This reduces the risk of new outbreaks stemming from imported cases. States with moderate infection pressure or stable infection rates are allocated more balanced or relaxed-first patterns, allowing some early mobility while preserving epidemic control. The imported infections are roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing early week ft for high-risk states reduces early imported infections, which are more critical due to Mississippi's current infection levels. By balancing restrictions across states and weeks, the policy avoids overwhelming economic impacts and mobility disruption in any single period while collectively reducing infection importation. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more critical, emphasizing early week restriction to minimize imported infections. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, traffic can be more evenly distributed. This cooperative, quantitative balancing ensures that total inbound flows remain constant, preserving essential mobility while maximizing epidemic control in Mississippi."

States with higher infection prevalence (high I/S ratio), such as Arkansas, Idaho, Michigan, Ohio, Utah, Wisconsin, Texas, and Tennessee, are assigned a strict-first pattern, lowering inbound flow in the early weeks to reduce initial imported infections when Mississippi's local infections are still significant but manageable. This reduces the risk of new outbreaks stemming from imported cases. States with moderate infection pressure or stable infection rates are allocated more balanced or relaxed-first patterns, allowing some early mobility while preserving epidemic control. The imported infections are roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing early week ft for high-risk states reduces early imported infections, which are more critical due to Mississippi's current infection levels. By balancing restrictions across states and weeks, the policy avoids overwhelming economic impacts and mobility disruption in any single period while collectively reducing infection importation.

  "global_guidance": "In recommending traffic control policies for inbound flow into Mississippi from multiple origin states, a coordinated approach balances minimizing imported infection risk and allowing mobility. States with higher infection prevalence (high E and I relative to S) are assigned stricter initial controls (lower fractions in early weeks) to reduce early importation risk, given that imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population). This strict-first pattern is evident in high-prevalence states such as Idaho, Utah, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Indiana. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure or more stable epidemics are assigned even patterns to maintain steady flow and economic activity. The relaxed-first pattern is applied where infection pressure is moderate but rising, allowing for phased relaxation after initial restrictions. By varying weekly fractions but keeping total 4-week flow constant, the policy maintains overall mobility while timing restrictions to epidemic trends. This coordinated balancing reduces cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Mississippi by lowering early importation risk when local susceptibility is high. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls would be more critical. Conversely, if epidemic control improves or prevalence decreases, more uniform or relaxed allocations could be applied. The approach assumes that infection prevalence data are accurate and that travel restrictions directly reduce imported infections proportional to flow reduction. The sums of fractions for each origin state are validated to exactly 1, preserving total inbound flow as required, ensuring consistency and feasibility of implementation."

    "notes": "Alabama shows a moderate number of infected individuals (I=1087) relative to its susceptible population (S=4,762,006). The risk of importing infections into Mississippi is approximated by Flow*ft*(I/population), where Flow is the inbound flow from Alabama. Given Alabama's relatively stable infection rate but sizable flow (98187.6 daily), a strict-first pattern is chosen to frontload restrictions in the initial weeks (f1=0.40, f2=0.30), progressively relaxing controls as the risk diminishes or as Mississippi's internal control improves. This approach minimizes early imported infections when Mississippi is vulnerable (current I=606). The trade-off balances economic mobility and epidemic control by allowing gradual reopening. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.40+0.30+0.20+0.10=1.00), ensuring the total traffic volume remains constant over four weeks."

The average daily inflow is low (2117.5), so the overall imported infection risk is moderate. An even traffic allocation is suitable here, maintaining consistent controls without sudden spikes in imported risk. This avoids overwhelming Mississippi's health system while preserving steady mobility. The formula imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population) supports equal fractions to steady out the risk. The fractions sum to 1 (0.25*4=1.00). This even pattern balances epidemic containment and mobility, given Arizona's moderate risk and inflow."

The inbound flow is significant (22599.96). The risk of imported infection is higher initially, so a strict-first pattern is appropriate to reduce initial pressure on Mississippi's health system. This means stricter control in weeks 1 and 2 (35% and 30%) and gradually relaxing in weeks 3 and 4. This allocation mitigates early risk while allowing some mobility later.

However, the inbound flow to Mississippi is very low (333.32 daily), so the overall importation risk is limited. A relaxed-first pattern is chosen with moderate early flow to balance minimal impact on mobility while containing risk.

  "global_guidance": "The collective allocation of inbound traffic fractions from all origin states to Mississippi aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically modulating traffic over the next four weeks. States with high infection prevalence and large inbound flows (e.g., Tennessee, Alabama, Arkansas, Texas) adopt a strict-first pattern to frontload restrictions, thus reducing early importation of infections when Mississippi remains vulnerable with moderate active infections. This reduces the initial epidemic pressure and limits secondary transmission chains. Conversely, states with lower inbound flows or moderate infection burdens adopt either even or slight strict-first patterns to balance mobility and risk. The total daily inbound flows remain constant per state over four weeks, but the temporal distribution is shifted to reduce peak importation risk. Quantitatively, imported infected cases scale approximately as Flow*ft*(I/population), making early reduction in ft for high-risk states critical. Risk balancing across states and weeks leverages temporal smoothing to avoid overwhelming health capacity and spread out economic impact. Sensitivity to prevalence and transmission rates (beta) highlights that increases in these parameters would favor even stricter early restrictions, while improvements allow more relaxed patterns. This coordinated approach mitigates epidemic spread while preserving essential connectivity and economic functions."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Mississippi, inbound traffic from all origin states is allocated considering their infection prevalence (I/population) and exposed populations. States with higher infection pressures (Arkansas, Michigan, South Carolina, New Mexico, Oklahoma) adopt strict-first patterns, reducing early week inflows to limit initial importation of infections. States with moderate or stable infection prevalence (Alabama, Minnesota, Utah, Wisconsin) use even patterns to balance epidemic control and economic activity. States with slightly declining or moderate infection levels use relaxed-first patterns, allowing higher early week inflows while tightening controls later to prevent resurgence. This cross-state coordination reduces simultaneous peak importations and distributes risk over time, enhancing Mississippi's capacity to manage cases. The quantitative cooperation logic ensures that total inbound flow per state remains constant, but weekly fractions are adapted to minimize imported infections, proportional to Flow * fraction * (I/population). Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter front-loading controls would be necessary to reduce early importation risks. Conversely, declining prevalence allows more relaxed patterns. This adaptive policy approach balances epidemic control and mobility, aiming to reduce cumulative infections and deaths in Mississippi effectively."

The infected to population ratio is low, indicating moderate risk of imported infections. Expected imported infected individuals are roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/S+E+I+Q+R+D) which is small but non-negligible due to the large flow. We use a relaxed-first pattern by gradually increasing traffic over the weeks from 0.20 to 0.30 in week 3, then slightly relaxing to 0.25 in week 4. This is because the infection pressure is moderate and can be controlled by delaying some traffic to later weeks, allowing the local epidemic in Mississippi to stabilize. The trade-off balances epidemic control with maintaining mobility, avoiding over-restriction early on. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000, validating allocation."

A relaxed-first pattern is chosen to allocate more traffic to later weeks (0.15 early, then 0.25, 0.30, 0.30), deferring inbound flow to weeks when Mississippi's epidemic might be better controlled.

States with higher infected and exposed counts relative to population and with higher flows, such as Arkansas, Michigan, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, and Utah, are subject to strict-first patterns, imposing stronger early week restrictions to reduce initial imported infections. This helps Mississippi to better manage local epidemic dynamics, allowing time for containment and healthcare response.

All fractions sum exactly to 1, ensuring consistent total inbound flow as required. Quantitatively, imported infections are roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/Population), so adjusting ft shapes weekly imported infection pressure. The policy balances epidemic control (lower ft early in high-risk states) with mobility (higher ft later or in lower risk states). Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early week controls would be even more critical to prevent overwhelming Mississippi's health system. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, allocations could be relaxed more evenly. Coordinated temporal allocation of inbound traffic across origin states reduces the risk of simultaneous surges, flattening the imported infection curve and minimizing cumulative cases and deaths."

With a high average daily inflow (145125), the risk of importing infected individuals is significant: imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population). Given the fairly stable but non-negligible infection presence, a strict-first pattern is chosen to reduce initial imported infections, gradually relaxing controls as imported risks decrease. Early weeks have lower fractions (0.35, 0.30) to curb initial importation, easing to 0.20 and 0.15 later. This balances epidemic control with mobility demands, protecting Mississippi from a surge in new cases while allowing some economic activity. The fractions sum exactly to 1, validating the allocation."

  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic control policies for Mississippi's inbound flows are designed to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically modulating restrictions over the next four weeks. States with higher infection prevalence and large inflows—such as Tennessee, Alabama, Arkansas, Ohio, and Indiana—adopt strict-first patterns to reduce early imported infections, which is critical to prevent seeding new outbreaks in Mississippi. Lower risk states or those with stable infection levels use even patterns to maintain consistent moderate control without unnecessarily hampering mobility. This cross-state approach balances epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs. The quantitative logic relies on imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), emphasizing that reductions in early week fractions for high-risk states significantly lower early infection importation pressure, thus reducing downstream cases and deaths. The policy promotes cooperation by staggering restrictions, avoiding simultaneous severe limitations in all states, which helps maintain overall mobility and supply chains. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early restrictions would be needed, especially for high-inflow and high-prevalence origin states. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed patterns could be applied to enhance mobility.

States with higher infection prevalence and large inflows—such as Tennessee, Alabama, Arkansas, Ohio, and Indiana—adopt strict-first patterns to reduce early imported infections, which is critical to prevent seeding new outbreaks in Mississippi. Lower risk states or those with stable infection levels use even patterns to maintain consistent moderate control without unnecessarily hampering mobility. This cross-state approach balances epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs. The quantitative logic relies on imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), emphasizing that reductions in early week fractions for high-risk states significantly lower early infection importation pressure, thus reducing downstream cases and deaths. The policy promotes cooperation by staggering restrictions, avoiding simultaneous severe limitations in all states, which helps maintain overall mobility and supply chains. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early restrictions would be needed, especially for high-inflow and high-prevalence origin states. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed patterns could be applied to enhance mobility. The fraction sums for each state are validated to exactly 1, ensuring consistent total flow while allowing temporal reallocation for strategic risk mitigation."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Mississippi, the recommended traffic control policies prioritize stricter inbound traffic restrictions during the initial weeks for states with higher infection prevalence and significant inbound flow, implementing a strict-first pattern. This approach reduces early seeding of infections when Mississippi's own exposed and infected populations are still manageable, limiting exponential growth triggered by imported cases. States with lower infection levels or smaller inbound flow adopt an even allocation pattern, maintaining mobility without compromising epidemic control. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections from each origin state in week t are proportional to Flow * ft * (I / population), so adjusting ft to be lower in vulnerable periods reduces imported infection pressure. The staggered relaxation (increasing ft) reflects anticipated improvement in local epidemic control and allows economic recovery. Cross-state coordination balances risk by distributing stricter controls where infection pressure is higher, thus collectively reducing the overall imported infection risk into Mississippi. Sensitivity analysis indicates that fluctuations in prevalence or transmission rate beta would affect the optimal strictness timing; higher beta or prevalence would necessitate more aggressive early restrictions, while lower values permit more relaxed patterns. These recommendations carefully balance epidemic control and mobility needs, ensuring the sum of weekly fractions equals exactly one for each origin state, complying with constraints and optimizing public health outcomes."

The expected imported infections scale roughly with Flow * ft * (I / population), where population is approximately the sum of SEIQRD compartments. Since the current infected proportion is fairly steady, an even distribution of traffic (even pattern) over the next 4 weeks minimizes sudden spikes while maintaining mobility flow. Trade-offs include balancing disease control with economic and social needs; overly strict front-loading might cause economic disruption and later spikes.

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocation strategy for Mississippi carefully balances epidemic control and mobility by adjusting weekly traffic fractions from all origin states, ensuring the total 4-week flow remains constant. States with higher infected and exposed proportions relative to their susceptible populations are assigned stricter controls in the initial weeks (i.e., lower fractions) to reduce early imported infections, given the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/population). This approach reduces immediate infection pressure, preventing spikes in local cases and deaths. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure or more stable epidemics receive more even or relaxed-first allocations to maintain economic activity without significantly increasing risk. The cooperation across states is quantitative: by distributing restrictions temporally and spatially, Mississippi avoids overwhelming importation from any single origin at any given time. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls would be even more beneficial. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or immunity rises, allocations could shift towards more relaxed patterns earlier to support mobility. This dynamic allocation approach allows Mississippi to minimize cumulative infections and deaths by smoothing importation risks and sustaining necessary mobility for economic and social functions. The fractions for each state sum exactly to 1, ensuring consistent total inbound flow and compliance with mobility baselines. This coordinated policy thus effectively balances public health and mobility objectives across multiple origin states."

  "global_guidance": "The traffic control policy across origin states for Mississippi is designed to collectively minimize imported infections and deaths by modulating inbound flow fractions weekly while maintaining total flow constant. States with higher infection prevalence or exposed populations are assigned stricter control in early weeks (lower fractions) to reduce immediate importation risk, adopting strict-first or relaxed-first patterns depending on infection trends and epidemic conditions. States with moderate or stable infection levels often receive even flow distribution to balance mobility and epidemic control. This approach leverages cross-state cooperation by smoothing the importation risk across weeks and states, preventing sudden surges that could overwhelm local health systems. Quantitatively, the expected number of imported infections is proportional to the product of inbound flow, weekly fraction, and infection prevalence (I/population). By shifting flow fractions to weeks with lower infection pressure or higher local control capacity, the strategy reduces cumulative infections and deaths. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence (I) or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls become more beneficial to curb early seeding of cases. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta is lower, more relaxed flow patterns can be safely adopted to maintain economic and social activities. Overall, this policy balances epidemic risk reduction with the necessity of maintaining essential mobility and economic function, adapting dynamically to the heterogeneous epidemic landscape across origin states."

Given the daily inflow of 86610, the expected imported infections roughly follow imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population). Alabama's infection pressure appears stable with no sharp recent increases, suggesting a strict-first pattern to reduce immediate imported infections while relaxing controls gradually. The first two weeks have stricter controls (0.30, 0.30) to reduce early seeding, with easing over weeks 3 and 4 (0.20, 0.20) to balance mobility needs. This pattern balances epidemic control by front-loading restrictions to minimize case importation and allows mobility recovery later. The fractions sum to exactly 1, validating the allocation."

The daily inflow is low (1902), so total imported infections are limited but not negligible. The pattern chosen is relaxed-first (0.20, 0.30, 0.30, 0.20) to allow some early mobility while stepping up control mid-period to counter potential infection spikes, then easing again. This balances the risk of early seeding with socio-economic factors. Quantitatively, imported infection risk is proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), so controlling later weeks reduces cumulative risk. The fractions sum to 1 exactly."

Given the large average flow (20599), even distribution (even pattern) of traffic control fractions (0.25 each) is selected to avoid overburdening any single week and to smooth economic impact. This decision reflects a trade-off: strict control all weeks reduces mobility harm but may be impractical, while even distribution provides consistent moderate control.

States with moderate or lower inflow and infection prevalence use even or relaxed-first patterns to maintain economic activity while controlling risk. This cooperative allocation distributes traffic control temporally and across states, reducing cumulative infection importation and allowing adaptive responses to dynamic epidemic trends. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence (I/population) or transmission rate beta increases, stricter front-loading of controls is increasingly beneficial. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed or even allocations maintain economic activity without significant risk. The model assumes consistent reporting and stable mobility baselines; significant deviations would require policy re-optimization.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic control policies for Mississippi strategically allocate inbound flows over four weeks to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. Primary consideration is given to infection prevalence (I) relative to population size in each origin state, combined with the magnitude of inbound flow to Mississippi. States with high infection prevalence and large inflow, such as Tennessee and Alabama, receive stricter control in early weeks to reduce seeding risk when Mississippi's susceptible population is still large and vulnerable. This strict-first pattern is widely adopted, balancing early epidemic suppression with gradual mobility restoration. For states with moderate infection prevalence and lower flow, even or mild strict-first patterns maintain steady control without excessive disruption. The total inbound flow per origin state remains constant, but weekly fractions are adjusted to front-load restrictions where most impactful. This coordinated, cross-state approach reduces overall imported infections, leveraging temporal risk balancing to prevent epidemic surges and healthcare overload. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission parameters (e.g., beta) increase, stricter early restrictions become more critical to avoid exponential spread. Conversely, lower prevalence or effective local mitigation may allow more relaxed allocations. The trade-off between epidemic control and economic-social mobility is managed by gradual easing after initial strict periods, supporting recovery while maintaining public health.

Primary consideration is given to infection prevalence (I) relative to population size in each origin state, combined with the magnitude of inbound flow to Mississippi. States with high infection prevalence and large inflow, such as Tennessee and Alabama, receive stricter control in early weeks to reduce seeding risk when Mississippi's susceptible population is still large and vulnerable. This strict-first pattern is widely adopted, balancing early epidemic suppression with gradual mobility restoration. For states with moderate infection prevalence and lower flow, even or mild strict-first patterns maintain steady control without excessive disruption. The total inbound flow per origin state remains constant, but weekly fractions are adjusted to front-load restrictions where most impactful. This coordinated, cross-state approach reduces overall imported infections, leveraging temporal risk balancing to prevent epidemic surges and healthcare overload. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission parameters (e.g., beta) increase, stricter early restrictions become more critical to avoid exponential spread. Conversely, lower prevalence or effective local mitigation may allow more relaxed allocations. The trade-off between epidemic control and economic-social mobility is managed by gradual easing after initial strict periods, supporting recovery while maintaining public health. This policy framework is robust, adaptive, and grounded in quantitative infection risk modeling, ensuring optimal protection for Mississippi against imported COVID-19 cases and deaths."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound allocations aim to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Mississippi by prioritizing stricter control in early weeks when imported infection risk can seed local outbreaks, especially from states with higher infection prevalence and/or larger inflows such as Tennessee, Alabama, Arkansas, South Carolina, and Texas. The strict-first pattern adopted for these higher-risk states reduces early imported infections approximately proportional to flow * f_t * (I/population), thereby lowering initial epidemic pressure in Mississippi. States with lower infection prevalence and lower inflows, such as Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota, Utah, and Wisconsin, are assigned even flow patterns to maintain mobility without significantly increasing risk. This cross-state risk balancing ensures that total inbound infections are spread over time to avoid overwhelming control capacities. The sum of fractions for each state is constrained to exactly 1.000 to maintain flow consistency with ground truth totals. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence (I/pop) increases in any origin state or the transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls (lower early week fractions) would be even more critical to prevent exponential growth in Mississippi. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta reduces, more relaxed patterns could be employed earlier to support economic mobility. This policy thus dynamically balances epidemic control with socioeconomic needs by leveraging detailed epidemiological and mobility data across all origin states."
