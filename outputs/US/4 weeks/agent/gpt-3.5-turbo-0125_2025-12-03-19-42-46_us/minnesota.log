  "global_guidance": "The overall inbound traffic control strategy for Minnesota balances epidemic control and mobility by adjusting weekly flow proportions from each origin state based on their infection prevalence, exposure levels, and baseline inflow volumes. States with higher infection and exposure levels relative to population, such as South Carolina, Idaho, and Arkansas, are subject to stricter traffic control in the first two weeks (strict-first pattern) to reduce imported infections during the critical initial period. This helps prevent seeding new outbreaks in Minnesota when local susceptibility remains high. Conversely, states with lower infection rates or larger populations but moderate prevalence, such as Texas and Iowa, adopt a relaxed-first pattern, shifting flow to mid-period weeks to balance economic activity with epidemic risk. The imported infection risk is approximately proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), guiding the allocation of stricter controls to weeks with higher infection risk. The strategy ensures that for each origin state, the total inbound flow over four weeks remains constant (sum of fractions equals 1), preserving baseline mobility while redistributing it temporally to minimize epidemic impact. This temporal balancing reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths by targeting peak infection pressure periods with stricter controls, thereby flattening the epidemic curve in Minnesota. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become even more critical, emphasizing the need for dynamic policy adjustments. Conversely, if local control improves substantially, some relaxation in later weeks is justified to support economic recovery. The coordinated cross-state approach leverages knowledge of origin state epidemic statuses and mobility patterns to optimize inbound traffic allocation, reducing overall epidemic burden in Minnesota."

The infected proportion relative to the total is low, but the overall high population and inflow (1962.93 daily) imply a persistent risk of imported infectious individuals. The imported infected estimate for week t is roughly Flow*ft*(I/Population), so balancing traffic evenly distributes risk across the four weeks, avoiding spikes that could exacerbate local outbreaks. An even pattern reduces sudden import surges while allowing consistent mobility. This approach balances epidemic control and economic/social mobility without abrupt restrictions. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.25*4=1), validating the distribution."

Given a high daily inflow (7,432.07), the risk of imported infections is meaningful. The increasing fraction pattern (strict-first) reflects an approach to impose stricter controls initially when imported infections could fuel local outbreaks and then gradually relax as local control improves or immunity builds. The expected imported infected per week is Flow*ft*(I/Population), so placing stricter control early reduces initial imported infections, minimizing early epidemic amplification.

With daily inflow at 2,278.61, imported infected will be Flow*ft*(I/Population). A strict-first pattern (higher control in initial weeks) helps mitigate early imported infections when local outbreaks are more vulnerable.

Using imported infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/Population), the infection import risk is significant. A relaxed-first pattern with moderate control initially (0.20) rising mid-weeks (0.30) then slight relaxation balances the need to prevent early spikes and maintain flow.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations for Minnesota from all origin states are designed to collectively minimize the importation of infectious individuals and thereby reduce cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. States with high infected prevalence and/or large flows (e.g., Wisconsin, Iowa, Michigan, Texas) adopt a stricter control pattern in the initial weeks to prevent early seeding of infections in Minnesota, when local epidemic pressure is more vulnerable. This early reduction in flow lowers imported infected cases (proportional to Flow*ft*(I/Population)) and helps flatten the epidemic curve locally. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflows often have even distributions of traffic to balance epidemic control with maintaining economic and social mobility. The cooperation across states balances the timing of restrictions, ensuring Minnesota does not face simultaneous spikes from multiple origins. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence (I) or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become more beneficial, emphasizing the need to dynamically adapt the traffic control fractions. Conversely, if transmission parameters or prevalence decrease, more relaxed patterns could be considered to enhance mobility. The chosen patterns reflect a cautious approach that prioritizes early epidemic control to prevent overwhelming Minnesota's healthcare system while progressively restoring mobility to support economic and social activities. All fractions are validated to sum exactly to 1 for each origin state, ensuring consistent total inbound flow preservation while allowing temporal redistribution to manage risk effectively."

The imported infected estimate for each week can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population), where Flow is the daily inbound flow. Given a moderate infection prevalence, a strict-first pattern is chosen where stricter control (lower fractions) is applied early to reduce initial seeding in Minnesota, then gradually loosening to allow some mobility. This pattern balances epidemic control by reducing early imported infections when local susceptibility is higher and mobility needs. The fractions sum to exactly 1 (0.30+0.25+0.25+0.20=1)."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations collectively aim to minimize imported infections into Minnesota by strategically adjusting weekly fractions per origin state based on their infection prevalence and population. States with higher infected and exposed counts relative to their population and substantial inbound flows (e.g., Arizona, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas) have stricter inbound controls in early weeks (strict-first pattern) to reduce seeding risk when Minnesota's susceptible population is still high. This temporal distribution allows Minnesota to build local immunity and reduce cumulative cases and deaths over time. Lower prevalence states or those with lower inflow (e.g., Arkansas, Mississippi, Nebraska) are assigned even patterns to balance mobility and control, avoiding unnecessary disruptions. Some states with high prevalence but manageable flows (Utah, Idaho) employ relaxed-first patterns, moderating early week mobility but tightening during peak infection risk, reflecting temporal dynamics of infection pressure. The fractions for all states sum to exactly 1, ensuring total inbound flow stays constant while redistributing weekly proportions. This coordinated approach balances epidemic control and economic/mobility needs by reducing early imported cases that could trigger large outbreaks, while allowing gradual mobility restoration. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls would be even more critical to prevent overwhelming cases. Conversely, if prevalence declines, more relaxed patterns could be adopted to support mobility. Overall, these allocations optimize the trade-off between minimizing COVID-19 transmission and supporting economic activity by timing controls to infection dynamics across origin states."

    "notes": "Alabama's population shows relatively low current infection (I=367) compared to its large susceptible population (S=4,847,226). The exposed (E=1,154) is low but not negligible. The expected imported infections are approximately proportional to Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)). Given the moderate infection pressure, a 'strict-first' pattern is chosen, imposing stricter controls in the initial weeks (lower fractions) to quickly reduce importation risk and prevent seeding of new cases in Minnesota. Relaxing controls gradually aligns with potential epidemic improvements or the need for economic and social mobility. This pattern balances epidemic control and mobility by front-loading restrictions to minimize initial impact without completely halting traffic. The fractions sum to exactly 1.00, validating the allocation."

    "notes": "Arizona exhibits a higher number of infected individuals (I=1,126) and exposed (E=3,792) compared to Alabama, indicating higher epidemic risk. However, the baseline inbound flow is relatively large (10,160 daily). A balanced 'even' traffic allocation is selected to maintain steady flow while minimizing sudden spikes in imported infections. The expected imported infections scale as Flow*ft*(I/population), so an even distribution avoids peaks of imported infections that could overwhelm local health systems while preserving mobility. This pattern balances epidemic control and economic needs without extreme fluctuations. The fractions sum exactly to 1.00, ensuring consistency."

  "arkansas": {
    "fractions": [0.35, 0.25, 0.20, 0.20],
    "notes": "Arkansas presents a relatively high infected count (I=2,140) and exposed (E=4,057) with a moderate susceptible population (S=2,969,736). Given the elevated infection prevalence, a 'strict-first' approach is warranted to reduce early importation risk. Higher restrictions in week 1 (fraction 0.35) and moderate relaxation later allow Minnesota to shield against Arkansas' higher epidemic pressure. The imported infections roughly follow Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing early fractions effectively lowers initial imported infections. The trade-off favors epidemic control over mobility initially, with gradual easing. The fractions sum to 1.00 exactly."

Given this moderate infection pressure and a smaller baseline inflow (2,781), a 'strict-first' pattern with slightly balanced initial weeks is chosen to reduce early infection importation while allowing some mobility. The imported infections are proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), so front-loading restrictions helps Minnesota reduce risk while maintaining some flow. Gradual relaxation aligns with potential epidemic control in Idaho and economic considerations. The fractions sum exactly to 1.00."

A 'relaxed-first' pattern is chosen to allow more mobility initially but tighten controls in the mid period where epidemic risk may peak based on trends. This distributes imported infections more evenly over time, preventing large spikes and allowing Minnesota to adapt.

Due to relatively steady infection pressure, an 'even' pattern is chosen to maintain consistent mobility while controlling importation risk evenly across weeks. This approach balances epidemic risk and economic activity without over-constraining any specific week. Imported infections scale as Flow*ft*(I/population), so even fractions prevent sudden surges.

A 'strict-first' pattern reduces early week flows, lowering immediate imported infections (Flow*ft*(I/population)) and allowing Minnesota to prepare for potential cases. Gradual relaxation supports mobility while monitoring epidemic trends. This balances epidemic control and mobility considerations effectively. Fractions sum to 1.00 exactly."

  },
  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies apply a mixture of 'strict-first', 'relaxed-first', and 'even' allocation patterns based on each origin state's infection prevalence and mobility baseline to Minnesota. States with higher infected and exposed populations, such as Arkansas, Michigan, and Tennessee, receive stricter controls in the initial weeks to minimize early imported infections, which are proportional to the product of inbound flow, weekly fraction, and infection prevalence (Flow*ft*(I/population)). This frontloading of restrictions reduces initial epidemic seeding in Minnesota, preventing rapid local spread and reducing cumulative cases and deaths. Conversely, states with more stable or lower infection levels, like Arizona, Iowa, South Carolina, Virginia, and Wisconsin, adopt an even distribution to maintain consistent mobility while controlling risk. Some states with large populations and high flows, like Texas and Ohio, utilize a 'relaxed-first' pattern to balance initial economic mobility with increased mid-term restrictions to mitigate rising epidemic risks. Collectively, these allocations reduce the peak imported infection load on Minnesota's healthcare system by smoothing inflows over time and prioritizing control where infection pressure is highest. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter initial fractions would be necessary to contain imported risk, especially from high-risk states. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, allocations can be relaxed to enhance mobility. This dynamic, data-informed approach balances epidemic control imperatives with social and economic mobility needs across states and weeks, aiming to minimize Minnesota's cumulative confirmed cases and deaths while preserving essential traffic flows."

The imported infected cases are proportional to Flow*ft*(I/Population). Given the inflow of 1573.4 daily, controlling traffic early (strict-first pattern) is prudent to reduce introduction of infections into Minnesota. We allocate higher restrictions in weeks 1 and 2 (fractions 0.35, 0.30) and relax progressively (0.20, 0.15). This pattern balances epidemic control by front-loading restrictions when infection pressure is comparatively higher, and mobility by allowing gradual relaxation.

However, the infection levels are somewhat stable, suggesting an even distribution of traffic control (even pattern).

  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic control strategy across all origin states prioritizes early strict traffic restrictions (strict-first pattern) for states with higher infected and exposed populations and/or large inflows to Minnesota, such as Arkansas, Tennessee, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Alabama. This approach minimizes the importation of infectious individuals during the critical initial weeks when Minnesota's susceptible population is large and infection risk is high, thus reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. States with relatively stable or lower infection prevalence, like Arizona and Texas, receive more balanced (even) distributions to maintain economic activity while still controlling epidemic risk. The total inbound flow per state remains constant, but weekly fractions are adjusted to front-load restrictions, effectively flattening the curve of imported infections. This cooperative balancing ensures that no single state's traffic control disproportionately harms mobility while collectively reducing epidemic pressure. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early restrictions become even more critical to prevent case surges. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or control measures improve, gradual relaxation can be accelerated. This dynamic approach is adaptive, targeting resources to weeks and states with the greatest infection pressure and mobility risk, thereby optimizing public health outcomes while preserving essential travel and commerce. The exact sum of fractions to 1 for each state guarantees that total traffic volumes remain consistent with ground truth, ensuring feasibility and fairness in policy implementation."

This approach minimizes the importation of infectious individuals during the critical initial weeks when Minnesota's susceptible population is large and infection risk is high, thus reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. States with relatively stable or lower infection prevalence, like Arizona and Texas, receive more balanced (even) distributions to maintain economic activity while still controlling epidemic risk. The total inbound flow per state remains constant, but weekly fractions are adjusted to front-load restrictions, effectively flattening the curve of imported infections. This cooperative balancing ensures that no single state's traffic control disproportionately harms mobility while collectively reducing epidemic pressure. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early restrictions become even more critical to prevent case surges. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or control measures improve, gradual relaxation can be accelerated. This dynamic approach is adaptive, targeting resources to weeks and states with the greatest infection pressure and mobility risk, thereby optimizing public health outcomes while preserving essential travel and commerce.

The average inbound flow is low (2196.75 daily). An even distribution pattern is chosen to maintain steady mobility while controlling risk evenly, given no strong increasing or decreasing trend in Alabama's infection rates.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies for Minnesota prioritize minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases through strategic weekly inbound flow allocations from each origin state. Origin states with higher infection prevalence (I relative to S) and higher inbound flows are allocated stricter controls in earlier weeks (strict-first pattern) to curb early importations, while states with lower infection pressure or improving conditions receive relaxed-first or even patterns to balance mobility and control. This approach reduces the peak importation risk in any single week, smoothing the inflow of potentially infected travelers and allowing Minnesota's healthcare capacity to manage cases effectively. Quantitatively, the expected imported infected cases from each state scale with the product of inbound flow, weekly fraction, and infection prevalence (I/S). By adjusting weekly fractions such that their sum remains exactly one, we preserve total inbound traffic levels while redistributing the timing of arrivals to minimize epidemic impact. Cross-state cooperation logic entails prioritizing stricter early controls for states with higher infection pressure and large flows (e.g., Wisconsin, Arkansas, Tennessee), while states with lower risk or stable conditions maintain more even or relaxed distributions. Sensitivity analysis reveals that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls would become more critical to prevent outbreak spikes. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta is lower, more relaxed or even distributions could be employed to support economic activity. Overall, this balanced, data-driven allocation strategy effectively reduces the risk of imported infections and subsequent deaths, while maintaining essential mobility and economic functions."

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic control policies across all origin states are designed to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Minnesota by strategically modulating the timing and intensity of travel restrictions.

Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or large susceptible populations (e.g., Nebraska, Indiana, Texas) use even patterns to balance epidemic control with mobility needs, avoiding excessive restrictions that could impair economic and social activities.\n\nThis coordinated strategy leverages quantitative cooperation logic: by collectively suppressing early imported cases from high-risk states through stricter early-week controls and allowing more relaxed measures later as local epidemic conditions stabilize, the approach flattens potential infection surges. The total inbound flow from each origin state remains constant, preserving essential mobility and economic connections, while the temporal redistribution minimizes risk.\n\nSensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases in any origin state, stricter early-week controls would become even more critical to prevent seeding in Minnesota. Conversely, improvements in local control or vaccination in origin states could allow more relaxed patterns without compromising safety. The flexibility of the weekly fractions enables dynamic adjustments in response to evolving epidemic trends, ensuring robust and adaptive epidemic control balanced with mobility preservation."

The infection prevalence is low but non-negligible. Given the inbound flow to Minnesota (2579.18 daily), imported infections are roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/Population). To minimize risk, stricter controls are applied in earlier weeks (strict-first pattern) to reduce initial imported cases and delay potential secondary spread. This balances epidemic control by front-loading restrictions while allowing gradual relaxation to preserve mobility. The fractions sum precisely to 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations collectively aim to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Minnesota by strategically modulating weekly traffic fractions based on each origin state's infection prevalence and daily inbound flows. States with higher infection prevalence (high I and E relative to S), such as Idaho, Utah, Wisconsin, Arkansas, and Michigan, receive stricter controls especially in early weeks to reduce initial imported infections when Minnesota's epidemic burden is vulnerable. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence and smaller flows are allowed more relaxed traffic early but with cautious tightening mid-to-late period. Balancing epidemic control and mobility, the patterns (strict-first or relaxed-first) reflect infection pressure trends: strict-first to blunt initial importation surges, relaxed-first to spread risk over time when prevalence or flow varies. Quantitatively, imported infections approximately scale as Flow*ft*(I/Population), so reducing ft in weeks with higher risk reduces overall importation risk. By ensuring all 4 weekly fractions sum to exactly 1, the total inbound flow remains constant, preserving essential mobility and economic activity. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter first-week controls become even more critical to prevent large outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence declines or beta is suppressed by vaccination or NPIs, more relaxed allocations can be safely adopted. Inter-state cooperation via coordinated timing of restrictions prevents shifting risk from one origin to another, smoothing imported infection waves and reducing Minnesota's epidemic peaks and deaths. This strategy leverages temporal and spatial heterogeneity in epidemic dynamics and mobility to optimize public health outcomes while sustaining essential travel and commerce."

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy adopts strict-first traffic control patterns for origin states with higher infection prevalence (e.g., Arkansas, Idaho, South Carolina) to limit early imported infections, reducing the epidemic burden on Minnesota. States with moderate infection prevalence follow a mild strict-first approach, balancing epidemic control and economic mobility by frontloading restrictions then gradually relaxing them. Low-prevalence states or those with stable infection levels and very high flows (Iowa, Nebraska, Wisconsin) are assigned even traffic fraction patterns to avoid unnecessary disruption and maintain steady economic activity. This coordinated allocation minimizes cumulative imported infections by reducing risk when infection pressure is highest, especially early in the 4-week period when imported cases can seed outbreaks. The approach balances epidemic control and mobility by gradually relaxing restrictions as infection pressure subsides or control measures take effect. Quantitatively, the imported infections from each origin state are approximated by Flow*ft*(I/S), and balancing ft over weeks ensures total flow remains constant while minimizing high-risk importation periods. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence increases or transmission rate beta rises, stricter early restrictions should be intensified to prevent importation surges. Conversely, if prevalence declines or transmission reduces, mobility restrictions can be relaxed more evenly.

States with moderate infection prevalence follow a mild strict-first approach, balancing epidemic control and economic mobility by frontloading restrictions then gradually relaxing them. Low-prevalence states or those with stable infection levels and very high flows (Iowa, Nebraska, Wisconsin) are assigned even traffic fraction patterns to avoid unnecessary disruption and maintain steady economic activity. This coordinated allocation minimizes cumulative imported infections by reducing risk when infection pressure is highest, especially early in the 4-week period when imported cases can seed outbreaks. The approach balances epidemic control and mobility by gradually relaxing restrictions as infection pressure subsides or control measures take effect. Quantitatively, the imported infections from each origin state are approximated by Flow*ft*(I/S), and balancing ft over weeks ensures total flow remains constant while minimizing high-risk importation periods. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence increases or transmission rate beta rises, stricter early restrictions should be intensified to prevent importation surges. Conversely, if prevalence declines or transmission reduces, mobility restrictions can be relaxed more evenly. This adaptive, data-driven allocation supports epidemic control in Minnesota while maintaining sustainable mobility across origin states.'

States with high infection prevalence and high flow volumes, such as Michigan, Texas, Arkansas, and Tennessee, receive strict-first patterns imposing stronger restrictions early to prevent large importation spikes that could overwhelm Minnesota's healthcare resources. States with moderate infection levels and stable trends, like Arizona, Iowa, and Mississippi, adopt even traffic fractions to maintain balanced mobility while controlling importation risks. For states with lower prevalence but high flow, such as Wisconsin, a relaxed-first pattern allows Minnesota to leverage internal epidemic control and avoid overly restrictive measures that might be unsustainable or economically damaging. This cross-state cooperation ensures that the total imported infectious pressure is spread over time, reducing peak importation risks and allowing Minnesota to react and adapt. The quantitative logic considers that imported infected individuals scale roughly with Flow*ft*(I/population), so adjusting ft weekly modulates the importation risk while keeping total flow constant. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission parameters like beta were to rise, stricter front-loading of restrictions would be even more beneficial. Conversely, if prevalence declines or vaccination rates increase, gradual relaxation could be expedited. This policy framework carefully balances epidemic control with essential mobility, aiming to minimize health impacts without unnecessarily hindering economic and social activities. All fractions are validated to sum exactly to 1, ensuring total inbound flows remain consistent with ground truth volumes."

    "notes": "Alabama has a moderate number of infected individuals (I=424) relative to its large susceptible population (S=4,857,037). The risk of imported infections is proportional to the product of the flow fraction and the infected fraction: imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)). Given the moderate infection pressure, a strict-first pattern is chosen to reduce early-week inflow, allowing for more control when prevalence is higher, then gradually relaxing restrictions as monitoring improves. This balances epidemic control by minimizing early imported infections and mobility by easing restrictions later. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000."

Using the formula imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), early weeks require stricter control to minimize initial importation of cases. A strict-first pattern is used, with initially low flow fractions that increase slightly later. This approach helps reduce the number of imported infections and thus disease spread in Minnesota.

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce imported infections and deaths in Minnesota, inbound traffic allocations follow patterns sensitive to each origin state's infection pressure measured by infected and exposed individuals relative to their populations. States with higher infection prevalence are assigned stricter early-week controls (strict-first pattern) to reduce initial importation risk, allowing Minnesota's healthcare system to adapt and reduce transmission chains. States with more stable or moderate infection levels adopt even or relaxed-first patterns to balance epidemic control with economic mobility and social needs. The total inbound flow from each state remains constant to honor existing mobility commitments, but weeks with higher infection risks have reduced fractions to minimize imported infections. This distribution leverages temporal balancing: lowering flow when infection pressure is high and increasing it when risk is lower. Sensitivity considerations include changes in prevalence or transmission rates (beta). If prevalence rises in a state, stricter early-week controls become more critical. Conversely, if transmission rates decrease due to interventions, relaxed patterns may be more appropriate. This coordinated, adaptive approach across states and weeks reduces overall imported infections, cumulative confirmed cases, and deaths in Minnesota, while respecting mobility baselines to sustain essential mobility and economic functions."

The risk of importing infection into Minnesota is proportional to the inbound flow times the fraction of infectious individuals in Alabama's population. Given the moderately stable infection levels, a 'strict-first' pattern is chosen to reduce inbound traffic initially, thus minimizing early imported infections and allowing Minnesota's epidemic control measures to be more effective. This reduces the initial importation pressure and shifts more traffic to later weeks when Minnesota's local infection levels may be better controlled. The trade-off involves slightly reduced mobility in the first two weeks but increased mobility later to maintain total flow. The fractions sum to 1 exactly (0.30+0.25+0.25+0.20=1.00)."

The infection pressure (I/S) is approximately 8.75e-5, which is low, indicating a moderate risk of imported infections. The expected imported infected cases roughly scale as Flow * ft * (I/S). Given the moderate risk and the need to maintain mobility, an even distribution pattern is chosen. This means the inbound flow is evenly split across the four weeks to avoid sudden surges or drops that could destabilize local epidemic control. This even pattern balances epidemic control and economic mobility, minimizing peaks in imported infections while preserving steady inbound traffic. The fractions sum exactly to 1 as required."

Given this elevated infection prevalence, a strict-first pattern is adopted: stricter traffic control in early weeks (lower fractions) and gradually relaxed control later. This approach reduces early imported infections when local susceptibility is still high and allows for some recovery and monitoring before increasing flow. The fractions sum to 1 exactly, and this front-loaded control reduces cumulative imported infections while allowing mobility later when the epidemic may be better managed."

Due to this relatively higher risk, a strict-first pattern is chosen with more control in the first week (0.15) and relaxed gradually.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic control policy for Minnesota strategically balances epidemic control and mobility by adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions from each origin state while keeping total inbound flow constant over 4 weeks. States with higher infection pressure (higher ratios of infected and exposed individuals to susceptible population) such as Michigan, Ohio, Texas, Wisconsin, and Arizona are assigned stricter traffic control in the early weeks (lower fractions in week 1 and 2) to minimize early importation of infections into Minnesota. This front-loaded control reduces the initial seeding of cases and consequently lowers cumulative confirmed and deceased cases locally. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure or relatively better epidemic control are allowed a more even or relaxed-first pattern, enabling smoother or slightly front-loaded mobility to mitigate economic and social disruption. Across all origin states, the fractions sum precisely to 1, ensuring the total inbound flow remains unchanged, thus preserving expected economic activity while redistributing risk temporally. This temporal redistribution of traffic allows Minnesotas healthcare and epidemic response systems to better absorb and control imported infections. The cooperation logic leverages both spatial and temporal risk balancing: spatially by modulating flows from higher-risk origins more strictly early on, and temporally by gradually relaxing controls to allow economic recovery. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence increases in any origin state, stricter early controls should be intensified, especially in weeks 1 and 2, to prevent exponential growth of imported cases. Similarly, variations in transmission rates (beta) within Minnesota would affect how quickly imported cases generate local outbreaks, informing the tightness of early restrictions. Overall, this policy is designed as a dynamic and adaptive framework that optimizes between minimizing epidemic spread and maximizing essential mobility, matched precisely to states current epidemic status and expected risk profiles."

Across all origin states, the fractions sum precisely to 1, ensuring the total inbound flow remains unchanged, thus preserving expected economic activity while redistributing risk temporally. This temporal redistribution of traffic allows Minnesotas healthcare and epidemic response systems to better absorb and control imported infections. The cooperation logic leverages both spatial and temporal risk balancing: spatially by modulating flows from higher-risk origins more strictly early on, and temporally by gradually relaxing controls to allow economic recovery. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence increases in any origin state, stricter early controls should be intensified, especially in weeks 1 and 2, to prevent exponential growth of imported cases. Similarly, variations in transmission rates (beta) within Minnesota would affect how quickly imported cases generate local outbreaks, informing the tightness of early restrictions. Overall, this policy is designed as a dynamic and adaptive framework that optimizes between minimizing epidemic spread and maximizing essential mobility, matched precisely to states current epidemic status and expected risk profiles.'

The infected proportion is relatively low but not negligible. The inbound flow to Minnesota from Alabama is 2196.75 daily on average. Imported infections can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/population), implying higher flow fractions in weeks with lower infection prevalence are riskier. Given Alabama's stable infection numbers but non-negligible infected count, a 'strict-first' pattern is chosen to reduce early-week imports when Minnesota's local epidemic is still sensitive to new cases.

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy for Minnesota's inbound traffic control focuses on minimizing imported infections in the early weeks when the local epidemic is most vulnerable, then gradually relaxing restrictions to balance epidemic control and mobility needs. Origin states with higher infection prevalence (high I and E relative to population) such as Utah, Michigan, Arizona, Texas, and Wisconsin receive stricter early controls to reduce the risk of seeding new infections. States with lower infection prevalence have moderately strict early controls but still follow a strict-first pattern to protect Minnesota's epidemic curve. The total inbound flows per origin state remain constant, ensuring no overall reduction in mobility volume but redistributing it over four weeks to minimize peak importation risks. This cooperation logic balances risk across states and time, smoothing the importation pressure and allowing Minnesota to better manage its epidemic. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, the strictness in early weeks should be intensified accordingly, possibly shifting more flow to later weeks or reducing fractions in the first two weeks further. Conversely, if local control improves or prevalence decreases, a more relaxed-first pattern could be considered to support economic recovery. This policy is robust to moderate changes in parameters and prioritizes reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Minnesota by preventing early epidemic seeding from external sources."

The risk of importing infections depends on the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population). Given the declining infection pressure, a strict-first pattern is chosen, allocating lower fractions in earlier weeks to reduce initial imported infections and gradually relaxing control. Trade-offs involve balancing economic and social mobility with disease control, especially as Alabama's inflow is moderate (2227.6 daily). The fractions sum to exactly 1, ensuring consistent total flow allocation."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively minimize expected imported infections and deaths in Minnesota, the allocation strategy balances the infection prevalence and mobility needs across origin states and weeks. States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to their susceptible populations (e.g., Arkansas, Tennessee, Idaho) adopt a strict-first pattern, concentrating stricter traffic controls in the initial weeks to reduce early importation risk when infections are higher. This front-loaded control helps blunt the initial surge of imported cases, mitigating cumulative epidemic growth within Minnesota. Conversely, states with stable or lower infection pressure and large susceptible populations (e.g., Arizona, Texas, Nebraska, Wisconsin) distribute traffic evenly across weeks, maintaining steady flow to support economic and social activities while managing risk. States exhibiting rising or fluctuating infection trends (e.g., Iowa, Utah) use a relaxed-first or mixed pattern, allowing more flow early when risk is lower and tightening mid-period to prevent potential spikes. This temporal balancing across weeks leverages the incubation and infectious periods to flatten imported infection peaks. Quantitatively, the imported infection risk for each origin state is proportional to the product of daily inflow, weekly fraction ft, and the infected proportion (I/population). By adjusting ft, the policy reduces peak imported infections, thus lowering secondary transmissions and deaths in Minnesota. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls or longer strict periods may be warranted, while reductions in these parameters allow more relaxed policies. Additionally, cross-state cooperation is critical; states with higher infection burdens take on stricter controls to compensate, enabling states with lower burdens to maintain mobility. This cooperative approach optimizes the overall epidemic outcome and economic activity for Minnesota."

The imported infections roughly scale as Flow * fraction * (I / Population), so spreading inbound traffic evenly limits sudden spikes in imported infections. The infection pressure does not show strong increasing or decreasing trends, so an even pattern balances disease control and mobility fairly. Lowering any particular week excessively risks economic and social disruption, while equal distribution maintains flow and mitigates risk. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic allocation strategy aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Minnesota by strategically balancing epidemic risk and mobility needs across all origin states over the next 4 weeks. States with high infection prevalence and/or large inflow volumes (e.g., Wisconsin, Arizona, Iowa, Utah) are assigned strict-first traffic patterns, reducing inbound flow fractions in the initial weeks to curb early importation of infections. This front-loaded control reduces the seeding of cases in Minnesota when epidemic risk is highest, thereby lowering onward transmission and deaths. States with moderate or stable infection levels and moderate flows (e.g., Alabama, Indiana, Virginia, New Mexico) receive even distributions of inbound flow, balancing epidemic control and economic/social mobility without abrupt disruptions. Lower risk states with smaller flow or infection counts have mild strict-first patterns, allowing some early control but maintaining reasonable mobility. All fractions per state sum exactly to 1, preserving total inbound flow and avoiding unintended surges or deficits. This coordinated approach leverages quantitative cooperation logic: early strict control in high-risk states reduces overall imported infection pressure, enabling relaxation in later weeks and in lower-risk states to sustain economic activity and public compliance. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission beta increases, the strict-first pattern's importance amplifies, necessitating even tighter early controls. Conversely, if prevalence declines or vaccination coverage increases, traffic fractions could be more evenly balanced to enhance mobility. This flexible framework optimally allocates inbound traffic temporally and spatially, mitigating epidemic impact in Minnesota while respecting mobility and economic imperatives."

The high daily average inbound flow (~1929) suggests a substantial potential importation of infections calculated approximately by Flow*ft*(I/population). To minimize risk, a strict-first pattern is chosen, allocating lower fractions in the initial weeks when cases could surge due to imported infections. The later weeks have relaxed flow to balance mobility needs. The trade-off acknowledges the economic and social importance of maintaining some traffic but prioritizes early strict control to reduce cumulative cases and deaths in Minnesota.
