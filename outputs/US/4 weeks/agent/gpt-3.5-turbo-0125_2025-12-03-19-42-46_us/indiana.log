  "global_guidance": "The overall traffic control policy across all origin states aims to minimize imported infections into Indiana by adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions while keeping total 4-week inflow constant. States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to susceptible populations generally receive stricter control earlier (strict-first pattern) to reduce early importation risk, which is critical to preventing local outbreaks. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure or large populations but lower infection prevalence often have even or relaxed-first patterns to balance mobility and epidemic control, allowing some travel early but tightening restrictions later as the situation evolves. This cooperative approach balances epidemic risks from multiple inflow sources, preventing simultaneous peaks in imported infections that could overwhelm local health resources. The quantitative logic relies on the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / total population), ensuring that adjusting ft impacts infection importation proportionally. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls should be intensified, especially from high-risk states, to mitigate exponential growth. Conversely, if infection levels decline or vaccination rates improve, controls can be relaxed progressively. The strategy also balances economic and social mobility needs by avoiding overly restrictive policies that could disrupt travel and commerce, instead distributing controls temporally and spatially.

States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to susceptible populations generally receive stricter control earlier (strict-first pattern) to reduce early importation risk, which is critical to preventing local outbreaks. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure or large populations but lower infection prevalence often have even or relaxed-first patterns to balance mobility and epidemic control, allowing some travel early but tightening restrictions later as the situation evolves. This cooperative approach balances epidemic risks from multiple inflow sources, preventing simultaneous peaks in imported infections that could overwhelm local health resources. The quantitative logic relies on the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / total population), ensuring that adjusting ft impacts infection importation proportionally. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls should be intensified, especially from high-risk states, to mitigate exponential growth. Conversely, if infection levels decline or vaccination rates improve, controls can be relaxed progressively. The strategy also balances economic and social mobility needs by avoiding overly restrictive policies that could disrupt travel and commerce, instead distributing controls temporally and spatially. All fraction allocations sum exactly to 1 per state, preserving total inbound flow, ensuring compliance with policy constraints and practical implementation feasibility.'

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocations collectively aim to minimize imported infections and subsequent confirmed and deceased cases in Indiana by adjusting weekly fractions while keeping total flow constant per origin state. The strategy prioritizes early-week control ('strict-first' pattern) for states with higher infected and exposed populations (e.g., Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee) to reduce early importation of infectious individuals, which can seed new outbreaks in Indiana. For states with relatively stable or lower infection pressures (e.g., Alabama, Idaho, Nebraska), even distributions are recommended to maintain balanced economic activity without risking spikes in importation. Relaxed-first or mixed patterns are applied sparingly for states with stable but moderate infection pressures to allow some early mobility while tightening controls later, balancing risk and economic needs. Quantitatively, imported infected individuals are approximated by the product of inbound flow, fraction allocation per week, and the proportion of infected individuals in the origin state's population (I/population). By distributing traffic to lower infection pressure weeks, the policy reduces the likelihood of epidemic growth in Indiana. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls would be needed to maintain low importation risk. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, fractions can be relaxed more evenly to support mobility. Coordination across states ensures that total inbound infections are minimized by not allowing high-risk states to concentrate flow in any single week, thus preventing surges. This policy balances epidemic control and mobility, aiming to sustain economic and social activity while protecting public health."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic control policies collectively aim to minimize imported infections into Indiana by prioritizing stricter control in the earliest weeks (strict-first pattern) for states with high infected and exposed prevalence and high inflows, while adopting even flow distributions for states with lower risk or smaller inflows. This strategy reduces the initial infection pressure on Indiana's population, leveraging the epidemic model parameters (beta, alpha, gamma, mu, delta) that indicate transmission risk is highest when infected individuals enter susceptible populations. By concentrating restrictions early, the cumulative number of imported infected cases, which scale as imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), is minimized when the epidemic is most sensitive to additional cases, thus lowering overall confirmed and deceased cases. Quantitatively, balancing inflow fractions across weeks ensures total inbound flow remains constant per origin state, satisfying constraints while enabling temporal risk management. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early restrictions would further reduce cases, whereas lower prevalence supports more relaxed distributions. Similarly, if beta (transmission rate) decreases, even more relaxed patterns could be considered. This cooperative, cross-state approach optimizes risk reduction by targeting states with higher infectious pressure and inflow volumes with stricter early controls, while maintaining mobility from lower-risk origins to sustain economic and social activity. The sum of fractions for each origin state is exactly 1, ensuring consistent total inbound flow while strategically shifting weekly proportions to achieve epidemic control objectives."

The imported infections can be estimated as Flow*ft*(I/population), suggesting that with a moderate infection prevalence, even distribution of traffic is reasonable. The infection pressure is stable without significant upward or downward trends in Alabama's SEIQRD states. Thus, an even pattern is chosen because it balances mobility and control without risking sudden spikes in cases. The sum of fractions equals exactly 1, ensuring total flow consistency. This approach minimizes disruptions while maintaining disease control."

A relaxed-first pattern is adopted, allowing lower restrictions in later weeks (weeks 3 and 4) as infection rates may stabilize or decline, and stricter controls initially to curb early importation. This balances epidemic control by front-loading restrictions to reduce early importation and gradually restoring mobility. Fractions sum to exactly 1."

States with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflow volumes, such as Idaho, Nebraska, and New Mexico, have even traffic allocations to maintain economic and social mobility while keeping epidemic risk manageable. The quantitative cooperation logic is based on the formula imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), balancing infection risk across states and weeks. By allocating stricter controls in early weeks for higher-risk states and relaxing controls in later weeks, the policy flattens the infection importation curve, reducing peak epidemic pressure on Indiana's healthcare system. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence (I/population) increases or the transmission rate beta rises, stricter or longer early restrictions would be needed to maintain control. Conversely, if prevalence or beta decreases, traffic fractions can be more evenly distributed or relaxed earlier. This adaptive, multi-state coordinated traffic control strategy optimizes epidemic control and mobility, effectively reducing expected imported infections and deaths in Indiana over the next four weeks."

The imported infected can be approximated as inflow*fraction*(I/total population), so to reduce risk we allocate lower fractions in later weeks to slow cumulative imported infections. We choose a relaxed-first pattern with higher fractions in the initial weeks (0.3, 0.3) and stricter control later (0.2, 0.2) to balance mobility needs early and epidemic control as risks accumulate. This approach allows some mobility initially but tightens to prevent surge importations. The fractions sum to exactly 1 (0.3+0.3+0.2+0.2=1) ensuring total flow is conserved."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively adjusting inbound traffic fractions across origin states aims to minimize cumulative imported infections into Indiana, thereby reducing subsequent confirmed and deceased cases. States with high infected and exposed numbers combined with high inflow (e.g., Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio) are prioritized for stricter early week controls to delay and reduce importation risk during periods when Indiana's local epidemic remains sensitive. Conversely, states with moderately lower prevalence or inflow have more evenly distributed or relaxed-first patterns to maintain economic activity while controlling risk. This cross-state strategy balances risk by temporally redistributing flows: stricter early controls reduce initial pressure, while later relaxations accommodate mobility without increasing overall imported case load, since total 4-week inflow remains constant per state. Quantitatively, expected imported infected scale with inflow*fractions*(I/population), so lowering fractions when prevalence is high reduces instantaneous risk. Sensitivity analysis suggests if prevalence or transmissibility (beta) increases, stricter early controls may be needed to avoid surges; if these parameters decrease, more relaxed or even patterns suffice. This dynamic approach integrates epidemiological data and mobility baselines, optimizing traffic allocations to minimize epidemic impact while considering economic and social trade-offs. The exact sum of fractions to 1 per state ensures total inbound flow remains as ground truth, preserving mobility volume but improving temporal distribution to mitigate transmission risk effectively."

    "notes": "Alabama's past 28-day averages show a small exposed (E=2398) and infected (I=742) population relative to its large susceptible population (S=4,814,658). Given the high inbound flow to Indiana (16,619 daily average), the expected imported infections scale approximately as Flow*ft*(I/Population). Alabama's infection prevalence is low, but the sheer volume of travelers poses a risk. A strict-first pattern is chosen to frontload strict controls in the initial weeks (fractions 0.30, 0.25), gradually relaxing controls later to balance mobility. This approach minimizes early imported infections when Indiana's own infection count is substantial (I=6061), reducing transmission amplification. Trade-offs include temporary mobility restrictions for Alabama travelers balanced against infection control benefits. Sum of fractions is exactly 1, ensuring flow conservation."

The inbound flow to Indiana is 10,555 daily, moderate but significant. Imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/Population), so early strict control reduces initial infection seeding. The 'strict-first' allocation is used, with higher restrictions in week 1 (0.35) and gradually relaxing control. This pattern limits early introduction of infection, considering Indiana's still high current infections. Mobility is slightly constrained early, but relaxes later to facilitate economic and social activities. Fractions sum to 1 exactly."

The infection prevalence is higher relative to population. However, the flow is lower compared to larger states. An even distribution (0.25 each week) is selected to balance epidemic control and mobility, avoiding too strict controls that could disrupt travel patterns. This approach assumes that Arkansas's infection pressure is steady and that Indiana's own epidemic dynamics require balanced inflow management.

Given Idaho's relatively high infection prevalence and low flow, a relaxed-first pattern is used, with stricter control in the later weeks (fractions increasing from 0.20 to 0.30).

  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic control policy across origin states prioritizes reducing early imported infections by allocating stricter controls in the first two weeks for states with high infected populations and/or high inbound flows, such as Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama, following a strict-first pattern. This frontloading minimizes seeding during Indiana's vulnerable phase when its own infection prevalence is significant. For states with lower infected prevalence but significant exposed populations or moderate flow, an even or relaxed-first pattern balances mobility and epidemic control, preventing excessive disruption while mitigating risk. The allocation ensures constant total inbound flows per origin over 4 weeks, preserving mobility baselines while redistributing weekly flows to optimize disease control. The risk of imported infections is approximated as Flow * ft * (I / Population), guiding fraction adjustments. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence increases or the transmission rate beta rises, stricter early controls become more critical, potentially requiring more frontloaded strictness or extending high restrictions into week 3. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta declines, a more relaxed approach with even distributions may be sufficient. Coordinated control across states prevents shifting risk temporally or geographically, balancing traffic to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Indiana efficiently. The approach acknowledges trade-offs between epidemic control and mobility, aiming to minimize overall health impact while maintaining essential travel flows."

  "global_guidance": "Across all origin states, the recommended traffic control policies aim to balance epidemic control with economic mobility by adjusting inbound traffic fractions over four weeks while maintaining total flow constant. States with higher infection prevalence or larger infected counts relative to their population, and those with high flow volumes into Indiana, are assigned a relaxed-first pattern, where early weeks have lower fractions (stricter controls) and later weeks have higher fractions (relaxed controls) to mitigate importation risk upfront and allow gradual normalization. Conversely, some states with very high infection prevalence but smaller flow volumes (e.g., Utah, Idaho) are assigned even patterns to evenly distribute controls and avoid abrupt disruptions. The formula for expected imported infections is roughly proportional to Flow * fraction * (I / Population), guiding stricter controls on weeks with higher expected risk. The trade-off involves reducing early importation of infections to slow epidemic growth in Indiana, while not overly restricting mobility which affects economic and social activities. Collectively, this staggered approach across states and weeks reduces the cumulative imported infections and deaths by frontloading restrictions on high-risk origins and weeks, while allowing relaxed controls later when risk diminishes or local mitigation improves. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls would be needed, whereas lower prevalence supports more relaxed policies. The approach also adapts to flow volumes to ensure risk proportionality. All fractions are validated to sum exactly to 1.000 for each state, ensuring total inbound flow consistency as required."

The imported infection risk can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)). Given the relatively stable infection prevalence, an even distribution of traffic control across the 4 weeks is appropriate. This pattern balances epidemic control and mobility by not overly restricting movement in any single week, minimizing social disruption while controlling imported risk. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.25*4=1)."

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy to allocate inbound traffic fractions across origin states and weeks is to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Indiana by controlling the timing and volume of potentially infected arrivals. States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to their total populations, especially those with high inbound flows to Indiana, are assigned stricter controls early on (strict-first pattern). This approach minimizes the immediate importation of infections, reducing the seeding potential and subsequent local transmission in Indiana. For states with moderate infection prevalence and lower inbound flows, more balanced or even traffic control patterns are applied, allowing sustained mobility while managing risk. The cumulative inbound flow from each origin remains constant over the 4 weeks to maintain economic activity and travel needs, but shifting weekly fractions controls the timing of arrival risks. This temporal balancing distributes risk, preventing overwhelming infection surges. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence (I or E) increases in any state, stricter early controls should be intensified for that state to prevent importation spikes. Conversely, if beta (transmission rate) decreases due to interventions, controls can be more relaxed. The chosen allocation patterns reflect this adaptive control, balancing public health protection and economic mobility. The fractions for all states sum precisely to 1 over 4 weeks, ensuring consistent total inflow. This coordinated approach across states and weeks optimizes risk reduction for Indiana's epidemic control."

The risk of importing infections is proportional to the inbound flow multiplied by the fraction and the infection prevalence (I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)). Given Alabama's steady infection level without a recent surge or decline, an even traffic allocation pattern is appropriate. This approach balances epidemic control and mobility, maintaining consistent flow to avoid abrupt economic impacts while still mitigating risk.

By adjusting weekly fractions while keeping total four-week inflow constant, the strategy balances epidemic control and mobility. States with higher infection and exposure levels, such as South Carolina, Michigan, and Arkansas, adopt stricter early restrictions (strict-first or relaxed-first patterns with lower fractions in early weeks) to curb initial importation risk. Conversely, states with stable or lower infection prevalence use even or relaxed-first patterns to maintain economic activity without significantly elevating risk. Quantitatively, imported infections are proportional to Flow*ft*(I/total_population), so reducing ft in weeks with higher infection pressure reduces cumulative risk. This cooperation across states distributes infection risk over time, avoiding surges that could overwhelm Indiana's healthcare. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become more critical, while lower prevalence allows more relaxed policies. The chosen patterns and fractions carefully consider these dynamics, ensuring all fractions sum to exactly 1 per state to maintain consistent total inflow, thus preserving economic and logistical stability while prioritizing public health."

The daily inbound flow to Indiana is 24680, a significant mobility volume. The expected imported infections per week can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population), indicating that controlling flow in early weeks can reduce importation. The current infections are relatively low compared to other states, and no sharp increasing or decreasing trend is indicated, so an even pattern allocation is chosen for fairness and to balance mobility and control. This approach minimizes disruption while keeping infection importation steady. The sum of the fractions is exactly 1.0000."

The imported infections scale with Flow * ft * (I/population). Arizona's infected numbers are somewhat stable; however, since the exposed count is substantial, indicating potential future infectious increases, a relaxed-first pattern is chosen: increasing flow fractions in weeks 3 and 4 to allow more mobility as cases may stabilize or decline. Early weeks have stricter control to limit importation from possible incubation cases. This balances epidemic control and economic activity. The fractions sum to 1.000."

The inbound flow to Indiana is 6241 daily. Given the substantial infectious and exposed population, we apply a strict-first pattern with lower fractions in later weeks to minimize early importation risk. Early weeks have more stringent control (lower ft) to prevent seeding infections in Indiana, gradually relaxing later as the local epidemic may stabilize. This approach reduces cumulative cases and deaths while allowing some mobility in later weeks. The fractions sum exactly to 1."

  "global_guidance": "The overall objective is to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Indiana by optimizing the weekly inbound flow fractions from each origin state while keeping the total 4-week inbound flow constant. States with high infectious and exposed counts relative to population and high daily inbound flow to Indiana are prioritized for stricter controls in early weeks to reduce imported infections. This reduces the seeding of new cases in Indiana, cutting transmission chains early. For states with lower infection pressure or smaller flow, an even or relaxed-first pattern balances epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs. The relaxed-first pattern delays relaxation until later weeks, allowing initial suppression of imported cases. The strict-first pattern reduces flow early when infection risk is highest, relaxing later as conditions improve. The even pattern maintains steady control and mobility when risk is moderate and stable. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections scale with Flow * ft * (I/population), so lowering ft in weeks with higher infection prevalence or exposed cases reduces imported infections and downstream cases and deaths. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls (lower ft) become more critical to prevent exponential growth. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed policies can be applied without significant risk. Coordination across states ensures that the total imported infection pressure is minimized weekly, smoothing the epidemic curve in Indiana. Balancing epidemic control and mobility requires nuanced per-state and per-week adjustments rather than uniform policies. This approach optimizes public health outcomes and social-economic considerations."

The imported infected estimate roughly follows imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing flow early will reduce total imported infections. Given the current state, a strict-first pattern is optimal to sharply cut early imported infections, flattening downstream cases in Indiana. This also aligns with the moderate E=1356 and Q=12245 values indicating some ongoing exposure and confirmed cases.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies collectively emphasize front-loaded strictness (strict-first pattern) for most origin states with higher infection prevalence or higher inflow to Indiana, such as Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. This approach minimizes imported infections early, flattening epidemic growth in Indiana since imported infections contribute proportionally to local incidence. The imported infections can be approximated as sum over states of Flow_i * f_i(t) * (I_i/pop_i). By reducing f_i(t) in early weeks for high-risk states, we limit seeding events and reduce secondary transmission. Lower early flow fractions translate to stricter controls, which, although limiting mobility, prevent exponential growth of cases and deaths in Indiana. For states with lower infected counts or inflow, more even or mildly strict-first patterns balance epidemic control and economic considerations, allowing mobility without significant risk increases. The allocation ensures total 4-week flow per origin remains constant, preserving economic activity over time. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or beta increases, stricter early restrictions or longer strict periods would be warranted to suppress transmission. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta is reduced due to interventions, mobility can be relaxed earlier. The coordinated pattern across states prevents shifts of travel demand to less restricted periods or origins, maintaining control effectiveness. This cooperative balancing across states and weeks maximizes epidemic control while minimizing social and economic disruption. All fractions sum exactly to 1.000 per origin state, validating the allocations."

The imported infections can be approximated as sum over states of Flow_i * f_i(t) * (I_i/pop_i). By reducing f_i(t) in early weeks for high-risk states, we limit seeding events and reduce secondary transmission. Lower early flow fractions translate to stricter controls, which, although limiting mobility, prevent exponential growth of cases and deaths in Indiana. For states with lower infected counts or inflow, more even or mildly strict-first patterns balance epidemic control and economic considerations, allowing mobility without significant risk increases. The allocation ensures total 4-week flow per origin remains constant, preserving economic activity over time. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or beta increases, stricter early restrictions or longer strict periods would be warranted to suppress transmission. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta is reduced due to interventions, mobility can be relaxed earlier. The coordinated pattern across states prevents shifts of travel demand to less restricted periods or origins, maintaining control effectiveness. This cooperative balancing across states and weeks maximizes epidemic control while minimizing social and economic disruption. All fractions sum exactly to 1.000 per origin state, validating the allocations.'

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocations collectively aim to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Indiana by balancing infection risk and mobility needs across origin states and weeks. States with higher infection prevalence (I/S) and exposed populations receive stricter early controls to reduce imported infections when infection pressure is highest. Conversely, states with lower risk or stable infection trends have more relaxed or even traffic patterns, supporting economic activity. Quantitatively, the expected imported infected cases from each state scale with Flow*ft*(I/S), so adjusting ft over weeks allows dynamic control of infection importation without reducing total flow volume over 4 weeks. This intertemporal balancing reduces peak imported infections, smoothing epidemic pressure on Indiana's healthcare system. Cross-state coordination ensures that states with large flows and high infection prevalence (e.g., Ohio, Michigan) are managed more cautiously, while lower risk states have more relaxed patterns, optimizing overall risk. Sensitivity analyses show that if prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls would be needed to prevent surges, while lower beta allows more relaxed patterns. These allocations are designed to maintain economic mobility while controlling epidemic spread, validated by the fractions summing exactly to 1 for each origin state, ensuring total flow consistency and policy feasibility."

The expected imported infected cases roughly follow the formula: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / total_population). With a moderate but constant infection prevalence, a strict-first pattern is chosen to reduce early imported cases, lowering the initial weeks' traffic (f1=0.35, f2=0.30) and gradually relaxing controls. This balances epidemic control by front-loading restrictions when the infection risk is higher, while allowing some mobility later. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000, validating proper allocation."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocation adopts a mixed approach balancing strict-first, relaxed-first, and even traffic distribution patterns depending on each origin state's infection prevalence and risk profile. States with high infected and exposed counts relative to population, such as Michigan, Utah, and Idaho, often receive a relaxed-first pattern allowing some mobility early but tightening control in key weeks to reduce peak infection importation. States with lower but still significant infection risk, like Alabama and Mississippi, adopt a strict-first pattern prioritizing early restrictions to limit seeding infections in Indiana. For states with moderate or low infection prevalence but large travel volume, such as Kentucky, Ohio, and Texas, an even distribution is applied to smooth traffic control and avoid abrupt disruptions. The quantitative logic for imported infections estimates risk roughly proportional to the product of inbound flow, weekly traffic fraction, and the infected fraction of the origin population. By adjusting weekly fractions while maintaining the total inbound flow constant, the policy reduces cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by front-loading restrictions in weeks with higher infection pressure and relaxing later to support economic activity and mobility. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls become more critical to prevent overwhelming Indiana's healthcare system. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed traffic control can be tolerated. Cross-state coordination ensures that importation risk is balanced week-by-week, preventing simultaneous import surges from multiple states. This collective approach optimizes epidemic control in Indiana while minimizing social and economic disruption from mobility restrictions."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce expected imported infections and deaths in Indiana, the recommended inbound traffic allocations focus on stringent control in the initial weeks for states with higher infection pressure, reflected by higher infected and exposed counts relative to their susceptible populations. The imported infection risk from each origin state is roughly proportional to the product of the daily inbound flow, the fraction allocated to a given week, and the prevalence of infectious individuals (I/population) in that state. Applying stricter control (lower fractions) in the first two weeks for high-risk states minimizes early seeding of infections in Indiana, which is critical to prevent exponential growth and reduce cumulative cases and deaths. States with lower infection prevalence or larger susceptible populations have more evenly distributed fractions, balancing mobility and epidemic control without abrupt restrictions that could disrupt travel and economic activities. This inter-state coordination ensures that the total inflow remains constant over the 4 weeks but is temporally redistributed to minimize epidemic risk. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early control would be even more beneficial, whereas if prevalence decreases, allocations could be more relaxed. Delaying relaxation until later weeks allows Indiana's local interventions time to manage imported cases effectively. The allocations sum exactly to 1 for each origin state, preserving total inbound flow consistency and ensuring the feasibility of the recommended traffic control policies."

The exposed E=2853 and confirmed Q=27369 indicate ongoing transmission but not extreme. The imported infected cases can be approximated by Flow*ft*(I/population), where Flow is daily inflow and ft is the weekly fraction. To minimize imported infections, a balanced even distribution (even pattern) is adopted, spreading traffic evenly across the four weeks. This avoids sudden spikes in imported infections and allows epidemic control measures to remain stable. The trade-off is moderate mobility maintained while not overloading any single week with high risk. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.25+0.25+0.25+0.25)."

  "global_guidance": "The traffic control policy collectively balances epidemic risk across origin states by prioritizing stricter controls in early weeks for states with higher infection prevalence or large inflows, such as Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, and Michigan. This pattern reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths by minimizing early infection pressure when Indiana's susceptible population is still large. States with moderate or lower infection prevalence and smaller inflows, such as Alabama, Iowa, Minnesota, and South Carolina, employ even traffic patterns to maintain steady mobility without increased risk. Relaxed-first patterns are applied to states with moderate infection pressure to allow some early mobility but tighten controls as needed. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections scale with the product Flow*ft*(I/population), so shifting fractions ft towards weeks with lower infection pressure or cumulative immunity helps reduce overall risk. The approach balances mobility and epidemic control, avoiding sharp spikes that could overwhelm local healthcare. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls should be intensified, while if prevalence decreases, more relaxed patterns could be adopted. Coordinated allocation of traffic fractions across states and weeks reduces the total imported infection burden, protecting Indiana's population and minimizing deaths. This policy respects the constant total inflow constraint by adjusting only the weekly proportions (fractions) summing exactly to 1 per state. The design aims for sustainable epidemic control with feasible mobility allowances."

Relaxed-first patterns are applied to states with moderate infection pressure to allow some early mobility but tighten controls as needed. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections scale with the product Flow*ft*(I/population), so shifting fractions ft towards weeks with lower infection pressure or cumulative immunity helps reduce overall risk. The approach balances mobility and epidemic control, avoiding sharp spikes that could overwhelm local healthcare. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls should be intensified, while if prevalence decreases, more relaxed patterns could be adopted. Coordinated allocation of traffic fractions across states and weeks reduces the total imported infection burden, protecting Indiana's population and minimizing deaths. This policy respects the constant total inflow constraint by adjusting only the weekly proportions (fractions) summing exactly to 1 per state. The design aims for sustainable epidemic control with feasible mobility allowances."

The risk of imported infections roughly scales with Flow * ft * (I / total population). States with higher infection and exposure counts require stricter early control (strict-first pattern) to prevent seeding new outbreaks in Indiana, while states with lower prevalence can maintain even or relaxed-first patterns to balance mobility and control. This coordinated approach smooths the epidemic curve, avoiding spikes that could overwhelm Indiana's healthcare. By maintaining the total inbound flow constant per origin state over 4 weeks, the policy respects mobility needs while redistributing traffic temporally to reduce peak importation risk. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become more critical. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or immunity rises, traffic can be relaxed earlier. The allocations reflect quantitative cooperation logic: early strict controls in high-risk states reduce initial case seeding, while gradual relaxation in later weeks supports economic recovery. This balanced strategy minimizes imported cases and deaths while sustaining essential mobility."

The risk of imported infections can be roughly estimated as Flow*ft*(I / (S+E+I+Q+R+D)). Given that Alabama's infected proportion is moderate, a stricter control in the later weeks (f3 and f4 = 0.20 each) reduces cumulative imported infections when potential local outbreak amplification occurs. The first two weeks are allocated slightly higher fractions (0.30 each) to balance mobility needs and epidemic control, following a strict-last pattern to leverage potential improvements or local containment.

  "global_guidance": "The traffic control strategy across all origin states is designed to minimize cumulative imported infections and deaths in Indiana by balancing epidemic risk and economic mobility. States with high infection prevalence and high inbound flow (e.g., Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, South Carolina) receive stricter control early on (strict-first pattern), reducing the initial seeding risk of imported infections that could rapidly amplify locally. This front-loading of control is critical because early imported infections have a multiplicative effect on epidemic size due to exponential growth dynamics. States with moderate or stable infection pressure (e.g., Arizona, Minnesota, Texas, Virginia) adopt an even fractions pattern to maintain steady mobility with controlled risk. Low infection pressure states with moderate flows (e.g., Alabama, Iowa, Nebraska) often use strict-last patterns, allowing economic activity early and tightening later to prevent late-stage importations that could prolong the epidemic. Some states with intermediate risk use relaxed-mid patterns, gradually relaxing controls to optimize both epidemic control and mobility. The total daily inbound flow from each state is conserved by keeping fractions summing exactly to 1. This ensures no reduction in total traffic volume, only temporal redistribution. This temporal allocation helps flatten imported infection peaks, distributing risk over time and allowing local health systems to manage cases. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence increases in any origin state, stricter early controls (lower fractions in weeks 1 and 2) become more effective. Similarly, if transmission rate beta rises, front-loading restrictions further reduces cumulative cases. Conversely, if prevalence or beta fall, mobility can be more evenly distributed. This cooperative cross-state allocation balances the heterogeneous risk profiles and flows, reducing Indiana's overall epidemic burden while preserving essential mobility and economic function."

    "notes": "Alabama's population shows a relatively low number of infected individuals (I=420) compared to its susceptible population (S=4,870,651). The exposed (E=1,358) and confirmed (Q=13,142) numbers indicate some ongoing infection pressure, but the infected proportion relative to population is quite low (~0.0086%). The imported infected cases approximately scale as Flow * ft * (I / population), hence reducing flow in weeks with higher infection prevalence can reduce imported infections. However, Alabama's infection numbers are not sharply increasing or decreasing, supporting an even allocation pattern for inbound traffic to balance mobility and epidemic control. The fractions sum exactly to 1. This approach balances disease spread risks and economic/mobility needs, avoiding abrupt restrictions that could cause economic hardship, while maintaining moderate control throughout."

The infection prevalence is low (~0.0087%), but with substantial confirmed cases (Q=43,558). The inbound flow is moderate. To minimize infection importation, a strict-first pattern is chosen, placing the lowest fraction in week 3 (0.2) when infection pressure is presumed higher based on slight E and I numbers, and relatively higher fractions in weeks 1 and 4 to maintain some mobility. This pattern reduces imported infections during the peak risk period while allowing some relaxed mobility early and late. The fractions sum to exactly 1, ensuring total inbound flow is conserved."

This suggests heightened infection pressure on Indiana from Arkansas. The chosen pattern is relaxed-first, with relatively higher fractions in weeks 2 and 3 (0.3 each) and stricter control in weeks 1 and 4. This pattern is based on the assumption that infections may decline or be controlled over time, so moderate inbound traffic is allowed during weeks 2 and 3 when control measures might be less impactful or infections possibly lower, while stricter control is applied early and late to reduce importation risk. Fractions sum to 1 exactly."

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic control policy strategically balances epidemic control and mobility across all origin states to minimize importation of infections into Indiana. States with high infection prevalence and large inbound flows, such as Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee, are assigned stricter controls earlier or a strict-first pattern to reduce infection seeding in Indiana. States with moderate or low prevalence and lower flow generally have even traffic distributions to maintain mobility and economic activity. Relaxed-first patterns are applied where infection pressure is expected to decline or where a gradual reopening is preferred. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections are proportional to Flow * fraction * (I / population). By adjusting fractions over weeks, we redistribute inbound flow to lower-risk periods, reducing cumulative imported infections and deaths. This cooperation across states balances temporal infection risks and total flow constraints, ensuring total inbound traffic remains constant per origin but shifted to minimize epidemic impact. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls would yield greater benefits, while if prevalence decreases, more relaxed or even patterns could be considered to enhance mobility. The approach is robust to moderate fluctuations but should be revisited if epidemic dynamics change substantially. Overall, these fraction allocations optimize Indiana's risk management by temporally modulating inbound flows according to origin states' infection dynamics and mobility volumes."
