The imported infected cases roughly scale with Flow*ft*(I/S). Since the inflow is large (23287 daily average), even small relaxation could import many infections. The pattern chosen is strict-first, placing stricter controls in the earlier weeks (f1=0.30) to reduce immediate risk, then gradually relaxing. This aligns with the goal to suppress early importation of cases to reduce epidemic growth in Kentucky. Trade-offs involve some economic impact from early restrictions but prevent larger future outbreaks. The sum of fractions is exactly 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "The overall traffic control strategy for Kentucky focuses on minimizing imported infections and deaths by adjusting weekly inbound traffic fractions from all origin states, keeping total 4-week inflow constant per origin. States with higher infection prevalence (I and E) and higher inflow, such as Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee, South Carolina, and Alabama, have stricter controls in the initial weeks (strict-first pattern) to suppress early importation of cases which can seed outbreaks in Kentucky. This early suppression is critical given the exponential nature of epidemic growth. States with moderate or low infection prevalence and inflow utilize even or relaxed-first patterns to balance economic mobility and epidemic control, avoiding unnecessary severe restrictions while still managing risk. The quantitative logic is grounded on the proportionality of imported infected cases to the product of inflow, weekly fraction, and infection prevalence (I over population). Traffic allocation leverages temporal control: restricting flow when infection pressure is highest or risk most critical, then relaxing to allow economic activity. This cooperative balancing across states and weeks reduces cumulative cases and deaths better than uniform restrictions. Sensitivity to parameters like beta (transmission rate) and prevalence is high; higher beta or prevalence would necessitate stricter and earlier controls to prevent outbreaks, while lower values allow more relaxed measures. The fractions for each state sum exactly to 1, ensuring total inflow remains constant but redistributed over weeks to optimize epidemic control. This coordinated policy minimizes disease spread while permitting essential mobility."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the traffic control policy prioritizes reducing imported infections and deaths in Kentucky by balancing strict and relaxed traffic allocations across origin states and weeks. States with higher infection prevalence and inflow volumes, such as Tennessee, Indiana, and Ohio, employ strict-first or balanced patterns to reduce early week inflow and prevent sharp increases in imported cases. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or inflow adopt even or relaxed-first patterns to maintain economic mobility while managing risk. The total inbound flow per state remains constant, ensuring no reduction in volume but redistribution over weeks reduces peak risk. The imported infection risk for Kentucky is approximated as the sum over states and weeks of Flow * fraction * (I / population), thus lowering fractions in high-risk weeks or states reduces overall imported infections. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence rises or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter frontloading of controls may be required to maintain epidemic suppression. Conversely, if prevalence declines, more relaxed patterns can be adopted to support mobility. This coordinated, multi-state, multi-week approach minimizes Kentucky's cumulative confirmed cases and deaths while preserving necessary mobility. The exact sum of fractions to 1 per origin state maintains flow consistency and policy feasibility."

States with higher infected and exposed proportions relative to their populations, such as Idaho, Utah, Arkansas, Indiana, New Mexico, Ohio, and Tennessee, are assigned stricter traffic controls in the initial weeks (strict-first pattern). This approach reduces the immediate importation of new infections when prevalence is high, allowing Kentucky's healthcare system to better manage cases and reduce mortality. For states with moderate infection levels or stable trends, an even allocation pattern is applied to maintain balanced epidemic control and mobility, avoiding sharp fluctuations that could disrupt economic activities. States with lower infection pressure adopt relaxed-first patterns or even distributions to support mobility while managing risk. Quantitatively, imported infections are roughly proportional to the product of inbound flow fraction and the infected proportion in the origin state. By concentrating stricter controls early in high-risk states, the cumulative imported infections are suppressed, reducing secondary transmissions and deaths. This temporal balancing across weeks and spatial balancing across states ensures that no single week or origin state disproportionately contributes to epidemic resurgence. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter initial controls become even more critical. Conversely, if infection rates decline faster, controls can be relaxed sooner, enhancing mobility benefits. The recommended policy thus dynamically balances epidemic risk and economic activity, tailored to each origin state's epidemic profile and mobility baseline, ensuring the fractions sum to exactly one to preserve total inbound flow. This cooperative, data-driven approach helps Kentucky minimize imported infections and subsequent deaths effectively."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic allocation across all origin states collectively aims to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Kentucky by managing the timing and volume of inbound flows. States with higher infection prevalence and high flow, such as Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee, and Michigan, generally receive either even or strict-first patterns to suppress early importation risks. Lower prevalence or lower flow states often get even or relaxed-first patterns to balance epidemic control and maintain necessary mobility. The reasoning follows the logic that imported infections scale approximately with Flow * ft * (I / Population), so reducing traffic fractions during peak infection weeks reduces imported infections. The cooperation logic balances risk by temporally redistributing inbound flows: strict-first patterns reduce early importation to prevent seeding local outbreaks, while relaxed-first patterns allow gradual resumption of mobility as risk decreases. Even patterns distribute risk and mobility evenly, suitable for stable or moderate prevalence states. Sensitivity analysis suggests these allocations are robust: if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more critical, favoring strict-first patterns. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed or even patterns could be adopted to sustain mobility. The total fractions sum exactly to 1 for each state, preserving total inbound flow over 4 weeks, ensuring no net reduction in movement but temporal redistribution to optimize epidemic outcomes."

The imported infected cases roughly scale as Flow*f_t*(I/population). With a large inflow (12,007.6 daily), the risk is significant. To mitigate importation, we adopt a strict-first pattern, imposing stronger controls initially to curb early imported infections, then gradually relaxing.

  "global_guidance": "To collectively minimize imported cases and deaths in Kentucky, the traffic control policies focus on adjusting weekly flow fractions to reduce early imported infections from high-risk states (high I and E counts) with large inflows. States with high infected and exposed populations combined with high daily inflows (e.g., Tennessee, Indiana, Ohio, Alabama) adopt a strict-first pattern, front-loading traffic restrictions to mitigate early importation and reduce cumulative infections and mortality. Conversely, states with low inflow or lower infection pressure use even or relaxed-first patterns, balancing epidemic control with mobility to avoid undue economic disruption. This cross-state coordination smooths the epidemic pressure on Kentucky by distributing control efforts temporally and spatially, avoiding overwhelming importation peaks. Quantitatively, imported infected cases scale with Flow*f_t*(I/population), so reducing f_t in early weeks for high-risk states substantially lowers initial seeding of infections. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early control fractions would further benefit epidemic control. Conversely, lower prevalence or transmission would allow more relaxed controls without significant risk. Overall, this balanced, state-specific temporal allocation of inbound traffic fractions maintains total flow while strategically mitigating epidemic importation risk, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Kentucky."

States with high infected and exposed populations combined with high daily inflows (e.g., Tennessee, Indiana, Ohio, Alabama) adopt a strict-first pattern, front-loading traffic restrictions to mitigate early importation and reduce cumulative infections and mortality. Conversely, states with low inflow or lower infection pressure use even or relaxed-first patterns, balancing epidemic control with mobility to avoid undue economic disruption. This cross-state coordination smooths the epidemic pressure on Kentucky by distributing control efforts temporally and spatially, avoiding overwhelming importation peaks. Quantitatively, imported infected cases scale with Flow*f_t*(I/population), so reducing f_t in early weeks for high-risk states substantially lowers initial seeding of infections. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early control fractions would further benefit epidemic control. Conversely, lower prevalence or transmission would allow more relaxed controls without significant risk. Overall, this balanced, state-specific temporal allocation of inbound traffic fractions maintains total flow while strategically mitigating epidemic importation risk, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Kentucky.'

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy balances inbound traffic control across states and weeks to reduce cumulative imported infections and deaths in Kentucky. States with high infected and exposed populations relative to their size (e.g., Idaho, Indiana, Michigan, Utah) receive stricter early control (lower f1 fractions), delaying travel to later weeks as local outbreaks potentially subside or interventions take effect. This strict-first or relaxed-first pattern aims to flatten and delay infection importations, preventing acute spikes in Kentucky. Lower-risk states (e.g., Mississippi, Iowa) maintain even distributions to avoid unnecessary economic disruption. The total inbound flow per origin state remains constant by ensuring fractions sum exactly to one, preserving overall mobility while smoothing temporal risk. Cooperative risk balancing across states reduces the likelihood that multiple high-risk states simultaneously send large infected flows, decreasing cumulative epidemic pressure. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increase, stricter early control and longer delays would be needed to maintain effectiveness. Conversely, lower prevalence or beta would allow more relaxed early weeks. This adaptive, data-driven approach optimizes epidemic control and mobility by dynamically distributing inbound traffic to minimize Kentucky's epidemic burden."

The risk of imported infections is proportional to Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)), and given the large inbound flow (~23k daily), the state poses a consistent infection pressure. Since Alabama's infection prevalence does not show a clear increasing or decreasing trend, an even distribution of traffic control (equal fractions) is chosen to maintain steady control while allowing mobility. This balances epidemic control and economic considerations without unnecessary spikes in risk. The sum of fractions is exactly 1, validating the allocation."

The inbound flow (~2.65k) is smaller but still significant. We expect imported infections ~ Flow*ft*(I/population). Given the moderate infection pressure and the goal to reduce cases in Kentucky, we adopt a strict-first pattern, reducing traffic more in earlier weeks (high control early) to prevent initial seeding of infections. This approach slows down importation when prevalence might be more impactful. The fractions sum exactly to 1, respecting constraints."

Imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/population). Given slightly high infection prevalence, a semi-strict-first pattern is chosen to front-load stricter controls in the first two weeks, then relax later as risk potentially decreases or to balance mobility needs.

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce imported infections and deaths in Kentucky, the allocation of inbound flows from all origin states balances epidemic control and mobility. States with higher infection prevalence (I/population) and/or larger inbound flows receive stricter traffic control earlier (low fractions in initial weeks) to minimize early seeding of infections. Conversely, states with lower infection pressures or more stable epidemics have even or relaxed-first patterns to allow economic activity while maintaining control. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections from each origin state scale as Flow*ft*(I/population), so weighting traffic control more heavily in weeks when infection pressure is higher or when imported infections could cause larger outbreaks is efficient. This cooperative balancing across states and weeks reduces the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Kentucky by preventing synchronized importation peaks and allowing manageable, staggered inflows. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become more critical. Conversely, if prevalence reduces due to vaccination or other measures, controls can be relaxed earlier. This dynamic, data-driven approach adapts to epidemic trends in origin states to optimize Kentucky's epidemic outcomes while preserving necessary mobility."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations collectively aim to minimize imported infections into Kentucky by adjusting weekly flow fractions according to each origin state's infection prevalence and exposure levels. States with higher infected and exposed populations, like Tennessee, South Carolina, and Michigan, are assigned stricter controls in earlier weeks (strict-first or relaxed-first patterns) to reduce initial seeding risk. Lower-risk states or those with moderate infection levels receive even traffic distribution to balance epidemic control and economic activity. This cross-state approach balances the total inbound flow constant per state while redistributing traffic temporally to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Kentucky. Quantitatively, imported infections are approximated by Flow * ft * (I / population), so reducing ft in weeks with higher infection prevalence lowers imported cases. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence fluctuates or transmission rates (beta) change, the temporal allocation can adapt by shifting stricter controls to weeks or states with rising infection pressure. This flexible strategy enhances robustness against uncertainties in epidemic dynamics. Overall, the policy prioritizes early containment of high-risk inbound flows while allowing gradual relaxation to sustain mobility and economic functions."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Kentucky, inbound traffic control allocations are designed to mitigate the importation of infections while balancing mobility needs. States with higher infection prevalence (high I relative to population) such as Idaho, Arkansas, Utah, and Tennessee adopt a strict-first pattern, reducing inbound flow in initial and final weeks to prevent seeding outbreaks early or sustaining transmission late in the month. States with moderate to high infections but large population sizes (e.g., Ohio, Texas, Michigan) use a relaxed-first pattern, allowing some mobility mid-period when control capacity may be stronger, and stricter control at edges to damp importation risk. States with lower infection prevalence generally have even distributions to maintain consistent control and mobility. Quantitatively, expected imported infections scale with the product of daily flow, traffic fraction, and infection prevalence (I/population). By redistributing the fixed total inbound flow over the weeks, we leverage temporal control to reduce peak infection importation pressure. Cross-state cooperation ensures that stricter control in one high-risk state complements relaxed control in lower-risk states, balancing overall risk. Sensitivity to prevalence or transmission rates (beta) suggests that if infection rates rise, stricter patterns should be adopted earlier; conversely, a decline supports more relaxed mobility. This approach optimizes traffic flows to reduce the risk of imported cases and consequential deaths while preserving essential mobility and economic activity."

The imported infected estimate is roughly Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)), meaning higher infected proportions and larger flow increase risk. Given Alabama's consistent infection levels, a strict-first pattern is chosen to minimize initial importation, easing controls gradually to balance mobility.

  "global_guidance": "The proposed inbound traffic allocations aim to collectively minimize imported infections and deaths by carefully adjusting weekly flow fractions per origin state, maintaining total inbound flow constant. States with higher infected and exposed prevalence, such as Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Alabama, receive stricter control early in the 4-week horizon (strict-first pattern), lowering immediate import pressure on Kentucky's health system and allowing progressive reopening. States with moderate or stable infection levels adopt even distributions to balance epidemic risk and economic activity, avoiding weekly spikes that could overwhelm resources. For states with smaller inflows but relatively high infection rates, a relaxed-first pattern allows some early mobility while imposing stricter controls later, mitigating risk as trends evolve. This cooperative distribution balances risk temporally and spatially across states, reducing peak importation risk and smoothing economic impact. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become more critical, reinforcing the chosen patterns. Conversely, if prevalence declines, mobility could be relaxed sooner. Maintaining exact fraction sums to 1 ensures total inbound flow consistency, preserving economic and logistic feasibility. This dynamic allocation strategy effectively manages importation risk, supporting Kentucky's epidemic control objectives while balancing mobility needs."

  "global_guidance": "The collective strategy for Kentucky's inbound traffic is designed to minimize imported infections and consequent deaths by adjusting weekly flow fractions based on each origin state's infection prevalence and mobility inflow. States with high infection prevalence but low flow, such as Utah and New Mexico, adopt strict-first patterns with stronger early controls to prevent seeding infections early, relaxing controls later as the epidemic stabilizes. High flow states with moderate infection prevalence like Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee, and Alabama use even patterns to spread traffic evenly across weeks, preventing spikes that could overwhelm epidemic control in Kentucky. States with moderate infection prevalence and moderate flow, such as Arkansas and Michigan, use relaxed-first patterns to balance economic and social mobility needs initially while tightening controls later to reduce cumulative risk. The quantitative cooperation logic relies on the approximate formula for imported infections per week: Flow*ft*(I/pop), where I/pop estimates infection prevalence. By modulating ft weekly, the policy reduces initial imported infections when risk is high and allows relaxation when risk diminishes, optimizing the trade-off between epidemic control and mobility. Sensitivity analyses show that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases in any origin state, stricter early controls (lower ft in early weeks) become more impactful. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta reduces, more relaxed patterns can be adopted safely. This flexible allocation strategy thus ensures the total inbound flow remains constant (summing ft=1), preserving mobility needs while minimizing epidemic risks in Kentucky."

States with high infection prevalence but low flow, such as Utah and New Mexico, adopt strict-first patterns with stronger early controls to prevent seeding infections early, relaxing controls later as the epidemic stabilizes. High flow states with moderate infection prevalence like Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee, and Alabama use even patterns to spread traffic evenly across weeks, preventing spikes that could overwhelm epidemic control in Kentucky. States with moderate infection prevalence and moderate flow, such as Arkansas and Michigan, use relaxed-first patterns to balance economic and social mobility needs initially while tightening controls later to reduce cumulative risk. The quantitative cooperation logic relies on the approximate formula for imported infections per week: Flow*ft*(I/pop), where I/pop estimates infection prevalence. By modulating ft weekly, the policy reduces initial imported infections when risk is high and allows relaxation when risk diminishes, optimizing the trade-off between epidemic control and mobility. Sensitivity analyses show that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases in any origin state, stricter early controls (lower ft in early weeks) become more impactful. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta reduces, more relaxed patterns can be adopted safely. This flexible allocation strategy thus ensures the total inbound flow remains constant (summing ft=1), preserving mobility needs while minimizing epidemic risks in Kentucky."

  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic control policy across all origin states strategically balances epidemic control and mobility to minimize Kentucky's cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. States with higher infected prevalence and larger inflows, such as Ohio, Indiana, and Tennessee, receive stricter early-week traffic restrictions (strict-first pattern) to reduce initial seeding and subsequent community transmission. This front-loading of control delays and diminishes imported infections during the critical early period. States with moderate infection levels and steady inflows, like Arizona, Minnesota, Nebraska, Texas, and Wisconsin, adopt even traffic allocations to maintain consistent but controlled mobility, reducing sudden spikes in imported cases. Others with elevated infection prevalence but smaller inflows (e.g., Arkansas, Idaho, Utah) apply a strict-first pattern with mid-period focus to contain risk effectively. Quantitatively, expected imported infections approximate Flow * fraction * (I/S), guiding the modulation of fractions. Ensuring each origin state's fractions sum to exactly one preserves total inbound flow, maintaining overall mobility while adjusting temporal distribution for optimal epidemic outcomes. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence increases or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early restrictions become more critical, whereas if prevalence decreases, more relaxed allocations may suffice to restore mobility. This coordinated, data-driven approach leverages cross-state cooperation, balancing imported infection risks across weeks and origins to effectively mitigate Kentucky's epidemic burden."

  "global_guidance": "In setting inbound traffic allocations for Kentucky from all origin states, the key objective is to minimize cumulative COVID-19 confirmed and deceased cases by controlling imported infections. The risk of infection importation is proportional to the product of daily inbound flow, weekly fraction allocation, and the infected-to-susceptible ratio of the origin state: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / S). States with higher infected and exposed relative to susceptible populations pose greater infection pressure, warranting stricter controls early in the 4-week horizon to reduce immediate importation risk. Conversely, states with lower or stable infection pressure can maintain even or gradually relaxed traffic control patterns to preserve essential mobility. The allocation patterns vary by state: strict-first (frontloaded restrictions) for high-risk states (e.g., Alabama, Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee), relaxed-first for states with early high infection pressure but potential control later (e.g., Idaho, Utah), and even patterns for stable risk states (e.g., Arizona, New Mexico, Texas). This cross-state strategy collectively reduces the expected imported infected population into Kentucky by balancing temporal restrictions and mobility needs. Quantitatively, allocating fractions to minimize peak imported infections reduces secondary transmission and deaths within Kentucky. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early restrictions become more critical. Conversely, if prevalence declines or vaccination coverage improves, more relaxed or even patterns may suffice. The strict adherence to fractions summing exactly to 1 ensures the total inbound flow remains constant, preserving essential economic and social connectivity while optimizing epidemic control. This balanced approach aligns with Kentucky's epidemic parameters and its goal to mitigate COVID-19 impact while sustaining mobility."

    "notes": "Alabama has a population with relatively low infection prevalence (I=1117) compared to its large susceptible population (S=4762746), suggesting moderate infection pressure. Using the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population), with a high flow of 13692.57 but low infection ratio, importation risk is moderate. We apply a strict-first pattern, reducing flow most in week 1 (0.35) and gradually relaxing. Early strict control limits immediate importation, protecting Kentucky's susceptible population. The trade-off balances economic mobility and epidemic control by frontloading restrictions when infection risk is higher. The fractions sum exactly to 1."

The infection prevalence is moderate but non-negligible. The imported infection estimate is Flow * ft * (I / population). Given a smaller average inflow (3230.96), the risk is still notable. A strict-first pattern (heaviest restriction early) helps control early seeding, especially given Arizona's higher infection burden. Later weeks have relaxed controls to reduce economic harm.

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce expected imported infections and deaths in Kentucky, the traffic control policy prioritizes early-week restrictions (strict-first pattern) from high-risk states with large infected/exposed populations and/or high inflow, such as Tennessee, Indiana, Ohio, Arkansas, Alabama, Mississippi, and Michigan. This frontloads control measures to minimize early seeding, critical for epidemic control. States with lower inflow or lower prevalence, such as Idaho, Utah, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, receive even allocation to avoid unnecessary economic strain while maintaining steady control. The quantitative cooperation logic balances temporal infection pressures across states and weeks: by reducing early importation from high-risk origins, we reduce downstream cases and deaths in Kentucky. The sum of fractions for each origin state is exactly 1, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant but temporally optimized. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence (I or E) increases in any state, stricter early restrictions from that state should intensify, while if transmission rate beta increases, all controls should become stricter to counteract higher epidemic growth. Conversely, if prevalence or beta decrease, controls can be relaxed gradually. This flexible, data-driven allocation optimizes epidemic control while considering mobility and economic impacts."

The infection prevalence (I/S) is about 7.9e-05, which is moderate. The expected imported infected individuals are proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), thus delaying traffic to later weeks helps reduce immediate importation risk. The chosen pattern is strict-first, applying stricter control in earlier weeks (0.30, 0.25) and relaxing later (0.25, 0.20), to minimize early seeding of infections. The trade-off balances economic mobility by allowing gradual reopening while controlling early spread. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Kentucky, inbound traffic allocations are coordinated to reduce imported infections especially during early weeks when local infections are still manageable. States with higher infection prevalence (Arkansas, Idaho, South Carolina) and high inbound flow (Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee) are assigned stricter early controls (strict-first pattern) to delay and reduce the seeding of infections into Kentucky. This reduces the risk of early epidemic escalation locally. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure or lower inbound flow use even or relaxed-first patterns to balance epidemic control and economic mobility, ensuring no abrupt disruptions and allowing some level of steady traffic. The total inbound flow from each state remains constant over 4 weeks, only the timing changes to smooth importation risks over time. This temporal redistribution lowers peak imported infections and allows Kentucky's health system time to absorb cases without being overwhelmed. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase in origin states, stricter early controls would become more critical to avoid importation spikes. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, allocations could relax earlier. The current policy thus adapts traffic control dynamically based on infection pressure and flow magnitude, optimizing the trade-off between epidemic control and economic mobility across states and weeks. This cooperative, balanced approach minimizes imported infection risk and consequent deaths, while preserving essential mobility."

The infected proportion is approximately I/S ~ 8.6e-5, indicating moderate infection pressure. Since inbound flow is significant (40590 daily), the expected imported infected roughly scales as Flow*ft*(I/S). We choose a strict-first pattern, front-loading stricter controls in week 1 and 2 (fractions 0.30, 0.25), then gradually relaxing to 0.25 and 0.20 in weeks 3 and 4. This reduces immediate imported infections, allowing the state to manage local spread early. The trade-off is some mobility restriction upfront, but overall flow is preserved.

Given relatively steady prevalence and smaller flow, an even fraction allocation is reasonable to avoid abrupt mobility changes while maintaining steady epidemic control.

  "global_guidance": "Across all origin states, the traffic control policy aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Kentucky by strategically allocating inbound traffic fractions over the next 4 weeks. States with higher infection prevalence (I/S ratio) and significant inbound flow to Kentucky adopt a strict-first pattern, frontloading stricter controls in early weeks to reduce early importation of infectious individuals, which is critical to lowering community transmission and deaths. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or smaller inflows use even distributions to maintain steady mobility without compromising control. This cooperative approach balances epidemic risk across weeks and states, smoothing mobility impacts while targeting periods of highest importation risk. Quantitatively, expected imported infections per week from each state scale as Flow*ft*(I/S). By reducing ft in the initial weeks for high-risk states, we reduce these early imported infections when local control is most sensitive. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence increases or transmission parameters (e.g., beta) rise, stricter early controls become even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence drops, fractions could be relaxed earlier. This policy thus dynamically balances epidemic control and economic mobility across Kentucky's inter-state network, optimizing health outcomes while preserving necessary travel."
