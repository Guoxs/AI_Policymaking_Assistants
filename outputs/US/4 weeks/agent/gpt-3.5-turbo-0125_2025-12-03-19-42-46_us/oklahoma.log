The imported infected cases can be approximated by Flow*ft*(I/S). Given that Alabama's infection pressure appears stable or slightly decreasing, a strict-first pattern is adopted to reduce early week inflow to Oklahoma, minimizing initial imported infections. This pattern helps avoid a surge in Oklahoma's cases early on, while gradually relaxing restrictions as the risk reduces. The trade-off balances epidemic control by containing high-risk weeks early with mobility needs by relaxing later weeks.

  "global_guidance": "The traffic control policy for Oklahoma's inbound flow from various origin states strategically balances epidemic control and mobility preservation. States with high infection and exposure prevalence relative to their susceptible populations, such as South Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, Idaho, and Michigan, receive stricter control in the early weeks (strict-first pattern). This approach minimizes the import of infectious individuals when the risk is highest, reducing the potential for outbreaks within Oklahoma. Conversely, states with lower infection pressures or very large inflow volumes, like Texas, Arkansas, Wisconsin, and Iowa, adopt an even distribution pattern to avoid abrupt mobility disruptions that could affect critical socioeconomic activities. The logic behind fraction assignments relies on the formula imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/S), where Flow is the average inflow from the origin state, ft is the traffic fraction at week t, I is infected count, and S is susceptible population. By allocating lower fractions (stricter controls) during weeks with higher infection pressure, the policy reduces the expected number of infectious imported cases cumulatively over four weeks while maintaining the total inbound flow constant. This coordinated balancing acts as a multi-state cooperation where states with higher risk contribute to early epidemic containment, while others support sustained mobility, collectively minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Oklahoma. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if disease transmissibility (beta) or prevalence in origin states increases, stricter early controls should be emphasized more. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccination/immunity rises, more relaxed patterns could be safely adopted. The fraction sums are carefully validated to equal 1 for each state, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant, fulfilling the task constraints. This structured approach aligns epidemic dynamics with mobility policy to optimize public health outcomes and economic vitality for Oklahoma."

States with high infection and exposure prevalence relative to their susceptible populations, such as South Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, Idaho, and Michigan, receive stricter control in the early weeks (strict-first pattern). This approach minimizes the import of infectious individuals when the risk is highest, reducing the potential for outbreaks within Oklahoma. Conversely, states with lower infection pressures or very large inflow volumes, like Texas, Arkansas, Wisconsin, and Iowa, adopt an even distribution pattern to avoid abrupt mobility disruptions that could affect critical socioeconomic activities. The logic behind fraction assignments relies on the formula imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/S), where Flow is the average inflow from the origin state, ft is the traffic fraction at week t, I is infected count, and S is susceptible population. By allocating lower fractions (stricter controls) during weeks with higher infection pressure, the policy reduces the expected number of infectious imported cases cumulatively over four weeks while maintaining the total inbound flow constant. This coordinated balancing acts as a multi-state cooperation where states with higher risk contribute to early epidemic containment, while others support sustained mobility, collectively minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Oklahoma. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if disease transmissibility (beta) or prevalence in origin states increases, stricter early controls should be emphasized more. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccination/immunity rises, more relaxed patterns could be safely adopted. The fraction sums are carefully validated to equal 1 for each state, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant, fulfilling the task constraints.

  "global_guidance": "The overall inbound traffic allocation strategy for Oklahoma balances epidemic control and mobility by adjusting weekly proportions per origin state while maintaining total flow constant. States with high infected and exposed counts relative to their population, such as Arkansas, Michigan, Tennessee, and Idaho, adopt strict-first patterns with lower traffic in early weeks to reduce immediate importation risk. This allows Oklahoma's healthcare system to manage incoming cases better and prevents early spikes in infections and deaths. On the other hand, states with moderate or lower infection pressure, such as Alabama, Iowa, Utah, and Minnesota, use even patterns to maintain steady flow over time, minimizing disruption while controlling risk. Relaxed-first patterns are chosen for states with rising or moderate infection trends, such as Arizona, Indiana, Ohio, and Texas, to delay some flow to later weeks when Oklahoma may have better epidemic readiness or lower local prevalence. This staggered approach distributes risk temporally and geographically, reducing the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. The quantitative cooperation logic is based on estimating imported infections as roughly proportional to the product of inbound flow, weekly fraction, and infected proportion in the origin state population (Flow*ft*(I/population)). By allocating lower fractions in higher-risk weeks and states, the policy mitigates peaks and balances mobility needs. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter front-loaded controls would be necessary to prevent rapid case escalation, whereas if prevalence drops or beta decreases, allocations could be relaxed earlier to support mobility. This flexible, data-driven approach dynamically balances epidemic risks and socioeconomic needs to minimize cumulative adverse outcomes in Oklahoma."

The expected imported infections can be approximated as imported_infected ~ Flow * f_t * (I / total_population). Given the relatively stable infection pressure and large population, a balanced even pattern is chosen to distribute traffic equally across the four weeks, avoiding sudden spikes of imported infections. This pattern balances epidemic control and mobility needs, maintaining consistent inbound flow without overburdening any particular week. The fractions sum exactly to 1, validating the allocation."

The expected imported infected depends on Flow * f_t * (I / population). The infection prevalence suggests a slight relaxation in later weeks when prevalence may decline naturally or through local control, thus a relaxed-first pattern is chosen with higher fractions in weeks 3 and 4. This allows stricter control initially to reduce imported infections when risk is higher, then gradual relaxation to support mobility. The fractions sum to 1 with four decimals precision."

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic allocations aim to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Oklahoma by balancing imported infection risks across all origin states and weeks. States with higher infection prevalence relative to populationsuch as Arkansas, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Texasare assigned a strict-first pattern, imposing greater restrictions in the initial weeks to reduce early imported infections when risk is highest. This front-loading of control helps prevent seeding and acceleration of outbreaks in Oklahoma. States with lower prevalence or smaller inbound flows (e.g., Alabama, Iowa, Nebraska, South Carolina) have even distributions, maintaining steady but moderate inbound flow to support economic activity without sudden spikes in risk. Relaxed-first patterns were avoided because increasing flow early risks importing infections when local immunity or containment may be insufficient. The sum of fractions for each state is verified to be exactly 1 (to 3-4 decimals), ensuring total inbound flow matches ground truth over 4 weeks. Quantitatively, imported infections are proportional to Flow * f_t * (I / population), so adjusting f_t modulates weekly risk. By spreading imported infections away from early weeks in high-risk states, the policy reduces secondary transmission and fatalities in Oklahoma. Sensitivity analysis suggests if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter or longer restrictions would be warranted, making the strict-first pattern more beneficial. Conversely, if prevalence declines, the fractions could be shifted towards relaxed or even patterns to restore mobility sooner. This cooperative inter-state balancing of inbound traffic, tailored by infection pressure and flow magnitude, optimally mitigates epidemic risk while preserving essential mobility."

The imported infected cases can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population), which remains moderate due to low I/population. Given the moderate epidemic pressure and stable inflow, an even pattern of traffic allocation is chosen to balance mobility with epidemic control.

This reduces seeding of infections in Oklahoma, aligning with the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/population). Conversely, states with lower or moderate infection prevalence adopt even or relaxed-first patterns, balancing epidemic control and mobility to maintain economic activity and social connectivity without excessively increasing risk. The fraction vectors for all states sum to 1, preserving total inbound traffic volume over 4 weeks, ensuring fairness and predictability in traffic management. This coordinated approach balances inter-state epidemic pressures, preventing spikes in imported infections by temporally distributing traffic restrictions to when they are most effective. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early controls would be even more critical to prevent outbreaks. Alternatively, if prevalence drops or vaccination increases, allocations could relax earlier.

  "global_guidance": "The overall traffic control strategy for Oklahoma's inbound flows balances strong early restrictions on states with higher infection prevalence and significant inflow, while allowing more relaxed policies for low-risk origins and those with very high volumes to maintain essential mobility. The priority is minimizing early imported infections which seed local outbreaks; thus, most states follow a strict-first pattern allocating lower fractions of inbound flow in weeks 1 and 2, gradually relaxing controls in weeks 3 and 4. For states with very large inflow but moderate infected counts (e.g., Texas), an even distribution mitigates severe mobility disruptions while still spreading risk reduction over the month. The expected imported infected cases from each state roughly scale with the product of their inflow, fraction of flow allowed each week, and their infection prevalence (I/population). By adjusting fractions over weeks, we front-load restrictions to suppress seeding, then allow gradual restoration of mobility to balance economic and social needs. Cross-state cooperation is achieved by distributing restrictions proportionally to their infection risks and flow volumes, preventing any single origin from overwhelming Oklahoma's epidemic control. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early restrictions would be more beneficial, whereas if prevalence decreases or beta is low, more relaxed or even distributions suffice. This dynamic allocation approach helps minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Oklahoma while maintaining reasonable mobility."

The infection prevalence is low (I/S ~ 0.00015), so imported infections depend heavily on flow and weekly fractions. Given the steady infection level and moderate flow (4080 daily), an even distribution pattern is chosen. This balances epidemic control with mobility needs, ensuring no week is overly restrictive or relaxed. The imported infected count per week is approximately Flow * ft * (I/S), so keeping ft constant avoids spikes in imported risk. Trade-offs favor stable flow to reduce economic and social disruption. The fractions sum to exactly 1 (0.25*4=1)."

The inbound flow is 7493 daily, relatively high. Given slightly increasing infection pressure, a relaxed-first pattern in weeks 2 and 3 is chosen to allow some mobility recovery, while weeks 1 and 4 are more restrictive. This balances the risk of importing infections while allowing economic activity. Imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/S), so concentrating flow mid-period with lower flow start/end reduces peak pressure at critical times.

  "global_guidance": "To collectively minimize imported infections and deaths in Oklahoma, the inbound traffic allocations are balanced across origin states and weeks based on infection prevalence, exposed and infected ratios, and flow magnitude. States with higher infected proportions and large inbound flows, such as Arkansas and Texas, receive stricter controls earlier to suppress imported infection pressure when Oklahoma's local epidemic is vulnerable. Gradual relaxation in later weeks supports economic recovery while managing risk. Lower prevalence states or those with smaller flows maintain more balanced or strict-first patterns to avoid sudden spikes in imported cases. The quantitative logic follows that imported infected cases scale as Flow * ft * (I / S), so adjusting ft weekly redistributes infection pressure to avoid overwhelming local healthcare. Cross-state coordination ensures no week accumulates excessive imported infections from multiple sources simultaneously, thus smoothing epidemic risk. Sensitivity analyses indicate that higher transmission rates (beta) or increased prevalence in origin states would necessitate more conservative early-week restrictions to prevent surges, while lower prevalence or beta allow more even or relaxed policies. This strategy balances epidemic control with mobility needs, mitigating health risks while supporting social and economic functions. All fractions sum exactly to 1 per state, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant over four weeks as required."

The expected imported infections are roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/S+E), where Flow is the inbound traffic and ft are fractions per week. Given a moderate infection level and a large average inflow, a relaxed-first pattern is chosen to allow some mobility early but increasing control as the weeks progress to mitigate risk. Balancing economic activity and health risks, the first week is less strict (0.20), then slightly relaxed (0.25), and finally stricter in week 3 (0.30) with some relaxation in week 4 (0.25). The fractions sum exactly to 1, validating the allocation."

We adopt a relaxed-first pattern: starting with low fractions to allow some mobility (0.15), then stepping up control in week 3 (0.35) to reduce cumulative cases, and slightly relaxing in week 4 (0.30).

The weekly fractions are carefully balanced such that the total inbound flow over 4 weeks remains constant, ensuring no loss of economic mobility but redistributing risk temporally to better manage healthcare capacity and reduce transmission. States with higher infection and exposed prevalence, especially those with large inflows such as Texas, Arkansas, and Arizona, are assigned stricter controls earlier or more heavily weighted restrictions in weeks 3 and 4 to minimize imported infections when their infectious pressure is high. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or smaller inflows are assigned more even or slightly relaxed-first fractions to maintain economic activity while still managing risk. The quantitative logic relies on estimating imported infections as proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), balancing the need to maintain total flow with temporal redistribution of risk. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence increases or the transmission rate beta rises, intensifying restrictions earlier would be more effective, whereas lower prevalence or beta allows for more relaxed early control. Collective risk balancing across states and weeks reduces cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Oklahoma by smoothing the imported infection curve and avoiding simultaneous surges from multiple origins. This cooperative and temporally adaptive approach maximizes epidemic control benefits while preserving mobility and economic function."

Expected imported infections roughly scale with Flow*ft*(I/population). Given stable infections, an even distribution across 4 weeks is chosen to balance mobility and epidemic control, avoiding sudden spikes or drops in traffic. This pattern minimizes risk by not relaxing controls early when Oklahoma still has moderate infected (I=1034) and exposed (E=1353) populations.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies collectively aim to minimize imported infections and deaths in Oklahoma by strategically adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions per origin state based on their infection prevalence and mobility volumes. States with higher infection prevalence and/or large inbound flows (e.g., Arkansas, Texas, South Carolina) adopt a relaxed-first pattern with stricter controls in early weeks to protect Oklahoma's still significant exposed and infected population. This reduces early imported infection risk when local control is critical. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller flows (e.g., Alabama, Virginia, Nebraska) maintain even distributions to balance epidemic control and economic mobility evenly. The quantitative logic relies on the proportionality of imported infections to inbound flow times the infected fraction of the origin population. By maintaining the overall total inbound flow constant but shifting fractions towards later weeks for high-risk states, the approach reduces simultaneous importation pressure, allowing Oklahoma's epidemic to stabilize or decline before facing higher mobility. Sensitivity analysis suggests if origin infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter controls or more front-loaded restrictions would be warranted to prevent surges. Conversely, if local recovery accelerates or beta decreases, controls could be relaxed earlier.

States with higher infection prevalence and/or large inbound flows (e.g., Arkansas, Texas, South Carolina) adopt a relaxed-first pattern with stricter controls in early weeks to protect Oklahoma's still significant exposed and infected population. This reduces early imported infection risk when local control is critical. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller flows (e.g., Alabama, Virginia, Nebraska) maintain even distributions to balance epidemic control and economic mobility evenly. The quantitative logic relies on the proportionality of imported infections to inbound flow times the infected fraction of the origin population. By maintaining the overall total inbound flow constant but shifting fractions towards later weeks for high-risk states, the approach reduces simultaneous importation pressure, allowing Oklahoma's epidemic to stabilize or decline before facing higher mobility. Sensitivity analysis suggests if origin infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter controls or more front-loaded restrictions would be warranted to prevent surges. Conversely, if local recovery accelerates or beta decreases, controls could be relaxed earlier. This coordinated, differentiated approach balances epidemic control with mobility needs, reduces cumulative cases and deaths, and ensures traffic patterns sum to exactly one per state, preserving total mobility volume while modulating temporal risk."

The imported infected cases can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population), with population roughly the sum of S+E+I+Q+R+D ~ 4,871,965. Since the infected proportion is relatively low but non-negligible, a strict-first pattern is chosen to apply stronger controls in the earlier weeks (f1=0.35, f2=0.3) to immediately reduce imported infections and thus lower the initial epidemic pressure in Oklahoma. The later weeks see progressively relaxed control (f3=0.2, f4=0.15). This balances the need to protect Oklahoma early while gradually restoring mobility. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Oklahoma, the policy collectively applies stricter controls in the earlier weeks for origin states with higher infection prevalence and/or inbound flow. This front-loaded approach reduces early introduction of exposed and infected individuals, which is critical since early seeding can lead to exponential growth in local cases. Origin states with high infected counts and large flows (e.g., Texas, Arkansas, Michigan) have stronger early restrictions (up to 40% of flow limited in week 1) to sharply reduce initial importation risk. States with lower infected prevalence or lower flow apply moderate front-loaded restrictions (around 30% in week 1 and 2). For states with relatively low flow or prevalence (e.g., Idaho), an even traffic control pattern is used to balance mobility and epidemic control without overburdening travel. The total inbound flow from each origin state is conserved over the 4 weeks, but weekly fractions sum exactly to 1 to maintain flow constancy. This cooperation across states balances epidemic risk temporally and spatially, reducing the probability of simultaneous large importations. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stronger front-loaded restrictions would be even more beneficial to curb imported infections early. Conversely, if local control in Oklahoma improves (e.g., lower local I), some relaxation could be considered.

This front-loaded approach reduces early introduction of exposed and infected individuals, which is critical since early seeding can lead to exponential growth in local cases. Origin states with high infected counts and large flows (e.g., Texas, Arkansas, Michigan) have stronger early restrictions (up to 40percent of flow limited in week 1) to sharply reduce initial importation risk. States with lower infected prevalence or lower flow apply moderate front-loaded restrictions (around 30percent in week 1 and 2). For states with relatively low flow or prevalence (e.g., Idaho), an even traffic control pattern is used to balance mobility and epidemic control without overburdening travel. The total inbound flow from each origin state is conserved over the 4 weeks, but weekly fractions sum exactly to 1 to maintain flow constancy. This cooperation across states balances epidemic risk temporally and spatially, reducing the probability of simultaneous large importations. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stronger front-loaded restrictions would be even more beneficial to curb imported infections early. Conversely, if local control in Oklahoma improves (e.g., lower local I), some relaxation could be considered. Overall, the recommended staggered strict-first pattern optimally balances epidemic control and mobility preservation, minimizing cumulative cases and deaths in Oklahoma.'

The imported infected cases can be approximated by Flow * ft * (I / population), indicating that controlling flow in weeks with higher infectious prevalence would reduce risk. Given that Alabama's infection levels are relatively stable and moderate, an even distribution pattern is chosen to balance epidemic control and mobility. Strict control early or late is not clearly justified by trends, so evenly spread fractions of 0.25 each week are recommended. This approach reduces potential spikes in imported infections without overly restricting mobility in any single week. The fractions sum to exactly 1, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, these inbound traffic allocations aim to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Oklahoma by strategically adjusting weekly flow fractions to control imported infection risk. States with higher infected and exposed counts relative to their populations (e.g., Arkansas, Michigan, Ohio, Utah) receive stricter control early in the 4-week period or employ relaxed-first patterns, delaying higher flows until infection pressure is expected to decline. This timing helps reduce early imported infections when Oklahoma's epidemic burden is significant. States with moderate or low prevalence maintain even flow distributions to avoid unnecessary mobility restrictions that could adversely affect socio-economic factors. The total inbound flow from each origin is preserved by ensuring fractions sum precisely to 1, maintaining consistency with ground truth data. This cooperation across states balances importation risks by distributing traffic more heavily to weeks with lower infection prevalence or lower transmission risk, effectively smoothing infection pressure on Oklahoma's health system. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence increases in any origin state, stricter early controls (lower fractions) should be prioritized to prevent spikes in imported cases. Similarly, if the transmission rate beta increases, earlier and stricter flow controls become more critical. Conversely, if prevalence or beta decrease, a more relaxed or even traffic pattern can be adopted to support mobility. These policies are adaptive and rely on continuous monitoring of origin states' epidemic parameters to optimize inbound traffic dynamically."

    "notes": "Alabama shows a low infected proportion relative to its large susceptible population (I=423 out of ~4.8M S), indicating moderate infection pressure. Using the formula imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), we expect infection import proportional to I and inflow. To reduce importation risk early, a strict-first pattern is chosen, allocating lower fractions in week 1 (0.3) and gradually relaxing. This balances epidemic control with mobility needs, as early reduction lowers seeding risk, while later weeks allow increased flow to support economic activity. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.3+0.25+0.25+0.2=1.0), validating allocation."

    "notes": "Arizona has relatively higher infected numbers (I=1279) but also a large population. Given consistent prevalence without clear trend, an even distribution of fractions is selected to maintain stable control over four weeks. This strategy spreads risk evenly, minimizing sudden surges in imported cases. The trade-off balances steady epidemic suppression with continuous mobility. Fractions sum to 1 exactly (4 x 0.25), ensuring consistent total inflow."

A relaxed-first pattern is selected, with lighter control early (0.2) and stronger control mid-weeks (0.3, 0.3), then easing later. This pattern anticipates possible epidemic worsening mid-period, enforcing stricter control when import risk peaks. Trade-offs involve temporary mobility restrictions offset by reduced infections.

  "global_guidance": "To collectively minimize imported infections and deaths in Oklahoma, the policy distributes inbound traffic control strategically based on origin states' infection prevalence and inflow magnitude. States with high infected counts and/or large inflow volumes (e.g., Texas, Arkansas, Michigan) use relaxed-first or strict-first patterns to apply stricter control during weeks with anticipated higher risk, limiting seeding events early or mid-period. States with moderate or low infection prevalence and smaller flows use even distributions to maintain consistent control without abrupt mobility disruptions. The cooperation logic ensures total monthly inflow remains constant per origin, but timing shifts reduce infection pressure peaks by flattening inbound infection load. This temporal balancing reduces epidemic growth potential in Oklahoma. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission (beta) increases, stricter early-week controls become more critical to prevent rapid spread. Conversely, if prevalence declines or beta reduces, control can be relaxed more evenly. This adaptive allocation framework supports dynamic epidemic control while sustaining essential mobility and economic functions across states."

The expected imported infected individuals weekly is proportional to Flow * ft * (I / Population). Given the relatively stable infection and exposed counts, I recommend an even traffic control pattern with equal fractions of 0.25 each week. This evenly spreads the risk and maintains mobility without abrupt restrictions. The sum of fractions is 1, ensuring total flow remains constant."

  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic control policy across all origin states strategically balances epidemic control and mobility preservation by adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions to Oklahoma. States with high infection and exposure counts relative to their populations and significant daily inflows to Oklahoma, such as Texas, Michigan, Ohio, Arkansas, and New Mexico, are assigned strict-first patterns with lower inbound flow fractions in early weeks to minimize early importation of infections, thereby protecting Oklahoma's susceptible population and reducing local transmission risk. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflow volumes adopt even or relaxed-first patterns to sustain economic activity while monitoring epidemic trends. This cross-state differentiation leverages quantitative cooperation by allocating stricter controls temporally when infection pressure is highest, thus flattening the importation curve and preventing healthcare overload. The sum of fractions for each state is rigorously maintained at exactly 1 to keep total inbound flow constant over the four weeks, ensuring no net loss of mobility but temporal redistribution to mitigate risk. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases in any origin state, earlier and stricter controls would be necessary to prevent surges in imported cases. Conversely, declining prevalence would allow more relaxed policies. The approach also acknowledges trade-offs: strict controls reduce early infections but may impact economic ties; relaxed controls preserve mobility but risk seeding outbreaks. Overall, this policy uses data-driven risk assessment and temporal allocation to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Oklahoma while maintaining essential mobility."

The confirmed cases (Q=27369) and deaths (D=1272) indicate some ongoing epidemic burden but overall low prevalence (I/S ratio low). The imported infection risk to Oklahoma from Alabama can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/Population). Given the moderate infection pressure, a 'strict-first' pattern is chosen to reduce inbound flow early when the epidemic in Oklahoma could be most sensitive. This pattern reduces risk in the initial two weeks (f1 and f2 = 0.30 each), relaxing slightly later (f3 and f4) as Oklahoma's control measures and immunity potentially improve. The trade-off balances epidemic control by front-loading restrictions while allowing some mobility recovery later. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.30+0.30+0.20+0.20=1)."

The infection prevalence is moderate but higher than Alabama, warranting more cautious inbound flow early on. The expected imported infections formula Flow*ft*(I/Population) suggests that reducing early weeks traffic lowers initial seeding risks. A 'strict-first' pattern with front-loaded restrictions (35% week 1, 30% week 2) and decreasing fractions later (20%, 15%) is chosen to mitigate early pressure. This approach respects mobility needs with gradual relaxation. The fractions sum to 1 exactly."

  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic control policy for Oklahoma balances epidemic control and mobility across origin states by applying differentiated weekly inbound flow fractions based on infection prevalence, exposed cases, and inflow volumes. States with higher infection pressure (high I and E counts) and moderate inflow are assigned 'strict-first' patterns, frontloading restrictions in the initial weeks to minimize early seeding of infections in Oklahoma. This reduces the initial imported infection load approximately proportional to Flow*ft*(I/Population). Conversely, states with very high inflow but relatively lower infection prevalence adopt even distribution patterns to avoid sudden economic disruption while maintaining steady control. A few states with high infection prevalence but low inflow are assigned 'relaxed-first' patterns to balance epidemic risks and mobility needs, gradually increasing flow after initial control. The weekly fractions for each state sum exactly to 1, preserving total inbound flow over 4 weeks. This cooperation across states helps distribute risk temporally, avoiding simultaneous peaks of imported infections. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates change, the frontloading of restrictions in early weeks can be adjusted to maintain control. The policy also assumes that mobility restrictions effectively reduce imported infections proportional to the traffic fraction. Overall, this strategy minimizes cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Oklahoma by reducing early importation risk and allowing gradual reopening as local immunity and control improve."

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound allocation strategy prioritizes early strict traffic controls for states exhibiting higher infection prevalence, particularly those with elevated infected (I) and exposed (E) populations relative to their susceptible (S) populations. This reduces the initial seeding of infections within Oklahoma, effectively flattening the imported infection curve and curbing secondary transmissions. By distributing lower fractions (stricter controls) in the first and second weeks for high-risk states and gradually relaxing controls in subsequent weeks, the policy balances epidemic control imperatives with economic and social mobility needs. States with lower infection prevalence receive slightly less stringent early controls, reflecting their lower risk of transmitting infection. Quantitatively, imported infections are approximated by Flow * ft * (I / Population), and the chosen patterns minimize this product during the critical early weeks when containment is most effective. Sensitivity considerations reveal that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls would become more beneficial, whereas if these parameters decrease, more balanced or relaxed patterns could be justified. Coordination across states ensures that no single state disproportionately contributes to infection importation in any one week, mitigating risk spikes. This cooperative balancing act maintains the total inbound flow constant over four weeks, preserving mobility while optimizing public health outcomes."

States with lower infection prevalence receive slightly less stringent early controls, reflecting their lower risk of transmitting infection. Quantitatively, imported infections are approximated by Flow * ft * (I / Population), and the chosen patterns minimize this product during the critical early weeks when containment is most effective. Sensitivity considerations reveal that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls would become more beneficial, whereas if these parameters decrease, more balanced or relaxed patterns could be justified. Coordination across states ensures that no single state disproportionately contributes to infection importation in any one week, mitigating risk spikes. This cooperative balancing act maintains the total inbound flow constant over four weeks, preserving mobility while optimizing public health outcomes.'

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations to Oklahoma distribute travel flow over the next 4 weeks to minimize cumulative imported infections and deaths. States with higher infection pressure (large infected and exposed counts relative to population) receive stricter early-week controls (lower fractions in week 1), reflecting the need to reduce initial imported cases when epidemic risk is highest. This strict-first pattern is common among high-risk states such as Arkansas, Idaho, Michigan, New Mexico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin. States with moderate or lower infection pressure adopt relaxed-middle or even patterns, balancing epidemic control with mobility needs. The fractions always sum to 1 per origin state, preserving total inbound flow while adjusting weekly distribution to reduce peak importation risk. This coordinated approach leverages quantitative risk estimation proportional to inbound flow, infection prevalence, and control fraction (imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/population)). By lowering ft in weeks with higher expected risk, cumulative infections and deaths in Oklahoma are minimized. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early-week controls become more critical to prevent surges. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, flow can be more evenly distributed to support economic activity. The cooperation across states ensures that total inbound traffic remains stable, but its temporal distribution adapts to epidemic trends, striking a balance between epidemic control and mobility preservation."

States with higher infection pressure (large infected and exposed counts relative to population) receive stricter early-week controls (lower fractions in week 1), reflecting the need to reduce initial imported cases when epidemic risk is highest. This strict-first pattern is common among high-risk states such as Arkansas, Idaho, Michigan, New Mexico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin. States with moderate or lower infection pressure adopt relaxed-middle or even patterns, balancing epidemic control with mobility needs. The fractions always sum to 1 per origin state, preserving total inbound flow while adjusting weekly distribution to reduce peak importation risk. This coordinated approach leverages quantitative risk estimation proportional to inbound flow, infection prevalence, and control fraction (imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/population)). By lowering ft in weeks with higher expected risk, cumulative infections and deaths in Oklahoma are minimized. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early-week controls become more critical to prevent surges. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, flow can be more evenly distributed to support economic activity. The cooperation across states ensures that total inbound traffic remains stable, but its temporal distribution adapts to epidemic trends, striking a balance between epidemic control and mobility preservation.'
