    "notes": "Alabama's past 28-day data shows a moderate number of infected (I=385) relative to its population (S=4,883,910). The exposed population (E=1306) suggests ongoing transmission. The imported infected can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population), indicating that any relaxation in traffic control increases imported infections proportionally. Alabama's inflow to Wisconsin is moderate (3413 daily). The infection pressure appears stable without strong increasing or decreasing trends, so an even distribution of traffic control (equal fractions) over the 4 weeks balances mobility and epidemic control. Strict-first could be considered if cases were rising, relaxed-first if falling, but neither pattern is strongly supported here. This approach minimizes peaks in imported infections and reduces strain on Wisconsin’s health system while allowing steady mobility. The fractions sum exactly to 1, validating the allocation."

The inbound flow to Wisconsin is 6141 daily, which is significant. To mitigate risk, a strict-first pattern is chosen, applying stricter control early (weeks 3 and 4 have lower fractions). This pattern aims to reduce imported infections upfront when exposure is higher, allowing gradual relaxation later if infection trends improve. The imported infected roughly scale with Flow * ft * (I/population). Arizona's consistent but moderate infection pressure justifies this pattern to balance epidemic control and economic activity.

The daily inflow is 2729, moderate but non-negligible. The relaxed-first pattern is selected to maintain mobility early on while tightening controls in the middle weeks to curb potential rising infections.

A relaxed-first pattern is chosen to allow some mobility early but increase control in later weeks as infection risk persists or grows.

States with higher infection prevalence (I/population) and exposed (E) populations are allocated stricter controls in weeks where infection risk appears higher, often early weeks (strict-first) or late weeks (relaxed-first), depending on infection trend interpretation. This dynamic allocation reduces cumulative imported infections, thereby minimizing confirmed and deceased cases in Wisconsin. Lower fractions in weeks with higher infection pressure reduce imported infected cases, as the expected imported infections scale with Flow * ft * (I/population). States with low and stable infection prevalence use even traffic allocation to maintain economic activity without undue epidemic risk. The cooperation across states allows Wisconsin to distribute control efforts temporally and spatially, preventing overload in any single period and tailoring responses to state-specific epidemic profiles. Sensitivity to beta (transmission rate) and prevalence is key; if infection prevalence or beta increases, stricter and earlier controls may be necessary. Conversely, if prevalence declines, more relaxed patterns can be employed to support mobility. The proposed allocations thus provide a flexible, data-driven approach balancing disease control and economic needs across multiple origin states over four weeks. All traffic fractions per state sum exactly to 1, ensuring consistency and feasibility."

Alabama's inflow to Wisconsin is moderate at 3939 daily average. The infected ratio is low (~0.009%), suggesting that strict traffic control is less necessary. The pattern chosen is even distribution across four weeks to maintain steady mobility and economic activity while keeping imported infection risk stable. Trade-offs include balancing disease control with mobility needs; since infection prevalence is low, strict controls may incur unnecessary socio-economic costs. The four fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.25*4=1). This approach minimizes sudden infection spikes while maintaining flow."

The infection trend and exposure suggest a gradually relaxing pattern: strictest controls in week 1 (0.15), easing over weeks 2 to 4 (0.20, 0.30, 0.35), reflecting a relaxed-first pattern.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic control policies collectively aim to minimize imported infections and subsequent confirmed and deceased cases in Wisconsin. States with higher infection prevalence (e.g., Utah, Arkansas, South Carolina, Idaho, Minnesota) are assigned stricter controls early in the 4-week period (strict-first pattern), reducing initial imported infection pressure when Wisconsin's internal controls are vulnerable. States with lower prevalence or moderate infection levels (e.g., Alabama, Kentucky, Virginia) are allocated even traffic fractions to maintain consistent mobility with balanced risk. Some states with moderate infection but high inflow (e.g., Arizona, Michigan, Ohio, Texas) follow relaxed-first or mixed patterns, allowing gradual easing of controls as Wisconsin strengthens internal response. This cross-state balancing leverages temporal distribution of inbound flows to avoid simultaneous high importation risk, effectively flattening imported infection curves over time. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections per week are proportional to Flow * fraction * (Infected / Susceptible), so concentrating restrictions in weeks when prevalence or flow is higher reduces cumulative risk. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become more critical, while lower prevalence allows more even or relaxed control patterns. The approach balances epidemic control with economic and social mobility, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant over 4 weeks, preserving essential travel and commerce. The fractions for each origin state sum precisely to 1, confirming valid traffic allocation. This strategy aims to optimize Wisconsin's epidemic outcomes by dynamically adjusting inbound traffic restrictions based on origin state infection pressures and mobility baselines."

The risk of importing infected cases is proportional to the inbound flow times the infected proportion, estimated as imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population). Given the moderate infection pressure, a strict-first pattern is employed, imposing stricter controls in the earlier weeks (lower fractions) when Wisconsin's own infected count is still notable, then relaxing controls gradually. This approach helps minimize early importation risk, preventing amplification in Wisconsin.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic policies for Wisconsin collectively aim to minimize imported infections and subsequent deaths by strategically allocating traffic controls over the next four weeks. Across all origin states, we apply stricter controls in the initial weeks when Wisconsin's local infected population remains significant, thereby reducing the risk of seeding new infections from outside. This strict-first pattern is dominant, especially for states with higher infected proportions, to mitigate early imported infection pressure. For states with very large populations but relatively lower infection prevalence, an even traffic allocation pattern is chosen to maintain balanced mobility without sudden spikes in imported cases. The quantitative cooperation logic here involves adjusting weekly fractions so that the total inbound flow remains constant (preserving the ground truth) but redistributing flow to safer periods. By lowering fractions in weeks with higher local or origin infection prevalence and increasing them as risk subsides, we reduce the cumulative imported infection burden. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if the infection prevalence in any origin state were to increase or the transmission rate beta were higher, stricter early controls would be needed to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, if these parameters decrease, more relaxed traffic allocations could be feasible, allowing greater mobility. The balance between epidemic control and social-economic mobility is managed by gradually relaxing controls over the weeks, preventing prolonged restrictions that could cause economic harm. The fractions for each origin state sum exactly to 1.000 to ensure consistency with the total inbound flow constraint, supporting implementable and validated policies."

The strict-first pattern is dominant, concentrating stricter control in the first weeks to sharply reduce initial imported infections, which are roughly proportional to the product of flow fraction and the ratio of infected individuals to total population in origin states. This approach reduces the seeding of new infections in Wisconsin, thereby reducing epidemic growth and mortality. Quantitatively, balancing the traffic fractions so that the sum is exactly 1 for each origin ensures total inbound flow remains constant as required, while redistributing temporal risk. States with relatively higher infection prevalence and inflow (e.g., Michigan, Ohio, Indiana) receive stricter early restrictions; states with lower infection pressure or smaller inflow have relatively more even or slightly less strict control. This cross-state cooperation reduces overall imported infection pressure and prevents overwhelming Wisconsin's healthcare capacity. Sensitivity analysis suggests if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls would be even more critical to prevent exponential growth. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, controls could be more relaxed earlier. The strategy balances epidemic control with economic mobility needs over the 4 weeks, allowing gradual relaxation while preventing resurgence."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended allocations prioritize strict traffic control in the initial weeks for origin states with higher infected and exposed populations, as these constitute the main sources of imported infections to Wisconsin. Since imported infections roughly scale as Flow * fraction * (I/population), front-loading restrictions reduces early seeding of cases, which can exponentially increase local epidemic burden. States with very high inbound flow but relatively lower infection prevalence (e.g., Iowa, Minnesota, Utah) receive even fraction distributions to maintain consistent control without disruptive fluctuations, balancing epidemic control and mobility. This cooperative strategy balances risk, distributing control effort temporally and spatially to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Wisconsin. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence (I) or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early restrictions yield larger benefits; if these decrease, more relaxed patterns may suffice. The approach also balances mobility needs by relaxing controls in later weeks, supporting economic activity while maintaining epidemic control. All fraction sets sum exactly to 1 to preserve total inbound flow, ensuring no net reduction in mobility volume, only temporal redistribution.

Since imported infections roughly scale as Flow * fraction * (I/population), front-loading restrictions reduces early seeding of cases, which can exponentially increase local epidemic burden. States with very high inbound flow but relatively lower infection prevalence (e.g., Iowa, Minnesota, Utah) receive even fraction distributions to maintain consistent control without disruptive fluctuations, balancing epidemic control and mobility. This cooperative strategy balances risk, distributing control effort temporally and spatially to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Wisconsin. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence (I) or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early restrictions yield larger benefits; if these decrease, more relaxed patterns may suffice. The approach also balances mobility needs by relaxing controls in later weeks, supporting economic activity while maintaining epidemic control. All fraction sets sum exactly to 1 to preserve total inbound flow, ensuring no net reduction in mobility volume, only temporal redistribution. This harmonizes epidemic control and mobility demands across multiple origin states effectively.'

  "global_guidance": "The overall inbound traffic control policy for Wisconsin prioritizes reducing imported infections and subsequent deaths by modulating the weekly fractions of inbound flows from each origin state according to their infection prevalence and population sizes. States with higher infection prevalence and large inbound flows, such as Arkansas, Michigan, and Tennessee, receive stricter controls in the first weeks (strict-first pattern) to mitigate early seeding of infections in Wisconsin. States with low infection prevalence but high inbound flows, like Texas, follow an even distribution to maintain consistent control without overly restricting mobility. For states with high infection prevalence but smaller inbound flows, like Utah and Idaho, a relaxed-first pattern is used to balance mobility needs with mid-period control to address incubation risks. This cross-state, cross-week balancing helps spread the control efforts temporally and spatially, preventing concentration of risk and allowing economic activities to persist where safe. The policy design is robust to sensitivity in prevalence and transmission rates; higher beta or prevalence would push for even stricter early controls, while lower values allow more relaxed patterns. The sum of fractions per state is carefully maintained at 1 to preserve total flow volume while flexibly adjusting weekly risk. This cooperative approach minimizes Wisconsin's cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by controlling imported infections effectively while considering socio-economic trade-offs."

    "notes": "Alabama shows moderate infection prevalence with I=882 and E=2843 in a population of about 4.8 million. The infected proportion (I/population) is low (~0.00018), but the exposed count is significant. The expected imported infections can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I/population). Since the baseline daily inbound flow is 2650.36, the total incoming infected individuals per week depends on the fraction ft. The infection pressure appears relatively stable, so an even distribution pattern is chosen to balance epidemic control and mobility needs. Strict early reductions may cause significant disruption without clear additional benefit given the moderate prevalence; thus, keeping traffic steady minimizes socio-economic impact while controlling risks. The fractions sum precisely to 1.000."

The infected proportion is about 0.00023. The baseline inbound flow is relatively high at 16244.5 daily. We expect imported infections ~ Flow * ft * (I/population). Given higher infection prevalence, a strict-first pattern is recommended, with lower fractions in weeks 1 and 2 to reduce initial seeding into Wisconsin, progressively relaxing controls as the local epidemic in Arizona potentially declines or Wisconsin gains herd immunity. This balances epidemic control by reducing immediate risk while allowing more mobility later. Fractions sum to exactly 1.000."

Imported infections scale with Flow * ft * (I/population). Given rising infection levels, a cautious approach is needed. A slightly strict-first pattern is employed by lowering inbound traffic initially to reduce imported infections during high prevalence, then relaxing in weeks 3 and 4. This approach reduces immediate risk to Wisconsin while allowing mobility recovery later. Fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic control policies for Wisconsin collectively aim to minimize imported infections and reduce cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. States with higher infection prevalence and exposed counts, such as Idaho, Utah, Arizona, Minnesota, and Arkansas, are assigned stricter inbound controls in the initial weeks (strict-first pattern) to reduce early seeding of infections into Wisconsin. This approach delays and flattens potential epidemic waves, allowing Wisconsin's health system to manage cases effectively. On the other hand, states with lower infection prevalence or stable epidemiological situations, such as Kentucky, Mississippi, Virginia, and Nebraska, have more relaxed or even traffic allocations to maintain socioeconomic activities without significantly increasing epidemic risk. For states with moderate prevalence and flows, an even distribution balances control and mobility, reducing abrupt disruptions. The quantitative cooperation logic involves balancing traffic reductions across states and weeks such that total inbound flow per origin remains constant but is temporally shifted to minimize high-risk importations early on. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase in origin states, more aggressive early traffic reductions would be warranted to prevent imported infections. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccination rates improve, controls can be relaxed sooner. The patterns chosen reflect current infection dynamics and aim to optimize the trade-off between epidemic control and mobility to minimize Wisconsin's epidemic burden while considering economic and social factors. All fractions for each origin state sum exactly to 1, ensuring consistency with total inbound flow constraints."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic control policies are designed to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Wisconsin by strategically adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions for each origin state while keeping total 4-week inflow constant. States with higher infection prevalence and large inflow, like Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio, and Texas, have stricter controls in initial weeks (lower fractions) with gradual relaxation. This staggered approach reduces importation pressure when Wisconsin's local infections may be vulnerable to surges, thereby flattening the curve and lowering deaths. States with low infected numbers or small inflow have even allocations to preserve mobility and economic activity without posing significant risk. The pattern choices (strict-first or relaxed-first) rely on infection trends and inflow magnitude, balancing epidemic control and mobility trade-offs. The coordination across states distributes importation risks over time, preventing concentrated spikes that could overwhelm Wisconsin's healthcare. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases in any origin state, stricter early-week controls should be intensified. Conversely, if prevalence drops or beta decreases, allocations can shift toward more relaxed controls. Overall, this policy framework optimizes Wisconsin's epidemic control by leveraging granular origin state infection data and inflow patterns, enhancing public health outcomes while maintaining essential mobility."

  "global_guidance": "The traffic control policy across all origin states to Wisconsin aims to minimize imported infections and deaths by strategically allocating the inbound flow fractions over the next four weeks. States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to their susceptible counts, such as South Carolina, Michigan, Alabama, and Tennessee, adopt a strict-first pattern, reducing inbound flow fractions in the initial weeks and gradually relaxing controls. This prevents early seeding of infections in Wisconsin when the state is vulnerable. Conversely, states with lower infection pressures or stable trends, like Iowa, Nebraska, and Texas, apply an even or relaxed-first pattern to balance epidemic control with economic and social mobility demands. The quantitative logic underpinning this strategy estimates imported infections as proportional to the daily inbound flow multiplied by the fraction for the week and the infected proportion (I/population) of the origin state. By varying the weekly fractions while keeping total flow constant, the policy distributes risk over time, reducing peak importation risk and enabling adaptive responses. Cross-state cooperation is implicit, as stricter controls on high-risk origins allow more relaxed policies on lower-risk states, collectively reducing Wisconsin's epidemic pressure. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter and more front-loaded controls would be necessary to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, lower risk profiles allow for more balanced mobility. The fractions for each origin state sum exactly to 1, ensuring that the total inbound flow remains consistent with ground truth data, preserving overall mobility volumes while optimizing timing to minimize epidemic impact."

The infected prevalence is about 0.0095%, and exposed about 0.031%, which is relatively low but non-negligible. The imported infected cases roughly scale as Flow * ft * (I / Population). Given that the inflow is moderate (3939 daily), reducing inbound traffic early can help prevent imported infections from seeding further spread in Wisconsin. We adopt a strict-first pattern, allocating lower fractions in week 1 (0.40) and decreasing further in subsequent weeks, reflecting a cautious approach to immediately restrict traffic to reduce imported infection risk. This approach balances epidemic control by front-loading restrictions while allowing gradual relaxation as the epidemic stabilizes. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy for Wisconsin focuses on minimizing imported infections from all origin states by front-loading stricter controls in the initial weeks, following a strict-first traffic allocation pattern. This is justified by the epidemiological principle that early reduction of imported infections can prevent seeding of new cases within Wisconsin, thereby reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. The infected prevalence (I/population) and exposed prevalence (E/population) provide a proxy for infectious pressure from each origin state. Since imported infected cases are approximately proportional to the product of inbound flow, fraction of traffic allowed (ft), and infected prevalence, decreasing ft in early weeks effectively lowers imported infections. The allocation of inbound fractions collectively sums to 1 for each state, ensuring total flow remains constant over 4 weeks, but reshaped to reduce risk when infection pressure is highest. States with higher infected prevalence and/or high inflow have stricter early restrictions (lower ft in week 1), while those with lower prevalence or smaller flows have moderate but still front-loaded restrictions. This balanced approach manages epidemic risk while acknowledging the economic and social costs of mobility restrictions. Sensitivity analyses reveal that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early restrictions become even more critical to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or control measures improve, the strictness could be relaxed earlier. The cooperation across states in timing restrictions helps smooth imported infection risk, preventing simultaneous high influx from multiple states in the same period. This temporal distribution of traffic reduces the likelihood of overwhelming local health resources.

This is justified by the epidemiological principle that early reduction of imported infections can prevent seeding of new cases within Wisconsin, thereby reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. The infected prevalence (I/population) and exposed prevalence (E/population) provide a proxy for infectious pressure from each origin state. Since imported infected cases are approximately proportional to the product of inbound flow, fraction of traffic allowed (ft), and infected prevalence, decreasing ft in early weeks effectively lowers imported infections. The allocation of inbound fractions collectively sums to 1 for each state, ensuring total flow remains constant over 4 weeks, but reshaped to reduce risk when infection pressure is highest. States with higher infected prevalence and/or high inflow have stricter early restrictions (lower ft in week 1), while those with lower prevalence or smaller flows have moderate but still front-loaded restrictions. This balanced approach manages epidemic risk while acknowledging the economic and social costs of mobility restrictions. Sensitivity analyses reveal that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early restrictions become even more critical to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or control measures improve, the strictness could be relaxed earlier. The cooperation across states in timing restrictions helps smooth imported infection risk, preventing simultaneous high influx from multiple states in the same period. This temporal distribution of traffic reduces the likelihood of overwhelming local health resources. Overall, the strict-first pattern aligns with Wisconsin's goal to minimize cumulative cases and deaths by strategically controlling inbound traffic based on origin state epidemiological risk and flow volume."

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy balances epidemic control and mobility by adjusting traffic fractions week-by-week per origin state based on infection prevalence and inflow magnitude. States with higher infection prevalence and large inflow to Wisconsin (e.g., Minnesota, Arkansas, Michigan) receive stricter controls in early weeks (strict-first pattern) to reduce early imported infections that could amplify Wisconsin's epidemic. States with moderate infection levels but significant inflow (e.g., Arizona, Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee) follow relaxed-first patterns, allowing some initial mobility but ramping up control to prevent uncontrolled spread. States with low infection prevalence or low inflow maintain even traffic allocations to balance economic and social needs without risking outbreak surges. The imported infected cases are approximately proportional to inflow * fraction * (I / population of origin). By distributing traffic fractions to reduce weekly imported infections, cumulative cases and deaths in Wisconsin are minimized. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls or lower fractions in initial weeks would be warranted. Conversely, if prevalence or beta decreases, more relaxed allocations can be safely adopted. The cooperation across states ensures that traffic is not concentrated in any single week, preventing spikes in imported infections and allowing Wisconsin's healthcare system to manage cases effectively. This coordinated approach optimizes epidemic control while preserving necessary mobility and economic activities."

The imported infected cases roughly scale with Flow*ft*(I/S). Given the inflow and disease prevalence, early weeks require stricter control to minimize initial seeding of infections in Wisconsin. Thus, a strict-first pattern is adopted with decreasing control over the four weeks (fractions sum to 1).

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic control policies prioritize early strict control (strict-first pattern) for most states with moderate to high infection prevalence to minimize initial importation of infected individuals into Wisconsin. This front-loaded control reduces the seeding of new infections, lowering cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. States with very large susceptible populations and stable infection rates, like Arizona, Michigan, and Texas, adopt an even allocation pattern to maintain steady mobility while controlling risk. The total inbound flow per origin state remains constant over four weeks, but weekly fractions are adjusted to balance epidemic risk and mobility needs, preventing spikes in imported infections. Quantitatively, the expected number of imported infected individuals scales approximately as Flow*ft*(I/S), so reducing ft in high prevalence weeks minimizes imported infections. This cooperative strategy across all origin states distributes the burden of control, preventing overwhelming restrictions on any single state or week. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence (I/S) increases or transmission rate (beta) rises, stricter early controls become more critical to avert outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccination/immunity increases, controls may relax sooner. The approach balances epidemic control with social and economic mobility, aiming to minimize Wisconsin's epidemic burden while accommodating essential movement. All fractions strictly sum to 1 per origin state, ensuring total inbound flow consistency and policy feasibility."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policy for Wisconsin prioritizes minimizing imported infections and deaths by front-loading stricter controls (lower fractions) in the initial weeks, then gradually relaxing them. This strict-first pattern is chosen because early weeks pose the highest risk for seeding infections due to the presence of exposed and infected individuals in origin states. By reducing inbound flow early, Wisconsin limits the initial imported infection pressure, which is critical as the local epidemic still has active infections (I=5666) and exposed individuals (E=7158). The cumulative imported infected cases are modeled approximately as Flow * ft * (I / total population), so adjusting ft impacts weekly imported infection load while keeping the total flow constant. This allocation balances epidemic control and mobility by allowing some relaxation over time, which supports economic activity and mobility needs. Across states, flows from those with higher infected or exposed prevalence and large inflows (e.g., Michigan, Minnesota, Indiana, Arizona) have stronger front-loaded restrictions to reduce infection seeding risk; states with lower prevalence or inflow have more moderate control. This quantitative cooperation helps to distribute risk reduction efforts effectively, preventing overwhelming importation from any single source. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence (I or E) or transmission parameters (beta) increase, the benefit of strict-first controls intensifies, as early importation risk rises. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, controls could be relaxed sooner to favor mobility. Overall, this policy aims to minimize Wisconsin’s cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically managing inbound traffic based on origin state epidemiology and flow volumes, ensuring total inbound volumes remain constant while optimizing timing of restrictions."

    "notes": "Alabama shows a moderate exposed (E=2585) and infected (I=800) population relative to its susceptible population (S=4816265). The expected imported infections can be approximated by inflow * fraction * (I / population), thus higher infected proportion or higher flow increases risk. Alabama's inflow to Wisconsin is moderate (avg daily 2877.86). Given relatively stable infection levels, a strict-first pattern is chosen to reduce early risk when cases are higher, allowing gradual relaxation as weeks progress. This balances epidemic control by front-loading restrictions to prevent seeding new cases in Wisconsin, while permitting some mobility later to reduce societal and economic burdens. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000, validating allocation."

With an inflow of about 12001.29 daily, the infected contribution to Wisconsin's epidemic is non-negligible. The fractions reflect a slight strict-first pattern with lower fraction in week 1 to curtail early importation, then gradually relaxing controls as the infected proportion stabilizes. This pattern reduces early pressure on Wisconsin's health system while allowing some mobility recovery later. Trade-offs between controlling spread and economic activity are balanced by not overly restricting later weeks. The fractions sum to 1.000, ensuring consistent flow allocation."

With a daily inflow of about 3042.71, the risk of importing infections is moderate.

States with high infected (I) and exposed (E) populations combined with large daily inflows, such as Minnesota, Michigan, Indiana, and Arizona, are assigned more restrictive inbound fractions in the early weeks to reduce immediate importation risks of infections. This 'strict-first' or 'relaxed-first' pattern is selected based on infection prevalence trends, balancing the need to suppress early seeding events against maintaining essential mobility and economic activity. Conversely, states with lower infected proportions or smaller inflows tend to have more even distributions, avoiding unnecessary severe restrictions that could burden mobility without significant epidemic benefit. The cumulative inbound flows remain constant over the 4 weeks for each origin state, preserving total mobility but redistributing it to minimize epidemic pressure peaks. This temporal balancing acts as a form of quantitative cooperation, where collective early reductions in high-risk weeks reduce transmission chains and subsequent cases and deaths downstream in Wisconsin. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) were higher, more stringent early restrictions would be beneficial, whereas lower prevalence or beta might allow more uniform or relaxed allocations. The approach is robust to moderate parameter fluctuations, relying on infection prevalence and flow volumes as primary drivers. The strategy carefully weighs trade-offs between epidemic suppression and maintaining socio-economic functions by modulating restrictions over time and across states, ensuring the total inbound flow per origin state sums exactly to one, thus conserving baseline mobility while maximizing public health safety."

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy prioritizes minimizing early imported infections into Wisconsin, where the current infected and exposed populations remain significant. By applying stricter controls in the first two weeks (strict-first pattern) for high-risk origin states, we reduce the initial infection pressure on Wisconsin's healthcare system during its vulnerable epidemic phase. For states with lower infection prevalence or very large populations (e.g., Texas, Minnesota), more even or relaxed-first patterns are used to maintain mobility while managing risk. The quantitative logic relies on the approximation of imported infections as Flow * ft * (I/S), where higher infection prevalence or flow leads to more stringent early restrictions. Balancing traffic control across states and weeks spreads risk temporally and spatially, preventing surges in imported infections. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become even more critical to prevent exponential growth in Wisconsin. Conversely, if prevalence drops or beta decreases, traffic can be more evenly distributed to support economic activity.

By applying stricter controls in the first two weeks (strict-first pattern) for high-risk origin states, we reduce the initial infection pressure on Wisconsin's healthcare system during its vulnerable epidemic phase. For states with lower infection prevalence or very large populations (e.g., Texas, Minnesota), more even or relaxed-first patterns are used to maintain mobility while managing risk. The quantitative logic relies on the approximation of imported infections as Flow * ft * (I/S), where higher infection prevalence or flow leads to more stringent early restrictions. Balancing traffic control across states and weeks spreads risk temporally and spatially, preventing surges in imported infections. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become even more critical to prevent exponential growth in Wisconsin. Conversely, if prevalence drops or beta decreases, traffic can be more evenly distributed to support economic activity. This cooperative allocation across multiple origin states ensures that Wisconsin's cumulative confirmed and deceased cases are minimized while sustaining essential mobility, with all weekly fractions for each state summing exactly to 1.000 for consistency and operational feasibility."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Wisconsin, the inbound traffic allocations across origin states are designed to strategically balance epidemic control and mobility. States with higher infection and exposure prevalence, such as Idaho, Utah, and Arizona, receive patterns that reduce inflow in the initial or final weeks to avoid peak importation risks. Strict-first patterns are applied especially for states with higher infected counts and larger inflows, reducing traffic in later weeks when cumulative imported infections compound Wisconsin's epidemic burden. Conversely, states with lower infection rates or smaller inflows have even distributions or relaxed-first patterns that allow more mobility early or late, supporting economic activity while managing risk. The quantitative cooperation logic entails adjusting the fractions so that weekly imported infections, estimated by Flow * ft * (I/population), are balanced across time and origin states to prevent spikes that could overwhelm Wisconsin's healthcare capacity or drive epidemic resurgence. This approach collectively reduces the expected number of imported infections and deaths by smoothing traffic flow and tightening controls when infection pressure is higher. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase in any origin state, stricter controls (lower ft) should be assigned to weeks with higher inflow to mitigate risk. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed fractions may be permitted to support mobility. The allocations also consider Wisconsin's current epidemic state, ensuring inbound flows do not exacerbate local transmission significantly. Overall, these traffic control policies represent a coordinated and dynamic strategy to minimize epidemic impact while preserving essential mobility and economic functions."
