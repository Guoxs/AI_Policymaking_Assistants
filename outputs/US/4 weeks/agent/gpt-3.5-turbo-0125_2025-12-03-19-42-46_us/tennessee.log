This suggests a controlled outbreak with significant detection and isolation. The imported infections into Tennessee from Alabama can be approximated by Flow * ft * (I / total population); given the moderate infected proportion, an even allocation pattern is chosen to balance mobility and control across 4 weeks. Strict-first or relaxed-first patterns are less suitable since infection pressure is relatively stable. The trade-off is allowing consistent mobility to maintain economic activity while not increasing risk suddenly. The fractions sum to exactly 1 (0.25*4=1)."

The infected proportion is moderate but slightly increasing, suggesting a relaxed-first pattern to allow some easing in later weeks while tightening controls initially to prevent early imported cases.

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocation strategy for Tennessee carefully balances epidemic control and mobility by adjusting weekly proportions for each origin state to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. Across states, the approach leverages infection prevalence metrics (I, E) relative to population sizes to estimate expected imported infections as Flow * ft * (I / population). States with high or rising infection pressure (e.g., South Carolina, Michigan, Idaho) adopt a strict-first pattern—restricting inbound flow more heavily in early weeks to reduce initial seeding risk, then relaxing controls later as cases stabilize or decline. Conversely, states with low or stable infection pressure (e.g., Alabama, Tennessee's neighbors with low I) use even or relaxed-first patterns to maintain economic activity without significantly increasing risk. This temporal modulation exploits the disease progression dynamic (exposed converting to infected) to prevent compounding imported cases. By ensuring the total 4-week inbound flow remains constant per state, the approach respects mobility baselines while optimizing timing of restrictions to blunt infection importation peaks. Sensitivity to epidemic parameters (e.g., beta, alpha) and prevalence is integral; increases in transmission or prevalence would justify more stringent early controls, while improvements could enable earlier relaxation. This state-by-state allocation also balances risk across the network, preventing bottlenecks and unintended spillovers. Overall, this nuanced, data-driven inbound traffic control framework strategically reduces imported infections and deaths in Tennessee while sustaining essential mobility."

Considering the population size, the infection prevalence (I/pop) is low (~0.00009). The expected imported infections per week are proportional to Flow*ft*(I/pop). Alabama's inflow is high (~152,234 daily avg). We choose a relaxed-first pattern, allocating increasing fractions over weeks (0.20,0.25,0.30,0.25), to initially impose stricter control to reduce imported infected cases given the non-negligible inflow and moderate infection levels, then gradually relax. The trade-off balances epidemic control early to avoid seeding cases in Tennessee, with mobility needs later. The sum of fractions is exactly 1.0, validating the allocation."

Given this, a relaxed-first pattern with low initial fractions (0.10) and increasing to 0.40 is prudent to minimize early imported risks while allowing mobility later.

States with higher infection prevalence and large inflows receive stricter early week controls (lower fractions), delaying mobility to reduce seeding risk. Conversely, states with low infection rates or small flows maintain even or slightly relaxed-first patterns, preserving mobility without risking resurgence. The total 4-week inbound traffic volume per state remains constant, only weekly distribution changes, ensuring fairness in mobility allocation while optimizing epidemic control. This cooperative approach manages risk by temporally shifting travel demand, smoothing importation pressure. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter front-loading of control fractions would be necessary to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more even or relaxed patterns could be adopted to support economic activity. Overall, this strategy aligns with epidemic dynamics and mobility needs to protect Tennessee's population from imported COVID-19 spread efficiently."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic control policy across all origin states aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Tennessee by strategically allocating inbound flows over the next four weeks. States with higher infection prevalence (I) and/or large daily inflows to Tennessee receive stricter controls early in the period (strict-first pattern), reducing the initial imported infection pressure substantially. The logic follows the approximate formula: imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), where reducing ft in early weeks lowers imported infections. This front-loading of restrictions allows Tennessee's healthcare system time to adapt and limits early epidemic amplification. Conversely, states with low infection prevalence and/or low inflow receive even distributions of traffic to maintain mobility while controlling risk. This balanced approach ensures that total inbound flow over the four weeks remains constant (fractions summing exactly to 1), preserving economic activity and travel needs. Quantitative cooperation logic involves distributing restrictions temporally and spatially: restricting high-risk states early while relaxing low-risk or low-flow states evenly. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase in any origin state, stricter early restrictions should be intensified to prevent surges. Conversely, if these parameters decrease, more uniform or relaxed policies may be feasible.

States with higher infection prevalence (I) and/or large daily inflows to Tennessee receive stricter controls early in the period (strict-first pattern), reducing the initial imported infection pressure substantially. The logic follows the approximate formula: imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), where reducing ft in early weeks lowers imported infections. This front-loading of restrictions allows Tennessee's healthcare system time to adapt and limits early epidemic amplification. Conversely, states with low infection prevalence and/or low inflow receive even distributions of traffic to maintain mobility while controlling risk. This balanced approach ensures that total inbound flow over the four weeks remains constant (fractions summing exactly to 1), preserving economic activity and travel needs. Quantitative cooperation logic involves distributing restrictions temporally and spatially: restricting high-risk states early while relaxing low-risk or low-flow states evenly. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase in any origin state, stricter early restrictions should be intensified to prevent surges. Conversely, if these parameters decrease, more uniform or relaxed policies may be feasible. This dynamic allocation approach mitigates imported cases' risk while allowing gradual normalization of traffic, effectively balancing epidemic control and mobility needs."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Tennessee, the traffic control policy adjusts inbound flow fractions weekly to reduce early importation of infections from high-risk origin states. States with high infection prevalence (high I and E relative to population) and large inflow volumes, such as Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Texas, Ohio, Michigan, and Virginia, adopt a strict-first pattern that front-loads stricter traffic restrictions in the initial weeks. This minimizes early seeding events which can exponentially increase local transmission in Tennessee. For states with moderate infection levels or smaller inflow volumes, an even or relaxed-first pattern is chosen to balance epidemic control and mobility needs, avoiding overly stringent restrictions that may cause economic or social disruption. The expected imported infections are roughly proportional to the product of daily inflow, weekly fraction, and the infected proportion in the origin population (Flow * ft * (I/population)). By varying ft across weeks but keeping total flow constant, the policy strategically delays or reduces peak infection importation pressure. This weekly balancing across states also prevents synchronized importation surges, smoothing epidemic risk over the 4-week horizon. The policy is robust to sensitivity in prevalence estimates or transmission rates (beta); higher beta or prevalence would favor stricter early-week controls especially for states with large inflow. Conversely, if prevalence declines, the policy can relax correspondingly. Overall, this coordinated staggered control across multiple origin states and weeks effectively minimizes introduction of new cases while preserving essential mobility, thereby reducing cumulative cases and deaths in Tennessee."

    "notes": "Alabama has a moderately high susceptible population (4.8 million) with relatively low exposed (2398) and infected (742) numbers. The confirmed cases (23915) and deaths (1075) indicate moderate epidemic pressure. The incoming flow is significant at 112,997.5 daily. Imported infections can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/Population), so balancing inflow evenly reduces risk spikes. Alabama's infection prevalence is relatively stable, thus an even pattern for the 4 weeks is chosen to maintain consistent control. This avoids overwhelming Tennessee's healthcare capacity with sudden surges while maintaining mobility. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

Confirmed cases are quite high at 107,520, with 5,875 deaths, indicating substantial infection pressure. The inbound flow is lower (7030 daily), but risk per traveler is higher. Imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/Pop). A relaxed-first pattern is chosen here to delay higher inflow to weeks 3 and 4, allowing Tennessee to prepare for possible surges and spread out risk. Trade-offs favor stricter early controls with slightly relaxed later weeks as the epidemic possibly stabilizes or improves. Fractions sum to 1.000."

Confirmed cases (6294) and deaths (1202) suggest moderate ongoing infections. The daily inbound flow is substantial at 36,370. Imported infections depend on Flow*ft*(I/Pop), so front-loading stricter control (lower fractions) in weeks 3 and 4 helps reduce peak risk as infections might rise. A strict-first pattern is selected to curb early transmission to Tennessee. This balances mobility by allowing more flow in early weeks when infection risk may be lower. The fractions sum to 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "The traffic control policy collectively balances epidemic risk and mobility across all origin states by adjusting weekly inflow fractions to Tennessee. States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to their susceptible population and significant daily inflows, such as Utah, Arizona, Michigan, and Texas, adopt a relaxed-first pattern, delaying increased inflow to weeks 3 and 4. This allows Tennessee to prepare and manage potential surges, reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. States with moderate infection prevalence and large inflow, like Alabama, Indiana, Ohio, South Carolina, Kentucky, and Wisconsin, use an even pattern to spread risk evenly over the 4 weeks, smoothing imported infection pressure and maintaining consistent mobility. States with moderate to high infection pressure but smaller inflows, such as Arkansas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Nebraska, apply strict-first patterns, reducing inflow in later weeks to prevent late surges and allowing more mobility early on. This diversified approach distributes risk temporally and spatially, preventing simultaneous peaks and overwhelming healthcare capacity. Quantitatively, imported infections scale as Flow*ft*(I/Population), so adjusting ft values modulates infection import risk without changing total inflow. This cooperation logic balances states’ epidemic profiles and mobility contributions, optimizing Tennessee's epidemic control. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls (lower initial fractions) would be more beneficial to dampen infections early. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta reduces due to interventions, more relaxed controls can be applied sooner. The policy is robust to moderate parameter shifts, emphasizing flexible temporal allocation over total flow reduction to maintain economic and social activity while minimizing health impacts."

The risk of importing infected individuals is proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population). Given the large average inflow (85818.82 daily) and moderate infection prevalence, a balanced but cautious approach is needed. We choose a slight strict-first pattern to reduce early imported infections, gradually relaxing control in the middle weeks when Tennessee's own epidemic state might be more stable. This pattern helps mitigate early spikes that could amplify local transmission. Trade-offs involve restricting mobility initially to lower early importation but allowing gradual return to normalcy to minimize economic and social disruption. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000, validating the allocation."

The average inflow is small (6375.46 daily), so the absolute number of imported infections is limited. We use an even allocation to maintain consistent control and avoid abrupt changes that might disrupt mobility unnecessarily. The imported infected count is roughly Flow*ft*(I/population), and even fractions ensure steady, manageable inflow. This balances epidemic control and mobility with minimal risk.

We apply a strict-first pattern with low fractions in week 1 (0.18) to sharply reduce early imported infections, relaxing somewhat in weeks 2 and 3 (0.32, 0.30), then tightening again in week 4.

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocations prioritize early strict control for states with high infected counts and/or large inbound flows to Tennessee to minimize initial importation of infectious individuals. This early reduction is crucial as imported infections can seed further local spread, increasing confirmed and deceased cases. States with low absolute inflow or low infected prevalence allow more relaxed or even traffic patterns, balancing epidemic control and economic mobility. The fractions are adjusted weekly to create a traffic control pattern that is mostly strict-first or slight strict-first to blunt early epidemic seeding, followed by gradual relaxation to support economic recovery. This staggered approach spreads the mobility impact across weeks and states, reducing peak importation risk while avoiding sudden mobility shocks. The imported infections relate quantitatively to the product of daily inflow, fraction of allowed flow, and the infected prevalence in the origin state (Flow*ft*(I/population)). Adjusting fractions weekly allows temporal risk balancing, lowering the probability of spikes in imported cases. This cooperative strategy across states leverages varying epidemic burdens and mobility volumes to optimize overall risk to Tennessee. Sensitivity analysis shows that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls would be needed to compensate for higher importation risk. Conversely, if prevalence drops or immunity rises, fractions can be relaxed earlier. This dynamic policy framework is robust to such changes by adjusting weekly fractions accordingly. The sum of fractions per state is strictly maintained at 1 to preserve total flow and avoid unintended reductions in overall mobility volume, ensuring fairness and predictability. This coordinated, evidence-based policy supports Tennessee's goal to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by optimally managing inbound traffic from all origin states."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively minimize imported infections and subsequent cases and deaths in Tennessee, the allocations prioritize stricter traffic controls in the early weeks (strict-first pattern) for states exhibiting higher infection prevalence or active infections, such as Arkansas, Alabama, Indiana, Ohio, and Virginia. This early strict control reduces the immediate seeding risk, which is critical given Tennessee's current susceptible population and ongoing epidemic levels. States with very high exposed and infected counts (Idaho, Utah) adopt a relaxed-first pattern to delay inflows when risk might be highest while accommodating mobility needs later. Several states with moderate infection levels use even traffic distribution to maintain steady control and minimize abrupt changes, which can aid compliance and planning. The total flow from each origin is conserved (fractions sum to exactly 1), ensuring no reduction in overall mobility volume but temporal redistribution to flatten importation risk peaks. Cross-state coordination ensures that weeks with generally higher Tennessee vulnerability (early weeks with rising cases) coincide with stricter inbound controls from higher-risk states, effectively reducing cumulative imported infections and deaths. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more critical to prevent exponential growth. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccination progresses, more relaxed and even traffic distributions could be appropriate. This policy balances epidemic control with economic and social mobility, aiming for sustainable long-term mitigation."

Given the large average past 28-day inflow (11,8771 daily), the risk of importing infections into Tennessee is significant. The expected imported infections can be approximated as imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population), thus reducing flow fractions in earlier weeks lowers early importation risk. We adopt a strict-first pattern (higher restrictions in weeks 1 and 2) to minimize early introduction of cases. This balances epidemic control with mobility by gradually relaxing controls as Tennessee's local epidemic presumably stabilizes. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

States with high infection prevalence (I) and/or large average inbound flows receive stricter controls in the initial weeks (strict-first pattern), reducing early importation of infectious individuals. This approach leverages the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population), emphasizing that early reductions in fraction ft can significantly cut early seeding events which drive epidemic growth in Tennessee. For states with low infection prevalence or low inflow, even or slightly strict-first patterns are chosen to maintain balance between epidemic control and mobility needs. Collectively, these allocations reduce expected imported infections during critical early weeks, allowing Tennessee's local control measures to be more effective. The gradual relaxation of controls over weeks 3 and 4 supports economic activity and mobility without substantially increasing importation risk. Quantitatively, the cooperation across states balances importation risk temporally and spatially, smoothing flow to avoid surges in cases. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence (I) or transmission rate (beta) increase in origin states, stricter early restrictions would be warranted. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed patterns could be implemented to enhance mobility. These policies are robust to moderate parameter changes but should be updated as epidemic conditions evolve. All fraction arrays sum exactly to one, ensuring consistent total inbound flow per origin state. This careful tailoring of inbound traffic control balances epidemic suppression with vital mobility and economic considerations for Tennessee."

The expected imported infected cases are approximately Flow * ft * (I / population). Since Alabama has a large inflow (152234.68 daily average) to Tennessee, balancing traffic evenly over the four weeks (even pattern) mitigates sudden spikes in importation of infections. A strict-first or relaxed-first approach is less optimal here since Alabama's infection prevalence is stable, not showing clear increasing or decreasing trends. The even pattern balances epidemic control and mobility by avoiding abrupt restrictions that could hurt mobility or cause rebound infections later. The fractions sum to exactly 1.0, validating compliance."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocation strategy for Tennessee carefully balances epidemic control and mobility across 19 origin states. States with higher infection prevalence relative to population or large inflow volumes are managed with patterns that either evenly distribute traffic or emphasize stricter controls in weeks with expected higher infection pressure. For example, states like Alabama and Kentucky with large inflows and moderate infection rates use even or relaxed-first patterns to avoid spikes and support economic activity. In contrast, states with higher infected prevalence and smaller inflows, such as Idaho, Utah, and Nebraska, apply strict-first patterns reducing traffic in later weeks to mitigate risk of increasing infections. The expected imported infections from each origin state scale roughly as Flow * ft * (I/population), so adjusting the weekly fractions ft helps flatten infection importation curves and prevents overwhelming Tennessee's healthcare capacity. Collectively, this coordinated approach minimizes cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by smoothing imported infection risk over time and across states. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter controls in later weeks will become more beneficial to prevent case surges. Conversely, lower prevalence allows more relaxed patterns supporting mobility without compromising epidemic control. The strategy maintains the total inbound flow constant per origin state, preserving economic ties while reducing epidemic risk through temporal redistribution of traffic. This cooperative cross-state mobility control approach is essential to balancing health and economic objectives for Tennessee in the coming month."

  "global_guidance": "The collective allocation of inbound traffic fractions across the origin states is designed to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Tennessee by strategically balancing epidemic control and mobility. States with higher infected (I) and exposed (E) proportions relative to their susceptible populations receive traffic patterns that impose stricter control in early or later weeks, depending on infection pressure trends, to reduce imported infections effectively. For instance, states like Arkansas, New Mexico, and Texas with relatively high infection prevalence adopt strict-first strategies, reducing traffic flow in critical periods to limit infection importation peaks. Conversely, states with stable or lower infection levels (e.g., Alabama, Iowa, Minnesota) apply even traffic patterns to maintain a balance between control and mobility. The quantitative cooperation logic hinges on the approximation that imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/population), thus weekly fractions modulate the risk dynamically. Distributing strict controls across different weeks and states avoids overburdening any particular period or source, achieving a collective reduction in infection pressure on Tennessee. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter controls or more pronounced strict-first patterns would be necessary to prevent surges. Conversely, if prevalence declines, more relaxed patterns can be safely adopted. This flexible yet rigorously balanced strategy ensures Tennessee manages inbound flows to minimize epidemic impact while preserving essential mobility and economic activities."

  "global_guidance": "The overall traffic control policy aims to minimize imported infections and deaths in Tennessee by strategically allocating inbound flows over the next four weeks from all origin states.

This balances the trade-offs between epidemic control and mobility needs. Even patterns are chosen for states with moderate prevalence and large inflow to maintain stable mobility without increasing epidemic risk. Strict-first patterns are applied where infection prevalence or risk is expected to increase, imposing stricter controls in later weeks to reduce importation. Relaxed-first patterns allow higher inflow initially but tighten control later to mitigate risks as infections potentially rise. This dynamic allocation leverages temporal flexibility to reduce cumulative cases and deaths by preventing sudden spikes in imported infections while allowing mobility to sustain economic and social activities. The 4-week fractions for each state sum exactly to 1, ensuring total inflow remains consistent with ground truth. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter controls earlier may be needed, while if prevalence decreases, more relaxed patterns could be adopted.

The imported infected cases scale with the flow and the infected prevalence ratio I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D). With a large average daily inflow (100,783.5), imported infections could be significant. Given stable infection levels and no evident trend of increasing or decreasing prevalence, an even distribution of traffic control (even pattern) over the 4 weeks balances epidemic control with mobility needs.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocation policies for Tennessee collectively aim to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by adjusting weekly travel fractions from each origin state based on their infection prevalence and average daily inflow. States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to their susceptible population and significant average inflows are subject to stricter control during vulnerable periods for Tennessee (early or late weeks), implemented via strict-first or strict-last patterns. This approach reduces the number of imported infected individuals, which can seed new infections and exacerbate the local epidemic. For states with lower infection prevalence or low inflow, even traffic distribution over the four weeks balances the need for epidemic control with mobility and economic considerations. The quantitative logic behind this policy is that imported infected cases roughly scale with the product of the average inflow, the weekly fraction, and the infected prevalence (I/(total population)). By modulating the fractions over weeks, the policy shifts travel to periods when Tennessee is less vulnerable or infection pressure is lower, effectively flattening importation peaks and reducing transmission risk. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter control patterns (lower fractions) may be warranted for more weeks or origins to prevent surges. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed patterns could be adopted to restore mobility. The cooperative balancing of traffic flows across states and weeks ensures that the total inbound volume remains constant, preserving travel demand while strategically mitigating epidemic risk. The sum of fractions for each state is exactly 1, ensuring the total inbound flow over 4 weeks is unchanged, complying with constraints."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocation strategy for Tennessee is designed to collectively reduce the expected imported infections and deaths by strategically modulating weekly inflows from each origin state based on their infection prevalence and flow magnitude. States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to their susceptible base, and those with large average daily inflows, are assigned stricter controls in the initial weeks (strict-first pattern) to curtail seeding of infection early on. This reduces cumulative transmission and mortality risks within Tennessee. Conversely, states with moderate or lower infection prevalence can tolerate more balanced or relaxed controls earlier to maintain economic mobility while still managing risk. The weekly fractions sum to exactly one for each state, ensuring the total inbound flow over 4 weeks remains constant per ground truth data, thereby preserving baseline mobility volumes but redistributing them temporally. This temporal redistribution helps flatten the importation curve, allowing Tennessee's health system to better absorb and respond to new cases. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter and more front-loaded controls would be warranted to minimize imported cases. Conversely, if prevalence declines, allocations could shift toward more relaxed patterns to facilitate mobility. Coordination across states is essential; high-risk states are controlled more stringently early, while low-risk states contribute to sustained but controlled mobility.

States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to their susceptible base, and those with large average daily inflows, are assigned stricter controls in the initial weeks (strict-first pattern) to curtail seeding of infection early on. This reduces cumulative transmission and mortality risks within Tennessee. Conversely, states with moderate or lower infection prevalence can tolerate more balanced or relaxed controls earlier to maintain economic mobility while still managing risk. The weekly fractions sum to exactly one for each state, ensuring the total inbound flow over 4 weeks remains constant per ground truth data, thereby preserving baseline mobility volumes but redistributing them temporally. This temporal redistribution helps flatten the importation curve, allowing Tennessee's health system to better absorb and respond to new cases. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter and more front-loaded controls would be warranted to minimize imported cases. Conversely, if prevalence declines, allocations could shift toward more relaxed patterns to facilitate mobility. Coordination across states is essential; high-risk states are controlled more stringently early, while low-risk states contribute to sustained but controlled mobility. This cooperative policy balances epidemic control with economic activity, prioritizing public health outcomes while mitigating mobility disruptions."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the recommended inbound traffic allocations prioritize minimizing cumulative imported infections and deaths in Tennessee by carefully balancing epidemic risk from origin states with mobility needs. States with higher infection prevalence (I and E) relative to their susceptible population and significant inflows receive stricter traffic control in early and/or late weeks to reduce seeding risk during Tennessee's vulnerable periods. Relaxed flow is allowed mid-period where infection pressure is relatively stable or lower to support economic activity. The allocations ensure that total inflow per origin state remains constant over the 4 weeks, preserving baseline mobility while redistributing flow temporally to minimize peak importation. This temporal balancing leverages the nonlinear dynamics of epidemic spread, where early imported infections can seed exponential growth. By smoothing importation risk, Tennessee's healthcare capacity is less likely to be overwhelmed, lowering cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter front-loading of traffic control would be warranted. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccination improves, more even or relaxed allocations could be adopted. Cross-state cooperation is inherent in this approach, as controlling importation from high-risk states reduces secondary transmission within Tennessee, benefiting all. Overall, these allocations represent a sound compromise between epidemic control and mobility preservation, grounded in quantitative epidemic reasoning and real population and flow data."

Given the steady infection presence, a strict-first approach is recommended, where inbound flow is reduced more in the earlier weeks (f1=f2=0.30) to curb initial importation risk, then slightly relaxed later (f3=0.20, f4=0.20) as Tennessee's local control may improve. This balances epidemic control and mobility needs, keeping total flow constant. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.30+0.30+0.20+0.20=1)."

Conversely, states with lower flows or infection prevalence adopt even or relaxed-first patterns to maintain mobility while managing risk. The quantitative logic relies on the expected imported infected cases being approximately proportional to Flow * fraction * (Infected/Population), so adjusting fractions directly modulates importation pressure. Balancing across states and weeks prevents overwhelming Tennessee's healthcare and containment capacity. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls should be intensified; if local epidemic control improves, relaxation can accelerate.

Given the high average daily inflow of 118,771, the expected imported infections each week can be approximated by Flow*ft*(I/population), where population is sum of SEIQRD states. Because Alabama's infection pressure is moderate but the flow is very large, a strict-first pattern is chosen to reduce initial imported infections when Tennessee's local infections are still substantial (I=2,792). The fractions start low (0.20) to impose stricter control early, then relax slightly in weeks 3 and 4 to balance mobility needs. Trade-offs consider that very strict controls over all weeks would impair economic and social activities, so a moderate easing in later weeks is optimal. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.20+0.25+0.30+0.25=1.00), validating the allocation."

The expected imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/population). Since Arizona's infections are relatively stable, an even pattern with a slight strict-last approach is used to limit introduction of infections as Tennessee aims to reduce cumulative cases. The fractions are highest upfront to allow some mobility, then decrease to impose more control later. This balances early economic activity with infection control as Tennessee's local epidemic evolves. The sum of fractions is exactly 1.00."

The imported infected estimate is sensitive to flow and infection ratio. Given the relatively high infection pressure and inflow, a strict-first pattern is adopted to minimize early introductions when Tennessee's infections remain notable. The fractions begin low and ramp up, allowing gradual relaxation. This approach manages the trade-off by limiting early risk while permitting more movement later.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic control policies for Tennessee strategically balance epidemic control and mobility across all origin states to minimize cumulative infections and deaths. States with high infected or exposed populations combined with large inflow volumes, such as Alabama, Arkansas, South Carolina, and Ohio, follow strict-first patterns with lower initial fractions to reduce early imported infections when Tennessee's local epidemic is still active. This front-loading of strict controls effectively lowers the risk of seeding new outbreaks. Conversely, states with low infected prevalence or low inflow, such as Idaho, Nebraska, and Wisconsin, adopt even or relaxed-first patterns allowing more normalized mobility initially, since their contribution to imported infections is minimal. The weekly fractions for each origin state sum exactly to 1, ensuring total inbound flow is conserved while allowing temporal redistribution to optimize risk. The approach leverages quantitative logic approximating imported infections as proportional to the product of inflow, fraction, and infection prevalence (I/population), guiding stricter controls when infection pressure is higher. The collective effect is a coordinated reduction in infection importation risk across all weeks and states, smoothing demand on Tennessee's healthcare system and facilitating economic activity where safe. Sensitivity to parameters like transmission rate beta implies that if infection prevalence or transmissibility increases, stricter front-loaded controls would become even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence declines or vaccination coverage improves, gradual relaxation could accelerate. This dynamic allocation approach provides flexibility to adjust weekly controls based on epidemic trends, balancing public health with social and economic needs."
