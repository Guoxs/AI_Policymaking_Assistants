  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Ohio, the overall strategy prioritizes reducing inbound flows from origin states with higher infection prevalence and/or larger inflows during the early weeks, when imported infections contribute most to local spread. The strict-first pattern applied broadly means the initial week sees the lowest fraction of inbound flow, sharply curtailing the seeding of new infections. This early suppression reduces exponential growth potential in Ohio. Subsequent weeks gradually relax controls, allowing increasing mobility as risk decreases or as local control improves. Quantitatively, imported infected cases per week approximate Flow*ft*(I/Population), so lowering ft in early weeks in higher-risk origin states reduces total imported infections. Cross-state coordination balances the risk by allocating stricter controls to states with higher I/population or larger inflow, distributing mobility allowances to lower-risk states or later weeks. This cooperation reduces peak imported infections and cumulative epidemic burden. Sensitivity analysis suggests if prevalence or transmission rate beta rises, the strict-first approach's benefit amplifies, as early importation drives outbreaks more. Conversely, if prevalence falls or beta decreases, more relaxed patterns could suffice.

The strict-first pattern applied broadly means the initial week sees the lowest fraction of inbound flow, sharply curtailing the seeding of new infections. This early suppression reduces exponential growth potential in Ohio. Subsequent weeks gradually relax controls, allowing increasing mobility as risk decreases or as local control improves. Quantitatively, imported infected cases per week approximate Flow*ft*(I/Population), so lowering ft in early weeks in higher-risk origin states reduces total imported infections. Cross-state coordination balances the risk by allocating stricter controls to states with higher I/population or larger inflow, distributing mobility allowances to lower-risk states or later weeks. This cooperation reduces peak imported infections and cumulative epidemic burden. Sensitivity analysis suggests if prevalence or transmission rate beta rises, the strict-first approach's benefit amplifies, as early importation drives outbreaks more. Conversely, if prevalence falls or beta decreases, more relaxed patterns could suffice. Overall, this pattern optimally balances epidemic control and economic mobility, minimizing total cases and deaths in Ohio over the next 4 weeks."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Ohio, this policy collectively prioritizes reducing early imported infections from states with high infection prevalence or large inbound traffic by implementing stricter traffic controls in weeks 1 and 2 ('strict-first' pattern). States with high infected populations and flows (e.g., Arkansas, Tennessee, Indiana, Michigan) have stronger early restrictions to suppress seeding risk. Conversely, states with low infected counts or large flow but low prevalence (e.g., Kentucky, Virginia) receive more even allocation to balance mobility and epidemic control. The overall quantitative logic approximates imported infected cases as inbound flow * fraction * (I/population), indicating that reducing early fractions where infection prevalence is high achieves lower seeding risk. This staggered control across states and weeks spreads the mobility burden, preventing simultaneous over-restriction that can cause socio-economic harm. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early restrictions would be warranted, while if prevalence decreases, more relaxed or even allocations suffice. Balancing epidemic control with mobility needs requires careful modulation of traffic fractions, which is reflected in the differentiated patterns chosen. The exact sum to 1.000 for each state ensures flow conservation over the 4 weeks. This policy aims to strategically time mobility relaxations and restrictions to minimize Ohio's imported infection pressure and resultant morbidity and mortality."

    "notes": "Alabama shows a relatively low infected (I=457) and exposed (E=1468) population compared to its large susceptible base (S=4857550), indicating moderate infection pressure. The expected imported infected cases approximately scale with Flow*ft*(I/Population). Given the high average daily inflow (22066.93), front-loading stricter control (low fractions early) can reduce immediate importation risk. The chosen pattern is strict-first, with fractions decreasing over weeks to allow gradual relaxation as risk is managed. This balances epidemic control by minimizing early influx of infectious individuals and mobility needs by easing restrictions later. The fractions sum precisely to 1.000, ensuring total flow remains constant."

With a daily inflow of 9376.46, imported infections scale with flow and prevalence. A strict-first pattern reduces initial imported infections when prevalence is high, then gradually relaxes. This approach balances reducing early transmission risk while preserving mobility over time. The fractions sum to 1.000 exactly, preserving total flow volume."

The daily inflow is 5005.29. To minimize imported infections, a strict-first control pattern is adopted, concentrating stricter limits early when infection prevalence is significant, then easing control gradually. This reduces new introductions of infections into Ohio effectively, balancing public health and economic mobility. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the recommended inbound traffic allocations prioritize reducing early-week imported infections when prevalence (I and E) in origin states is highest, following a strict-first control pattern for most states. This approach minimizes the cumulative expected imported infections, which scale approximately as Flow*ft*(I+E)/Population, thus reducing the seeding and amplification of local outbreaks in Ohio. The strict-first pattern also mitigates the risk of overwhelming Ohio's health system early in the 4-week horizon, allowing time for local epidemic control measures to take effect. For states with very high inflow and moderate infection prevalence (e.g., Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky), a slightly more balanced or even pattern is used to maintain mobility without sharp spikes in risk. This graded approach balances epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs, recognizing that overly strict, prolonged controls may have adverse effects. Quantitatively, by preserving total flow but redistributing weekly proportions, the strategy reduces front-loaded infection pressure while gradually restoring traffic as risk diminishes or stabilizes. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early reductions become even more beneficial, while lower prevalence supports more relaxed or even distribution. The approach also acknowledges inter-state cooperation: by allocating stricter controls to states with higher infection pressure and inflows, the aggregate imported infection burden to Ohio is minimized across weeks and states. This cooperative risk balancing supports sustainable epidemic control and mobility restoration. The fractions sum precisely to 1.000 for each origin state, maintaining total flow volume while enabling temporal optimization."

The daily inbound flow to Ohio is significant (13283.8), so imported infections could be approximated by Flow*ft*(I/population). Given the relatively low infection prevalence (I/population ~7.6e-5), the risk of importation is moderate. An even distribution (even pattern) over the 4 weeks is chosen to balance epidemic control and mobility. This avoids sudden spikes of inbound flow which could increase transmission risk, while allowing steady economic and social activity. Stricter control in early weeks could cause economic harm, and relaxed control early could increase infections. The fractions sum exactly to 1, validating the distribution."

The inbound flow (8305.8) is lower but still substantial. The expected imported infected cases scale as Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing early week inbound flow reduces immediate importation risk. A strict-first pattern with higher fractions in weeks 1 and 2 (0.3,0.3) and lower in weeks 3 and 4 (0.2,0.2) aims to front-load inbound traffic while monitoring infection trends. This balances epidemic control by reducing peak importation risk early and gradually relaxing. The fractions sum to 1 exactly."

The inbound flow is moderate (4791.3). The risk of importing infections is non-trivial, so a relaxed-first pattern is chosen: fractions higher in weeks 2 and 3 (0.3,0.3) and lower in weeks 1 and 4 (0.2,0.2).

  "global_guidance": "Our strategy allocates inbound traffic fractions from each origin state to Ohio over the next 4 weeks to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. We balance infection risk, mobility needs, and epidemic control by analyzing origin states' SEIQRD compositions and inbound flows. States with higher infection prevalence (I/population) and higher inbound flows pose greater risk for importing infectious individuals, which scales roughly as Flow*ft*(I/population). For such states (e.g., Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan), we apply a relaxed-first pattern that starts with stricter controls (lower fractions in early weeks) and gradually relaxes traffic to prevent early surges in importation. For states with moderate risk and flow, we often choose even or strict-first patterns to reduce initial importation risk while preserving mobility. The patterns consider Ohio's current epidemic status and the need to avoid abrupt changes that could adversely affect social and economic activity. By distributing inbound flow fractions to sum to exactly 1, we maintain total inbound volume but modulate timing to flatten importation risk peaks. Cross-state coordination spreads risk over time, preventing simultaneous high importation from multiple sources. Sensitivity to prevalence and transmissibility (beta) suggests that if infection rates rise, stricter early controls should be intensified. Conversely, with lower prevalence or increased vaccination, more relaxed patterns could be adopted. This approach optimizes Ohio's epidemic trajectory by mitigating imported infections without undue mobility constraints, balancing public health and economic considerations."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policy across all origin states adopts a predominantly strict-first pattern, where inbound flows are restricted more heavily in the initial weeks and gradually relaxed in later weeks. This approach strategically minimizes the early importation of exposed and infected individuals into Ohio, thereby reducing the seeding of new infections and consequent downstream confirmed and deceased cases. The logic underpinning this is that early-stage strict controls reduce the effective reproduction number within Ohio by limiting virus introduction during periods of higher infectious prevalence in origin states. Quantitatively, the expected imported infected cases from each state i at week t is proportional to Flow_i * fraction_t * (I_i / population_i), where I_i and population_i are the infected and total population of the origin state, respectively. By allocating lower fractions (stricter controls) in weeks 1 and 2, when infection prevalence is highest, we reduce the immediate pressure on Ohio's health system. Simultaneously, gradual relaxation in weeks 3 and 4 balances the economic and social costs of mobility restrictions, allowing partial restoration of travel and commerce. Cross-state coordination is reflected in allocating stricter early controls to states with higher infection or exposed counts and higher flow volumes to Ohio, such as Michigan, Kentucky, Indiana, and Texas, while states with lower prevalence see slightly more moderate restrictions but still follow the overall strict-first pattern. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase in certain origin states, further frontloading of restrictions or extending the strict period could be warranted. Conversely, if prevalence declines rapidly, a more balanced or relaxed-first pattern might be feasible. This adaptive traffic control strategy thus dynamically balances epidemic control and mobility restoration, ensuring that the total inbound flow over four weeks remains constant while strategically modifying weekly distributions to minimize Ohio's epidemic burden."

  "global_guidance": "The traffic control recommendations collectively prioritize early-week restrictions (strict-first pattern) for origin states with higher infection prevalence (e.g., Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Utah) and large inbound flow, to reduce early importation of infected individuals into Ohio. For states with lower infected counts and moderate or low flows, even distribution is preferred to sustain steady mobility while controlling risk. The rationale is that imported infections approximately scale with Flow * ft * (I / population), so reducing ft in early weeks for higher risk states effectively lowers cumulative imported cases and deaths. This staggered relaxation allows Ohio's epidemic control measures to handle imported cases without overwhelming healthcare resources. The cooperation logic balances traffic volumes across weeks and states, allocating stricter controls early on when infection pressure is highest and relaxing later as conditions improve and immunity accumulates. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter initial controls and longer gradual relaxation would be warranted. Conversely, if prevalence or beta falls, more even or relaxed patterns could be suitable to restore mobility. This strategy minimizes total burden on Ohio while maintaining essential connectivity and economic activity."

Given the relatively low infection prevalence (~0.01% infected), a balanced even distribution (even pattern) of traffic over the 4 weeks is chosen to avoid sudden spikes while maintaining consistent mobility.

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocations are designed to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Ohio by balancing epidemic control and mobility across all origin states. States with higher infection prevalence (high I and E relative to susceptible) and high inflow volumes (e.g., Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Tennessee) receive stricter early week controls (strict-first pattern) to reduce imported infections during peak transmission risk. Conversely, states with low prevalence and/or low inflow have even or relaxed-first patterns to maintain economic activity without substantial epidemic risk. The logic follows that imported infected cases scale approximately as Flow*ft*(I/total population), so reducing ft during weeks with higher local or origin infection prevalence lowers importation risk. The allocations sum to exactly 1 per state, ensuring total inflow remains constant but is redistributed to optimize outcomes over time. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase in origin states, stricter early controls should be intensified to prevent seeding Ohio's epidemic. Conversely, improved local control in Ohio or origin states allows more relaxation. Coordination across states ensures that imported infections are temporally smoothed, preventing overwhelming Ohio's healthcare system. This dynamic balancing and temporal redistribution approach strategically reduces overall epidemic burden while preserving essential mobility and economic functions."

The confirmed cases (14,562) are significantly high, indicating a controlled but present epidemic. Given the high daily inflow to Ohio (12,299), the imported infected can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/population). Alabama's I/population ratio is low (~0.000079), but due to large flow, imported infections remain notable. We adopt an even pattern to balance mobility and epidemic control, as Alabama's epidemic state is stable without strong increasing or decreasing trends. Lowering flow too strictly may cause economic disruption without proportional epidemiological gain. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000, validating allocation."

The daily inflow to Ohio is moderate (6,700). Given a slight decline in infection pressure, a relaxed-first pattern is chosen, prioritizing higher flow in earlier weeks (30%) and stricter controls later (20%). This anticipates a potential rise in local cases or prevents importation during peak infectiousness. Imported infected roughly estimated as Flow*ft*(I/population); Arizona's I/population is about 0.000068. The fractions add precisely to 1.000, ensuring consistency."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocation strategy across these origin states is designed to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Ohio by reducing early importation of infected individuals, especially from high-prevalence states. States with high infected and exposed counts relative to their populations, and with substantial inflow to Ohio, are targeted with strict-first traffic control patternsallocating lower fractions of flow in the earliest weeks when the risk of importing active infections is highest. This approach minimizes the seeding of new outbreaks in Ohio early on, when cumulative epidemic growth can be most exponential. Conversely, states with low infection prevalence but high flow have more relaxed or even traffic allocation to balance mobility needs and economic activity. The consistent enforcement of the sum of fractions equaling exactly 1 ensures the total inbound flow remains constant over the 4 weeks, preserving overall travel volume while strategically redistributing temporal risk. Quantitatively, imported infections from each state scale as Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing ft in early weeks for high prevalence states lowers immediate infection importation. The cooperative balancing across states allows Ohio to manage epidemic risk without overly restricting mobility from all sources simultaneously, which could be socioeconomically harmful. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early week reductions become even more critical. Alternatively, if prevalence decreases or immunity (R) rises, a more relaxed allocation could be feasible. This nuanced, data-driven approach dynamically balances epidemic control and mobility, optimizing public health outcomes for Ohio."

  "global_guidance": "The collective approach across all origin states aims to minimize imported infections into Ohio by adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions while keeping total flow constant. States with higher infected and exposed prevalence relative to their susceptible population and with moderate to high inflows are assigned strict-first patterns, reducing early week inbound flows to curb initial seeding of infections in Ohio. Conversely, states with lower or more stable infection prevalence or very high mobility demands are assigned even or relaxed-first patterns to balance epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs. The trade-off is managed by front-loading stricter controls where infection pressure is higher and allowing gradual relaxation to maintain overall mobility. Quantitatively, expected imported infections scale with inbound flow fraction and the ratio of infectious individuals to the population in origin states. This proportional reasoning guides fraction allocation to minimize cumulative cases and deaths in Ohio. Sensitivity to changes in prevalence or transmission parameters would affect the strictness needed; higher prevalence or transmissibility (beta) would require stricter early controls, while lower would allow more relaxed patterns. The policy also implicitly balances risk across weeks and states, avoiding overload in any single period and maintaining manageable epidemic growth. All fractions per origin state sum exactly to 1, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant, meeting the critical requirement. This coordinated multi-state, multi-week traffic control policy is designed to slow disease spread effectively while preserving necessary mobility."

The risk of importing infection is proportional to the daily inflow (22066.93) and the infected fraction I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D). Expected imported infections ~ Flow*ft*(I/population). Given moderate infection pressure, a strict-first pattern is chosen: stricter control initially (f1=0.3) to reduce importation early when Ohio is still vulnerable (E=5733, I=5391). Later weeks relax control as infection pressure stabilizes and to balance mobility needs. Trade-off is balancing early epidemic control with maintaining some mobility.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic control policies for Ohio's origin states collectively aim to minimize imported infections and deaths by adjusting weekly traffic fractions while preserving total flow. States with high infected and exposed populations, especially those with large daily inflows into Ohio (e.g., Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, South Carolina, Tennessee), are assigned a strict-first pattern with higher traffic restrictions in the initial weeks (higher f1, lower f4). This helps prevent early epidemic seeding in Ohio when its own infection levels remain significant. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflows receive more balanced or even traffic allocation patterns to maintain steady economic activity while ensuring moderate epidemic control. The expected imported infections are proportional to the product of flow, weekly fraction, and the infected fraction in the origin states, so front-loading restrictions in high-risk states reduces early importation risk. By staggering restrictions among states and weeks, the policy balances the trade-offs between epidemic control and mobility: strict early controls can reduce subsequent transmission but may hamper economic activity, while gradual relaxation allows recovery of mobility as risk declines. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early restrictions would be even more beneficial, while lower prevalence permits more relaxed policies. This coordinated approach across states and weeks optimally reduces cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Ohio while sustaining essential mobility demands."

The expected imported infections can be approximated as imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population).

States with higher infected (I) and exposed (E) ratios relative to their populations and with larger daily inflows to Ohio have stricter traffic restrictions in the first two weeks ('strict-first' pattern). This reduces the initial seeding of infections and allows Ohio's health system and contact tracing to cope better. States with lower infection prevalence or smaller flows have more balanced or even allocation to maintain mobility and economic activity, reflecting a trade-off between epidemic control and societal needs. The quantitative cooperation logic ensures that the total inbound flow over 4 weeks remains constant per state, preserving baseline mobility but redistributing weekly fractions to flatten infection importation peaks. This coordinated approach balances risk across states and weeks, minimizing overall infections and deaths in Ohio. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence (I/population) or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early restrictions become more critical, whereas if prevalence decreases, mobility can be relaxed sooner. Therefore, this policy is adaptive and risk-based, leveraging SEIQRD epidemiological data and mobility patterns to optimize inbound flow timing and intensity. All fractions sum exactly to 1.0000 per state, ensuring consistency and feasibility of implementation."

Given the large flow to Ohio (8851.4 daily), the imported infected number approximates Flow*ft*(I/population), which is small due to low I/population ratio. We choose an even pattern to maintain balance between epidemic control and mobility, as strict frontloading or relaxation is not justified by infection trends.

  "global_guidance": "The overall inbound traffic control policy across all origin states aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Ohio by balancing the timing and intensity of mobility restrictions based on infection prevalence and flow volume. States with high infected and exposed populations combined with large inbound flow to Ohio (e.g., Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan) receive stricter early-week restrictions to reduce the immediate importation of infectious individuals. This strict-first pattern helps Ohio reduce seeding of new infections early on. Mid and late weeks have more relaxed controls to balance economic and social mobility needs while maintaining epidemic control. States with low infected prevalence or low flow (e.g., Nebraska, Iowa, Idaho) receive even traffic allocation, reflecting balanced risk. The 4-week fractions for each state sum exactly to 1, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant as required. This coordinated approach distributes risk over time and states, reducing peak importation pressure and allowing Ohio's healthcare system to manage cases effectively. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early restrictions would become more critical. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccination/immunity rises, more relaxed patterns could be adopted to support mobility. Cooperation and timing of restrictions across states are crucial; by aligning strict-first patterns in high-risk states and even or mild patterns in low-risk states, Ohio can minimize overall epidemic impact while sustaining necessary mobility and economic activity."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce expected imported infections and deaths in Ohio, the traffic control policy allocates inbound flow fractions to origin states based on their infection prevalence relative to population size and current epidemic trends. States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to their susceptible populations (e.g., Arkansas, Idaho, Utah) have stricter control in early weeks (strict-first pattern), reducing early import risk when detection and quarantine may be less effective. Conversely, states with moderate or stable infection levels use relaxed-first or even patterns to balance epidemic control while permitting economic activity. The key quantitative cooperation logic is that total inbound flow per state remains constant, but by shifting flows to weeks of lower infection pressure or better control capacity, cumulative imported infections can be minimized. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early-week controls become more critical to prevent seeding of outbreaks in Ohio. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or control measures improve, more uniform or relaxed flows may be effective. This dynamic allocation across 19 origin states leverages temporal and spatial heterogeneity in epidemic dynamics to optimize inbound flow management, minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Ohio while maintaining essential mobility. The fractions for all states sum to exactly 1.0000, validating the policy's consistency."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocation collectively aims to minimize imported infections into Ohio by adjusting weekly fractions according to infection prevalence and inflow volume from each origin state. States with higher infection ratios (I/population) such as Utah, Idaho, Arkansas, and New Mexico are assigned stricter control in early weeks (lower fractions) to curb initial importation risk. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or large populations but low infection ratios (e.g., Alabama, Texas, Iowa) are assigned even distributions to maintain mobility without significant epidemic risk. The relaxed-first pattern dominates for states with moderate to high infection pressure, frontloading restrictions early and relaxing later, which balances epidemic control and economic considerations. This staggered approach prevents overwhelming health systems and avoids sharp spikes in imported cases. Quantitatively, imported infections scale as Flow * ft * (I/population), so reducing ft in early weeks for high-risk states reduces early seeding events. The sum of fractions per state is strictly 1 to keep total flow constant, redistributing volume over weeks. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence increases, stricter early controls are more beneficial, while if transmission rates (beta) change, the timing of relaxation may shift. Coordinated cross-state management ensures that reductions in inflow from high-risk states in early weeks are compensated by easing restrictions in later weeks or from lower-risk states, maintaining economic stability. This dynamic balancing is critical to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Ohio while preserving necessary mobility."

    "notes": "Alabama has a moderate exposed (E=3613) and infected (I=1117) population relative to its susceptible (S=4762746). The infected proportion is low but not negligible, suggesting some risk of imported infections to Ohio. The imported infected cases can be approximated by Flow * ft * (I / Population), implying that higher flow fractions in weeks with higher infection prevalence would increase risk. Observing Alabama's stable but non-negligible infected count, we adopt a strict-first allocation pattern, reducing flow in early weeks (0.35, 0.30) and gradually relaxing controls later (0.20, 0.15). This approach minimizes early imported infection pressure when Ohio's own infections are high, while allowing mobility to resume progressively.

This indicates a higher risk of infection importation proportional to Flow * ft * (I / Population). Given the elevated infection pressure, a strict-first pattern is chosen to reduce inflow in the initial two weeks (0.30, 0.30), slightly relaxing in the third week (0.25) and more in the fourth (0.15). This pattern helps curb early importations when Ohios vulnerable population is highest and infection risk is critical, while gradually increasing flow as the epidemic hopefully subsides.

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy for Ohios inbound traffic control from all origin states prioritizes reducing imported infections early when Ohio's susceptible population is still high and infection risk most critical. The fundamental logic is that imported infections are approximately proportional to the product of inbound flow, the weekly flow fraction, and the infected proportion of the origin states population (imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / Population)). To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases, stricter traffic controls are implemented in the initial weeks (strict-first pattern) for states with higher infected or exposed prevalence, reducing the immediate influx of potentially infectious individuals. For states with very high infection prevalence (e.g., Idaho, Utah), a relaxed-first pattern is deployed, with very low initial fractions to strongly curb early introductions and gradually relax as the situation improves or Ohios immunity increases. States with moderate prevalence adopt a mixed approach, balancing control and mobility restoration. This cross-state cooperation logic leverages temporal redistribution of inbound flow fractions to keep total inbound flow constant while smoothing and lowering early importation pressure. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become even more critical to prevent surges. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccination improves, gradual relaxation can proceed faster. Balancing epidemic control and mobility, this policy aims to minimize secondary transmission and deaths while allowing phased economic recovery.

    "notes": "Alabama exhibits moderate infection levels with I=385 and a relatively high susceptible population (S=4,883,910). The expected imported infections approximately follow the formula imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population). Given Alabama's moderate infection pressure and large flow (12,299 daily), we adopt a strict-first pattern to reduce immediate importation risks. Thus, stricter controls in weeks 1 and 2 lower inbound flow fractions (0.35 and 0.30), progressively relaxing to 0.20 and 0.15 in weeks 3 and 4. This pattern balances epidemic control by minimizing early infection seeding in Ohio while permitting some mobility recovery later. The fractions sum exactly to 1, ensuring total flow remains constant."

    "notes": "Arizona's infected count is moderate (I=494) with a large susceptible base (S=7,247,763). The daily inbound flow to Ohio is 6,700, which is significant. Using imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), early weeks pose a higher risk if flows remain high. Therefore, a strict-first pattern is suitable, allocating higher restrictions early (week 4 fraction only 0.10). This front-loading of control reduces Ohio's importation risk when Arizona's prevalence might be higher. Later weeks relax controls gradually as potential infections reduce. This approach balances disease control with economic mobility by preserving later traffic. The sum of fractions is exactly 1."

Given the consistent infection pressure and smaller flow, an even pattern is chosen to spread control evenly over 4 weeks. This reduces sudden mobility shocks and maintains steady epidemic control.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies collectively aim to minimize Ohio's cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically allocating inbound flow fractions over 4 weeks from all origin states. States with higher infection and exposure rates, especially those with large daily inbound flows, are assigned a strict-first pattern with reduced flow fractions in weeks 1 and 2, thereby lowering the immediate importation risk of infectious individuals. This front-loading of control helps blunt early seeding of new cases within Ohio. Conversely, states with moderate or stable infection pressure and lower flows are assigned either even or relaxed-first patterns to balance epidemic control with economic and social mobility. The quantitative cooperation logic relies on imported infections approximated by Flow*ft*(I/population), guiding fraction allocations to times when infection pressure is highest or most dangerous. The total inbound flow for each origin state remains constant over 4 weeks, preserving economic activity volume but shifting timing to optimize epidemic outcomes. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter or longer front-loaded controls would be warranted. Conversely, if prevalence drops, more even or relaxed-first patterns could be adopted to restore mobility faster. This adaptive allocation supports robust epidemic control in Ohio by focusing resources and restrictions where and when importation risk is highest, thus minimizing expected imported infections and deaths while respecting mobility needs and economic considerations."
