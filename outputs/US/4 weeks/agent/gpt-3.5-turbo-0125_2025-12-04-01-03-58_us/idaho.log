The imported infected estimate roughly follows imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/Population), where I/Population ~ 7.88e-5. Given the moderate infection pressure, a balanced 'strict-first' pattern is chosen to reduce flows early to minimize early imported cases while gradually relaxing later. Early strong controls help prevent seeding outbreaks in Idaho. The trade-off balances mobility needs with epidemic control, ensuring sufficient inflow for economic activity but prioritizing health safety early on.

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocation strategy across origin states collectively aims to minimize Idaho's cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by strategically timing inflow restrictions. States with higher infection prevalence (I/S ratios) such as South Carolina, Arkansas, New Mexico, Tennessee, and Utah receive front-loaded strict traffic controls (strict-first pattern) to sharply reduce imported infections early. This timing prevents seeding new outbreaks in Idaho when local susceptibility remains high. Moderate risk states adopt balanced or slightly relaxed-first patterns to support mobility while managing cumulative risk. Low prevalence states have more relaxed early controls to balance economic activity with epidemic risk. Quantitatively, the imported infections scale approximately as Flow*ft*(I/Population), so adjusting ft weekly redistributes total flow without changing total volume, but reduces risk concentration. Early strict controls (low ft in initial weeks) lower immediate imported cases, critical to epidemic control given exponential growth dynamics. Later relaxation (higher ft in weeks 3-4) manages economic and social mobility needs, avoiding prolonged disruption. This cooperative cross-state approach balances Idaho's epidemic constraints with origin states' mobility baselines, optimizing overall risk. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become even more beneficial to prevent rapid outbreak growth. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, the model could allow more relaxed early fractions, enhancing mobility. The exact fractions sum to 1.0000 for each state, ensuring consistent total inbound flow over the 4 weeks. This policy framework supports dynamic epidemic control while respecting economic considerations, tailored to origin states' epidemic status and flow magnitudes."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Idaho, traffic allocations from all origin states are designed to balance epidemic control and mobility needs. States with higher infection prevalence and exposed populations, such as Utah, Michigan, Ohio, and Arizona, are assigned stricter early-week controls (lower fractions in weeks 1 and 2) to reduce immediate importation of infections, adhering to strict-first or relaxed-first patterns depending on the infection dynamics. Conversely, states with low infection pressure like Alabama and Mississippi have even or mildly relaxed allocations to maintain steady economic activity. The overall strategy emphasizes reducing imported infections early, when the susceptible pool in Idaho is still large, to prevent exponential growth. Quantitatively, imported infections scale approximately with Flow*ft*(I/Population), so reducing ft in early weeks for high-risk states lowers expected imported infections. By distributing restrictions unevenly over weeks, the policy avoids excessive mobility loss while strategically timing controls to impact epidemic curves most effectively. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more critical to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence declines or local control improves, flow fractions can be relaxed sooner. This coordinated inter-state allocation leverages temporal and spatial heterogeneity to minimize Idaho's epidemic burden while preserving essential mobility."

    "notes": "Alabama's low infected (I=426) and exposed (E=1360) relative to its large susceptible population (S=4,856,818) and high inflow (987.7 daily) implies moderate importation risk proportional to flow and prevalence. Imported infected estimated as ~Flow*ft*(I/Population). We adopt a slight strict-first pattern reducing early week inflow to mitigate immediate risk, then relaxing gradually. This controls seeding infections early while balancing mobility needs. Weekly fractions sum to 1 exactly (0.3+0.25+0.25+0.2=1). Trade-off: stricter early controls reduce new cases but impact travel; later relaxation permits economic recovery."

Imported infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/Population) is significant. We use a relaxed-first pattern, allowing more traffic initially to prevent sharp economic impacts, then tighten mid-period to preempt infection rise. This pattern balances epidemic control with mobility, acknowledging infection pressure may peak later. Fractions sum exactly to 1.

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic allocation for Idaho prioritizes minimizing imported infections by adjusting weekly fractions per origin state's infection prevalence and inflow levels. States with higher infected and exposed counts relative to population and inflow receive stricter early week controls (lower fractions) to reduce initial seeding of the virus, reflecting a strict-first pattern. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure or large susceptible populations but moderate prevalence adopt relaxed-first or even patterns to balance economic impacts and epidemic control. This cross-state strategy ensures the total inbound flow remains constant but spreads risk temporally, preventing overwhelming Idaho's healthcare system early in the 4-week period. Quantitatively, imported infections are proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing ft when I/population is high effectively lowers case importation. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become more crucial to prevent outbreak exacerbation. Conversely, if prevalence declines, relaxing controls earlier is plausible. This dynamic, cooperative approach across origin states balances epidemic risk reduction and mobility maintenance, supporting Idaho's public health while mitigating economic disruption."

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy for Idaho's inbound traffic control balances epidemic control and mobility by adjusting weekly fractions per origin state based on their infection prevalence and inbound flow magnitude. States with high infection prevalence and/or large inbound flows (e.g., Arizona, Texas, Utah) are assigned stricter early-week controls (lower fractions) to minimize early importation of infected individuals, thus reducing the epidemic pressure on Idaho. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflows receive more even or relaxed fraction patterns to maintain economic and social connectivity. The imported infected cases from each origin are roughly proportional to the product of daily inbound flow, weekly fraction, and the ratio of infected individuals to total population (Flow * ft * (I / population)). Adjusting ft weekly allows temporal smoothing of importation risk, preventing peaks that could overwhelm Idaho's healthcare capacity. This temporal balancing is a form of quantitative cooperation across states, limiting simultaneous high-risk importation events. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission parameters (beta) increase, stricter early-week controls become more critical to prevent surges. Conversely, if prevalence drops, controls can be relaxed more quickly. This approach also accounts for exposed individuals as a potential source of future infections, justifying stricter control early where E is high. The fractions for each state sum exactly to 1.000 ensuring total inbound flow remains constant over the 4 weeks, fulfilling constraint requirements. By tailoring fraction patterns per origin state's epidemic status and flow size, Idaho can minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases while preserving mobility as much as possible."

The exposed and confirmed cases are moderate compared to population size. The expected imported infected individuals can be approximated as imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population). Since the infection pressure is low and stable, a moderate and slightly front-loaded strict-first pattern is chosen to reduce importation risk early while allowing some relaxation in weeks 2 and 3, balancing economic and social mobility interests.

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce the expected imported infections and deaths in Idaho, the inbound traffic allocations for each origin state have been strategically tailored based on their respective infection prevalence and population compositions. States with higher infection prevalence and exposed populations, such as Arizona, Michigan, Ohio, Texas, and Utah, have been assigned patterns that emphasize stronger restrictions in earlier weeks (strict-first or relaxed-first patterns) to curb the importation of infected individuals during critical periods of potential spread. These patterns allow Idaho to reduce the pressure of imported cases early while gradually permitting mobility as infection dynamics stabilize. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure, such as Alabama, Kentucky, and Virginia, have more balanced or slight strict-first patterns to maintain steady control without overly restricting economic activities. The total inbound flow over 4 weeks is conserved for each state, ensuring no net loss in connectivity but redistributing it to minimize risk. This cross-state coordination balances the infection risks by front-loading restrictions where prevalence is higher and smoothing restrictions where infection rates are stable or low. The sensitivity of these recommendations depends on the accuracy of infection prevalence estimates and the transmission parameters (beta, alpha, gamma, mu). Should the infection rates or transmission dynamics vary significantly, the fractions can be adjusted to either intensify early controls or relax them accordingly. Overall, this approach aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Idaho by optimally timing travel inflows according to infection pressure from each origin state while maintaining essential mobility."

The infected fraction is quite low, indicating a lower immediate risk of importing infectious individuals. The expected imported infections can be approximated by Flow * ft * (I / population). Given the low infection prevalence, a moderate traffic control pattern with slightly stricter early weeks (0.3, 0.3) and relaxed later weeks (0.2, 0.2) balances mobility and risk. The strict-first pattern helps reduce early importation when Idaho's own infections are still high, minimizing seeding events.

The infection prevalence is higher than Alabama, increasing risk of imported cases (Flow * ft * I/population). The relaxed-first pattern (increasing fractions over weeks) is chosen because Idaho's internal epidemic is currently active, so delaying traffic relaxation reduces early imported infections. This allows Idaho to reduce overall cases and deaths by controlling external pressure when its own case load is high.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies collectively aim to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Idaho by adjusting inbound traffic fractions over the next four weeks by origin state. High-risk origin states with high infected and exposed counts relative to their population, such as Utah, Michigan, Tennessee, Ohio, and Arizona, are assigned strict-first or relaxed-first patterns that reduce inbound flow in early weeks when Idaho's internal epidemic intensity is high. This prevents seeding of new infections and reduces cumulative cases and deaths. Lower-risk states with lower infection prevalence are given even distributions to balance epidemic control and maintain economic activity. The total inbound traffic over four weeks remains constant for each origin, preserving overall mobility but shifting traffic to weeks with lower infection pressure. This cooperative balancing among states reduces imported infections as the expected imported infections roughly scale with Flow * ft * (I/population). Sensitivity analysis suggests that if the infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls and more aggressive delayed relaxation would be needed to mitigate increased importation risk. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed patterns could be adopted.

High-risk origin states with high infected and exposed counts relative to their population, such as Utah, Michigan, Tennessee, Ohio, and Arizona, are assigned strict-first or relaxed-first patterns that reduce inbound flow in early weeks when Idaho's internal epidemic intensity is high. This prevents seeding of new infections and reduces cumulative cases and deaths. Lower-risk states with lower infection prevalence are given even distributions to balance epidemic control and maintain economic activity. The total inbound traffic over four weeks remains constant for each origin, preserving overall mobility but shifting traffic to weeks with lower infection pressure. This cooperative balancing among states reduces imported infections as the expected imported infections roughly scale with Flow * ft * (I/population). Sensitivity analysis suggests that if the infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls and more aggressive delayed relaxation would be needed to mitigate increased importation risk. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed patterns could be adopted. Overall, this strategy balances epidemic control in Idaho by minimizing imported infection pressure early when local infections are substantial and gradually relaxing controls to support economic mobility as the epidemic stabilizes."

States with higher exposed and infected populations, such as Utah, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, and Tennessee, receive stricter initial controls with gradually relaxed traffic allowances to prevent early imported infections when Idaho's internal epidemic control is more vulnerable. This 'relaxed-first' or 'strict-first' approach balances the trade-off between reducing infection importation and allowing economic and social mobility. States with moderate or low infection prevalence adopt even traffic distributions, maintaining steady control without abrupt changes that could cause spikes in infections. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/population), so these allocations reduce risk by lowering ft in periods of high infectious pressure. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls would be even more critical, whereas improved local control in Idaho could allow faster relaxation. The coordination across states and weeks ensures that total inbound flows remain constant, preserving overall mobility while strategically timing restrictions to optimize epidemic outcomes. This cooperative, data-driven approach balances epidemic control with the necessity of maintaining mobility and economic activity."

The imported infected flow can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/population). Given the large population and low infection prevalence, the risk of imported infections from Alabama is low. An even distribution of traffic fractions equally spreads inbound flow over the 4 weeks, avoiding sudden spikes that could increase transmission risk. This even pattern balances epidemic control and mobility by maintaining moderate control each week without harsh restrictions. The fractions sum exactly to 1, validating the allocation."

The expected imported infections scale as Flow*ft*(I/population). To minimize initial risk, stricter control is applied in week 1 (f1=0.1) and gradually relaxed to week 4 (f4=0.45) as infection pressure is expected to be managed internally. This relaxed-first pattern is chosen because spreading out the flow later reduces early seeding of infections in Idaho. The fractions sum to 1 with four decimals, ensuring correct allocation."

The imported infection risk approximates Flow*ft*(I/population). Here, a strict-first pattern is recommended with heavier restrictions in later weeks (f3=0.2, f4=0.2) to avoid late surges, while allowing more mobility upfront (f1=0.3, f2=0.3) when internal Idaho infections may be better controlled.

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the traffic control allocations prioritize stricter restrictions in weeks when infection pressure from origin states is high, especially for states with elevated infectious and exposed populations such as Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Michigan, and Wisconsin. This staggered approach delays and reduces importation of infectious individuals early on, allowing Idaho's internal epidemic control measures to be more effective. Lowering f1 fractions for high-risk states reduces initial seeding of infections, while gradually relaxing controls in later weeks balances socio-economic needs with epidemic control. States with low infectious prevalence and flow are assigned even or balanced patterns to maintain steady mobility without risking sudden infection spikes. The sum-to-one constraint ensures total inbound flow remains consistent with ground truth, preserving essential connectivity while optimizing timing of restrictions. Sensitivity to prevalence and transmission rate (beta) is considered by shifting more restrictions earlier for states with high infection prevalence, as higher beta amplifies secondary transmission risks. If prevalence or beta increase, further strict-first adjustments would be warranted to mitigate importation risks. Conversely, lower prevalence or beta could allow more relaxed patterns. This cooperative allocation across all origin states distributes epidemic risks temporally, reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Idaho more effectively than uniform or uncoordinated policies."
