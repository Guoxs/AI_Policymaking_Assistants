The risk of imported infected individuals is roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), so controlling flow in earlier weeks reduces early imported cases. We adopt a strict-first pattern (lower fractions in week 1 and 2) because early restriction helps reduce seeding of infections especially since Alabama's inflow is moderate (1044 daily).

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies across all origin states aim to collectively reduce the cumulative imported infections and deaths in Nebraska by strategically adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions while keeping the total 4-week inbound flow constant. States with high infection prevalence (I and E) and/or high inbound flow are assigned stricter early-week control (strict-first pattern), reducing early seeding of infections in Nebraska, which is critical to minimize exponential growth and deaths. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or moderate inflow adopt even or relaxed-first patterns to balance mobility needs and economic activity without significantly increasing risk. The cooperation logic balances weekly restrictions across states so that the overall imported infection pressure is smoothed over time, preventing overwhelming peaks in new cases. This distributed approach reduces the risk of cascading outbreaks from multiple sources simultaneously.

States with high infection prevalence (I and E) and/or high inbound flow are assigned stricter early-week control (strict-first pattern), reducing early seeding of infections in Nebraska, which is critical to minimize exponential growth and deaths. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or moderate inflow adopt even or relaxed-first patterns to balance mobility needs and economic activity without significantly increasing risk. The cooperation logic balances weekly restrictions across states so that the overall imported infection pressure is smoothed over time, preventing overwhelming peaks in new cases. This distributed approach reduces the risk of cascading outbreaks from multiple sources simultaneously. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or the transmission rate beta increases, stricter early-week controls would become even more critical to limit imported cases. Conversely, if prevalence falls or beta declines, more relaxed policies could be safely adopted.

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic allocation strategy for Nebraska prioritizes minimizing cumulative imported infections and deaths by enforcing stricter controls in weeks with higher infection pressures across origin states. States with higher infectious and exposed individuals relative to their population, such as Arkansas, Idaho, and Tennessee, receive stricter initial restrictions (strict-first patterns) to reduce early seeding of infections into Nebraska. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or very large susceptible populations but lower infectious prevalence, like Iowa, adopt a relaxed-first pattern to maintain economic activity while monitoring risk. Equal fraction distributions for states with steady infection prevalence and moderate inflow, such as Michigan, South Carolina, New Mexico, and Wisconsin, ensure balanced epidemic control without harsh mobility shocks. The strategy follows the principle that imported infections are roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), where adjusting ft reduces imported infectious cases in critical early weeks. This temporal balancing allows Nebraska to prevent sharp spikes in imported infections and provides time for local control measures to be effective. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early-week controls become more critical to prevent overwhelming local healthcare. Conversely, lower beta or prevalence allows more relaxed policies without compromising control. Coordinated timing of restrictions across states also helps avoid simultaneous import surges. Overall, the four weekly fractions per origin state sum exactly to one, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant while optimizing temporal distribution to minimize epidemic impact."

The infection pressure is moderate, and imported infected individuals can be roughly estimated as Flow*ft*(I/S). Given the steady but not rapidly increasing infections, a strict-first traffic control pattern is chosen to reduce early imported infections. The first two weeks have stricter controls (lower fractions) to curb initial inflows and potential seeding, while slightly relaxing in later weeks as infections potentially decrease. This balances epidemic control by front-loading restrictions to prevent case surges while allowing some mobility recovery over time. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.35+0.30+0.20+0.15=1.00)."

Considering this, an even distribution of traffic control is chosen to maintain consistent moderate restrictions across all weeks, avoiding abrupt changes that could destabilize control efforts. The imported infected estimate uses Flow*ft*(I/S), and equal fractions reduce sudden spikes in imported cases.

For states with steadier infection levels or lower relative prevalence, such as Arizona, Michigan, Ohio, Texas, and Wisconsin, an even traffic allocation pattern is used to maintain consistent moderate restrictions, preventing sudden surges in imported infections and balancing epidemic control with mobility needs. States with fluctuating or moderate infection pressure and high mobility demands, such as Indiana, receive a relaxed-first pattern to allow some early mobility, adjusting restrictions in later weeks based on epidemic trends. Quantitatively, the imported infection risk from each state is roughly proportional to the product of inbound flow, fraction of weekly flow, and the ratio of infected individuals to susceptible population (Flow*ft*(I/S)). By adjusting the fractions, the strategy reduces imported infections during the periods of highest infection prevalence in the origin states, thus flattening the influx of infectious individuals. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls may be needed across more states, while reductions in beta or I would allow more relaxed mobility. Coordination across states balances imported infection risk over time, avoiding overwhelming Nebraska's healthcare capacity.

    "notes": "Alabama has a large susceptible population (4.8M) and relatively low exposed (1285) and infected (406) individuals compared to its population, indicating moderate risk. Given the moderate I proportion (406/total ~ low), imported infections scale roughly with inbound flow * fraction * (I/total_pop). The inbound flow average is 826.7 daily. We apply a strict-first pattern, allocating lower fractions in the first two weeks (0.30, 0.25) to reduce initial seeding, then gradually relaxing controls. This balances early suppression of importation with later mobility needs. The sum of fractions is exactly 1.0, ensuring total flow constancy."

  "global_guidance": "The traffic control policy across all origin states adopts a strict-first pattern, prioritizing stronger restrictions in the initial weeks and gradually relaxing over the 4-week horizon. This approach strategically reduces early importation of infections, which is critical to minimizing the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Nebraska. Since imported infections approximately scale with inbound flow multiplied by the fraction allocated that week and the prevalence of infected individuals (I/population) in the origin state, allocating lower fractions early when infection pressure is high reduces seeding risk. The total inbound flow from each origin state is conserved by ensuring the sum of fractions equals exactly one, adhering to the ground truth constraints. Cross-state coordination thus balances varying infection prevalences and mobility volumes by tailoring week-wise restrictions, resulting in a combined effect of dampening early epidemic intensification while allowing some mobility recovery later. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, the strict-first approach is even more justified to prevent early surge in imported cases. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, fractions can be more evenly distributed.

States with lower infection pressure or very high flow volumes (e.g., Iowa) have slightly relaxed-first or balanced patterns to maintain mobility while not dramatically increasing risk. Quantitatively, since imported infections scale approximately as Flow*ft*(I/Population), reducing ft in early weeks for higher-risk states substantially lowers immediate imported cases, which have outsized influence on cumulative infections and deaths due to nonlinear epidemic dynamics (beta=0.115). The cooperation logic balances flow reductions across states and weeks, avoiding excessive restrictions that could impair socio-economic activity. By spreading some flow to later weeks with less prevalence risk or higher Nebraska immunity, overall importation risk is managed dynamically. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates rise, stricter early controls become even more critical, while if local immunity in Nebraska grows, later relaxation can be accelerated. This policy thus adapts to evolving epidemic conditions, balancing epidemic control with mobility needs to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Nebraska."

The expected imported infections can be approximated as imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population), where population is the sum of compartments.

  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic allocation strategy prioritizes reducing early-week imported infections from origin states with high infection prevalence and large inflows to Nebraska. By applying strict-first patterns to states like Iowa, Alabama, Indiana, and Tennessee, which have either high infected counts or large daily inflows, early seeding of infections in Nebraska is minimized, slowing epidemic growth. States with moderate or stable infection levels and inflows, such as Arkansas and New Mexico, are assigned even distribution patterns to maintain balanced epidemic control and economic activity. Relaxed-first patterns are reserved for states like Idaho and Utah, where infection prevalence is high but inflows are moderate, allowing some early mobility but tightening control during peak infection periods. This staggered approach balances the trade-off between minimizing imported infections and preserving mobility. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections per week are proportional to the product of the origin state's inflow, weekly fraction, and infection prevalence (I/population). By front-loading stricter controls in weeks where importing infections would be more detrimental to Nebraska's epidemic dynamics, the policy reduces cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. The sensitivity of this strategy depends on accurate prevalence and transmission rates; if infection rates increase, stricter front-loaded controls become even more critical. Conversely, if beta or infection prevalence declines, mobility can be relaxed earlier without risking epidemic resurgence. This cooperative approach across states ensures that weekly traffic proportions sum to 1 per origin, preserving total flow while optimizing temporal distribution to minimize epidemic impact in Nebraska."

By applying strict-first patterns to states like Iowa, Alabama, Indiana, and Tennessee, which have either high infected counts or large daily inflows, early seeding of infections in Nebraska is minimized, slowing epidemic growth. States with moderate or stable infection levels and inflows, such as Arkansas and New Mexico, are assigned even distribution patterns to maintain balanced epidemic control and economic activity. Relaxed-first patterns are reserved for states like Idaho and Utah, where infection prevalence is high but inflows are moderate, allowing some early mobility but tightening control during peak infection periods. This staggered approach balances the trade-off between minimizing imported infections and preserving mobility. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections per week are proportional to the product of the origin state's inflow, weekly fraction, and infection prevalence (I/population). By front-loading stricter controls in weeks where importing infections would be more detrimental to Nebraska's epidemic dynamics, the policy reduces cumulative confirmed and deceased cases.

States with higher infection prevalence (I and E) and moderate to high inflow volumes adopt stricter controls early in the 4-week horizon (strict-first pattern), reducing imported infections when transmission risk is highest. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or very large susceptible populations but lower infected counts tend to receive even or relaxed-first patterns, spreading risk and maintaining mobility to avoid economic disruption. Quantitatively, imported infections from each state are proportional to Flow * ft * (I / population), so adjusting weekly fractions ft modulates weekly imported infection load without changing total inbound volume. This temporal balancing reduces pressure on healthcare and allows for adaptive response. Sensitivity to epidemiological parameters like transmission rate beta or prevalence changes is addressed by ensuring stricter early controls for states with rising infections or higher beta, while relaxing later weeks as local control improves. Conversely, if prevalence falls, fractions could be flattened to increase mobility. This cooperative, state-specific, and dynamic approach optimizes epidemic control while respecting mobility needs, validated by exact fraction sums and epidemiological reasoning for each state.'
