The imported infections roughly scale with Flow*ft*(I/population), so with a large population and low infection prevalence, the risk is moderate. The inbound flow is substantial (12930.5 daily), so adjusting weekly fractions can manage importation risk. Infection pressure is stable; thus, an even distribution (equal fractions) avoids spikes in any week, balancing mobility and control. This evenly spread pattern ensures consistent control without overly restricting mobility in any single week. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.25*4=1), validating the allocation."

Given the lower inflow (2460.25) and moderate infections, we can slightly relax controls early (weeks 1 and 2) to preserve mobility but tighten later weeks to prevent late surges. The imported infections estimate as Flow*ft*(I/population), so front-loading fractions helps balance import risk. The pattern is relaxed-first, reflecting a desire to allow more mobility early but anticipating potential infection growth. Trade-offs include slight risk increase early but benefit to economic activity. The fractions sum to 1 (0.3+0.3+0.2+0.2=1), confirming validity."

  "global_guidance": "Considering all origin states collectively, the traffic control policy aims to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in South Carolina by strategically allocating inbound traffic fractions over the next four weeks. States with higher infection prevalence (high I and E relative to population) and significant inbound flow are assigned stricter controls early (strict-first pattern), reducing importation risk when infection pressure is greatest. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller flows are often allocated relaxed-first or even patterns to maintain economic activity while managing risk. The key quantitative logic is that imported infections scale approximately with Flow*ft*(I/population), where Flow is daily average inbound traffic and ft is the fraction for week t. By shifting fractions to lower values in weeks with higher infection risk, the policy reduces expected imported infections and downstream transmissions. Cross-state cooperation ensures that weeks with higher imported risk from one state are offset by stricter controls from others, smoothing overall importation risk. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become more critical; conversely, if beta decreases or prevalence drops, more relaxed patterns can be justified. The overall approach balances epidemic control with mobility needs, ensuring fractions for each state sum exactly to 1, preserving total inbound flow volume while redistributing it temporally to minimize disease spread."

States with higher infection prevalence (high I and E relative to population) and significant inbound flow are assigned stricter controls early (strict-first pattern), reducing importation risk when infection pressure is greatest. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller flows are often allocated relaxed-first or even patterns to maintain economic activity while managing risk. The key quantitative logic is that imported infections scale approximately with Flow*ft*(I/population), where Flow is daily average inbound traffic and ft is the fraction for week t.

With an average daily inflow of 16798.18, the expected imported infections roughly scale with the product Flow*ft*(I/population). Maintaining a strict-first pattern (lower fractions in earlier weeks) helps minimize immediate imported infections when local risk is likely higher, gradually relaxing controls as the situation improves or the epidemic progresses. This approach balances epidemic control by reducing early imported cases, which are more dangerous for triggering outbreaks, while allowing some mobility later. The sum of fractions is exactly 1, validating the allocation."

Given the moderate infection pressure and inflow of 2944.71, an even distribution of traffic (all fractions equal) is chosen to avoid spikes in imported cases and maintain steady control. The formula imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population) suggests that fluctuating controls may not significantly reduce risk due to relatively balanced prevalence.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic control policies collectively prioritize reducing early imported infections from states with higher infection and exposure levels while maintaining reasonable mobility for economic and social activities. The general strategy is to apply stricter controls in the first one or two weeks (strict-first pattern) for states with higher risk (higher I and E relative to their populations) to minimize early seeding of infections in South Carolina. For states with moderate or low infection pressure, an even distribution pattern balances epidemic control and mobility, preventing sudden surges of imported infections. This coordinated approach effectively lowers cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by controlling the timing and volume of inbound flow. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections from a state scale with the formula: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population), where ft is the fraction allocated to week t. By reducing ft in early weeks for high-risk states, imported infections during the critical early period decrease, curbing epidemic growth. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more essential to prevent overwhelming local health systems. Conversely, if prevalence declines, policies can be relaxed earlier to support economic recovery. This dynamic allocation leverages both spatial and temporal risk variations to optimize epidemic control across states. The fractions for each state sum exactly to 1, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant while adjusting timing. This policy framework thus balances epidemic control imperatives with mobility needs effectively in South Carolina."

    "notes": "Alabama's average past 28-day population shows a moderate infection level with I=426 and E=1360 out of a large susceptible population (S=4856818). The imported infections can be roughly estimated as Flow * ft * (I / population), where population is the sum of S, E, I, Q, R, D (~4870000). Alabama's infection prevalence is moderate, and past inflow is steady. Given this, an even distribution (even pattern) over 4 weeks is chosen to balance mobility and epidemic control. Strict-first might disrupt economic activities unnecessarily, and relaxed-first could cause spikes in imported infections. The fractions sum to exactly 1.0, ensuring total inflow remains constant while evenly spreading risk."

    "notes": "Arizona has a higher exposed count (E=2988) and moderate infected (I=905) relative to its population (~7.2 million susceptible). Imported infected roughly scale with Flow * ft * (I/population). Given the relatively higher exposure and infection, a strict-first pattern is adopted: stricter controls in the first two weeks (lower fractions in later weeks) to immediately reduce imported infections early, then gradually relax. This pattern helps in lowering the initial infection pressure on South Carolina. The total fractions sum to 1 exactly, maintaining overall inflow stability."

A balanced approach between strict-first and relaxed-first is chosen, slightly stricter in the first and last week, relaxed in the middle weeks, to mitigate sudden surges while allowing some mobility.

  "global_guidance": "The collective allocation of inbound traffic fractions across origin states aims to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in South Carolina by adjusting weekly traffic flows based on infection pressure. States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to their susceptible populations adopt a strict-first pattern, imposing stricter controls in the initial weeks to reduce the importation of infectious individuals early and prevent seeding outbreaks in South Carolina. This is particularly important for large states with high prevalence such as Michigan, Ohio, Texas, and Indiana. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure or moderate levels employ even or balanced patterns, distributing traffic evenly or slightly relaxing controls mid-period to maintain economic activity while managing risk. The quantitative logic underpinning these decisions relies on the proportionality of imported infected individuals to the product of inbound flow, the weekly fraction, and the infection prevalence (I/population). By maintaining the total 4-week inflow constant but shifting weekly proportions, the policy smooths the infection risk over time, reducing peak importation potential. This cooperative cross-state strategy ensures that no single week or state overloads South Carolina's epidemic control capacity, while allowing some flexibility for mobility needs. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase in origin states, stricter-first patterns and lower initial weekly fractions become more critical, whereas lower prevalence permits more even distributions. The allocations are carefully validated to sum to exactly 1 for each state, preserving total expected inbound flow and ensuring consistency with ground truth mobility baselines."

Imported infections roughly scale as Flow * ft * (I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)), so controlling early weeks can reduce initial case seeding in South Carolina. Given a stable but non-negligible infection pressure, a strict-first pattern is chosen: lower inbound flow fractions in the first two weeks (0.20, 0.25) ramping up gradually as risk presumably declines or can be managed (0.30, 0.25).

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocations prioritize mitigating early importation risks into South Carolina by implementing stricter inbound controls in the initial weeks from states with higher infection prevalence and larger flows. States like Ohio, Michigan, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Indiana with high infected and exposed counts and large traffic volumes receive a strict-first pattern with lower fractions in weeks 1 and 2, gradually relaxing controls in weeks 3 and 4. This frontloading of control reduces the immediate seeding of cases, thereby lowering cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. Conversely, states with lower infected counts or lower inbound flows are assigned even or mildly strict-first patterns to balance epidemic risk and mobility. The total inbound flow over 4 weeks per origin state remains constant to preserve overall travel demand. The balancing across states and weeks allows South Carolina to reduce cumulative disease burden by dampening early introductions while gradually restoring economic activity. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter and longer frontloaded control would be warranted; conversely, if prevalence drops or vaccination coverage increases, controls could be relaxed earlier. This cooperative allocation approach optimizes risk distribution over time and origin states, minimizing sudden spikes in imported infections and allowing the healthcare system to better manage cases. The patterns collectively ensure that the sum of weekly fractions per state is exactly 1, preserving inbound flow consistency while prioritizing epidemic control."

Imported infected cases can be approximated by Flow * ft * (I / population), where Flow is the average inbound flow and ft the weekly fraction. The flow is quite large (~10,622 daily), so controlling early weeks can significantly reduce imported infections.

  "global_guidance": "In establishing these inbound flow fraction allocations for South Carolina, the collective strategy prioritizes reducing the cumulative imported infections and subsequent confirmed and deceased cases. States with higher infection prevalence (ratio of infected I to susceptible S) and larger inbound flows receive stricter control earlier in the 4-week period (strict-first pattern), which effectively lowers early imported infection pressure when the epidemic is most sensitive to new introductions. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or smaller inflows adopt more relaxed-first or even distributions to maintain economic mobility without significantly increasing infection risk. The overall approach balances the total inbound traffic over 4 weeks to remain constant, ensuring no net economic disruption from volume reduction but instead shifting temporal distribution to minimize risk. Quantitatively, expected imported infections from state i at week t scale as Flow_i * f_t * (I_i / Population_i), so lowering f_t in weeks with high infection prevalence is critical. Cooperation across states involves allocating stricter controls in weeks where multiple states exhibit high infection pressure, thus synergistically reducing risk. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become even more critical, whereas lower beta or prevalence permits more relaxed allocations. This adaptive, data-driven allocation reduces overall epidemic burden while preserving mobility and economic activity, validated by the exact sum of fractions to 1 for each origin state."

The infection pressure from Alabama is modest, and the inbound flow to South Carolina is moderate (daily average ~10,933). The imported infected can be estimated roughly as Flow*ft*(I/Population), indicating risk scales with both flow and infected prevalence. Given the steady infection levels and moderate inflow, an even distribution of traffic over the next 4 weeks is chosen to balance mobility and control, avoiding sudden spikes in imported cases.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies strategically distribute inbound flows over the next 4 weeks for each origin state to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in South Carolina. States with higher infection prevalence (I and E) and moderate to high inbound flows are assigned stricter controls in earlier weeks (lower fractions) to reduce immediate imported infection pressure, which is proportional to Flow*ft*(I/Population). This front-loaded control reduces seeding of new cases and limits exponential growth locally. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller inbound flows are allocated more relaxed early weeks to balance economic and social mobility needs, with tighter controls later as a precaution. This staggered temporal distribution (strict-first or relaxed-first patterns) across origin states collectively lowers peak importation risk and spreads mobility impacts over time. Quantitatively, this cooperation among states balances cumulative infection importation rates, considering both prevalence and flow magnitude, and respects total flow constraints (fractions sum to 1). Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more critical, whereas lower prevalence permits more even or relaxed allocations. The policies thus provide robustness against epidemiological uncertainties and mobility demands, optimizing public health outcomes while sustaining essential travel.

States with higher infection prevalence (I and E) and moderate to high inbound flows are assigned stricter controls in earlier weeks (lower fractions) to reduce immediate imported infection pressure, which is proportional to Flow*ft*(I/Population). This front-loaded control reduces seeding of new cases and limits exponential growth locally. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller inbound flows are allocated more relaxed early weeks to balance economic and social mobility needs, with tighter controls later as a precaution. This staggered temporal distribution (strict-first or relaxed-first patterns) across origin states collectively lowers peak importation risk and spreads mobility impacts over time. Quantitatively, this cooperation among states balances cumulative infection importation rates, considering both prevalence and flow magnitude, and respects total flow constraints (fractions sum to 1). Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more critical, whereas lower prevalence permits more even or relaxed allocations. The policies thus provide robustness against epidemiological uncertainties and mobility demands, optimizing public health outcomes while sustaining essential travel. This coordinated approach supports epidemic control in South Carolina by minimizing imported infections and subsequent local transmission, critical for managing healthcare capacity and reducing mortality.'

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies for South Carolina focus on minimizing imported infections by adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions from each origin state while keeping total 4-week inflow constant. States with higher infection prevalence (I/S ratio) and/or smaller susceptible populations are assigned a strict-first pattern, enforcing more stringent controls in the earlier weeks to reduce immediate importation risk. This delays potential spikes in South Carolina's local epidemic and allows time for case management. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or very large susceptible populations receive more balanced or even allocations, reflecting lower importation risk. Across states, the strict-first approach is common, reflecting the priority to reduce early infection importation, which has a disproportionate effect on downstream cases and deaths due to epidemic growth dynamics. The fractions precisely sum to 1 for each state, ensuring flow conservation. Quantitatively, imported infections are approximately proportional to inbound flow times the infectious prevalence in origin states, modulated by the weekly fraction ft. By reducing ft in weeks with higher infection pressure, the policy effectively lowers expected imported cases. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence increases or transmission parameters (e.g., beta) rise, stricter early controls become even more critical to prevent overwhelming South Carolina's health system. Conversely, if prevalence is overestimated, moderate relaxation in early weeks may be justified to alleviate socioeconomic impacts. The coordinated reduction in early weeks across multiple origin states reduces cumulative infection importation, thereby minimizing new local cases and deaths in South Carolina. This multi-state cooperation is essential given interconnected mobility patterns. In summary, the policy balances epidemic control urgency with mobility needs, prioritizing early restrictions where infection risk is highest and relaxing controls as risk diminishes or as local containment improves."

    "notes": "Alabama's average infectious population (I=1053) is relatively low compared to its susceptible population (S=4763319), indicating a moderate infection pressure. The imported infected cases can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / Population), so reducing flow earlier weeks reduces the risk of seeding new infections. Given Alabama's consistent moderate infection levels, a strict-first pattern (higher restrictions early weeks) is chosen to curb early importations and allow local cases to stabilize. This pattern balances epidemic control with mobility by allowing gradual relaxation over weeks. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.40+0.30+0.20+0.10=1)."

The imported infected cases scale with Flow * ft * (I / Population), so early restrictions reduce immediate transmission risk. Arizona's infection pressure shows a slight decrease trend, justifying a strict-first pattern to contain early importations, easing restrictions later as risks decrease.

  "global_guidance": "The overall traffic control strategy across origin states employs predominantly a strict-first pattern, prioritizing stronger restrictions in the initial weeks and gradual relaxation later. This approach exploits the nonlinear effects of early importation reductions on the epidemic trajectory in South Carolina, as early seeding events can spark larger outbreaks. By concentrating restrictions upfront, the policy minimizes cumulative imported infections and subsequent confirmed and deceased cases. The use of proportional fractions ensures total inbound flow remains constant over the four weeks, preserving economic and social mobility in aggregate while shifting temporal risk. States with higher infectious prevalence, such as Utah, Idaho, Ohio, and Michigan, receive more stringent early restrictions, reflecting their elevated transmission risk. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure, e.g., Kentucky and Nebraska, have somewhat more balanced fractions, but still favor early control to prevent importation chains. Quantitative cooperation logic leverages the fact that reducing flow in high-risk weeks and states substantially lowers expected imported infections (estimated by Flow * ft * (I / Population)), thus optimizing the distribution of restrictions to maximally reduce epidemic impact. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase in specific states, the model would intensify early restrictions for those states to counterbalance heightened risk. Conversely, if prevalence declines, restrictions could be eased earlier to restore mobility. This dynamic allocation of control balances public health priorities with socio-economic needs, aiming for minimal epidemic impact in South Carolina while maintaining overall inbound flow volume."
