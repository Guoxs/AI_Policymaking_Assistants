  "global_guidance": "The overall traffic control strategy for inbound flows into Wisconsin is designed to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased COVID-19 cases by adjusting weekly inbound traffic proportions while keeping total flow constant. For origin states with higher infection prevalence and exposure, such as South Carolina, Idaho, Michigan, and Arkansas, stricter controls are advised in the early weeks (strict-first or relaxed-first patterns) to reduce immediate importation risk when infection pressure is highest. This limits the seeding of new cases in Wisconsin and helps flatten the epidemic curve. For states with moderate or low infection prevalence but high flow volumes, such as Minnesota, Indiana, and Alabama, an even distribution of traffic across weeks balances epidemic mitigation with economic mobility, avoiding abrupt disruptions to travel while maintaining control. The approach employs the approximate formula for imported infections: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / Population), highlighting the importance of reducing ft during weeks with higher infection prevalence. The weekly fraction allocations sum exactly to 1 for all origin states, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant over the 4 weeks. Coordination across states and weeks ensures that restrictions are not overly concentrated in a single period or state, which could lead to uncontrolled outbreaks or economic backlash. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls would be necessary, whereas declines in these parameters allow more relaxed policies.

For origin states with higher infection prevalence and exposure, such as South Carolina, Idaho, Michigan, and Arkansas, stricter controls are advised in the early weeks (strict-first or relaxed-first patterns) to reduce immediate importation risk when infection pressure is highest. This limits the seeding of new cases in Wisconsin and helps flatten the epidemic curve. For states with moderate or low infection prevalence but high flow volumes, such as Minnesota, Indiana, and Alabama, an even distribution of traffic across weeks balances epidemic mitigation with economic mobility, avoiding abrupt disruptions to travel while maintaining control. The approach employs the approximate formula for imported infections: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / Population), highlighting the importance of reducing ft during weeks with higher infection prevalence. The weekly fraction allocations sum exactly to 1 for all origin states, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant over the 4 weeks. Coordination across states and weeks ensures that restrictions are not overly concentrated in a single period or state, which could lead to uncontrolled outbreaks or economic backlash. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls would be necessary, whereas declines in these parameters allow more relaxed policies. The strategy thus balances epidemic control and mobility, reduces imported infections and deaths, and supports public health sustainability in Wisconsin.'

States with higher infection prevalence (I/S) and large inbound flows receive stricter controls in weeks 1 and 4, reducing early and late importation risk when infection pressure may be higher or less predictable. Relaxed controls in weeks 2 and 3 for many states allow necessary mobility while reducing peak risks. This staggered approach minimizes imported infections that seed local transmission, helping keep Wisconsin's epidemic under control. Quantitatively, imported infections per week per state approximate Flow * fraction * (I/S), so allocating lower fractions to weeks with higher local vulnerability or higher origin prevalence reduces risk. The even patterns for low-risk states maintain steady travel and reduce economic disruption. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early and late controls would be necessary, emphasizing flexibility and real-time epidemic monitoring. Coordination across states ensures Wisconsin's total imported infection risk is minimized without disproportionately restricting any single origin, maintaining equitable mobility and epidemic control."

The exposed (E=1,360) and confirmed (Q=11,916) populations indicate ongoing transmission but at moderate levels. Given the daily inflow of 3,689, the imported infected can be estimated as roughly Flow * ft * (I / population). Here, population is approximated by the sum of compartments. To minimize risk, a strict-first pattern is chosen: higher restrictions initially (f1=0.35, f2=0.30), gradually relaxing in weeks 3 and 4. This approach limits early importation of infected travelers when Wisconsin's own infected and exposed counts are high (I=3,191; E=4,174). The trade-off balances epidemic control with maintaining some mobility. The fractions sum to exactly 1.0, ensuring consistent total flow."

Given elevated infectious pressure, a cautious approach with stricter control in the first two weeks (f1=0.30, f2=0.25) followed by moderate relaxation is chosen.

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce expected imported infections and deaths in Wisconsin, the policy enforces stricter traffic control in the initial weeks for states with higher infection prevalence and substantial inflow volumes, such as Michigan, Indiana, Minnesota, and Ohio. This strict-first pattern delays and reduces the number of infected travelers entering Wisconsin when the state's own infection levels are high, thereby curbing the epidemic's spread. States with lower or more stable infection levels and smaller inflows, like Idaho, Nebraska, and Utah, follow an even traffic allocation to maintain mobility while controlling risk. The quantitative cooperation logic balances weekly inflow fractions so the total inbound flow remains constant per origin state, but risk is mitigated by shifting flows away from early weeks with higher infection pressure. This temporal redistribution reduces cumulative infections and deaths by limiting seeding events during Wisconsin's epidemic peak. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls would be warranted, possibly reducing later weeks further. Conversely, if these parameters decrease, a more relaxed pattern could be applied to recover mobility sooner.

This strict-first pattern delays and reduces the number of infected travelers entering Wisconsin when the state's own infection levels are high, thereby curbing the epidemic's spread. States with lower or more stable infection levels and smaller inflows, like Idaho, Nebraska, and Utah, follow an even traffic allocation to maintain mobility while controlling risk. The quantitative cooperation logic balances weekly inflow fractions so the total inbound flow remains constant per origin state, but risk is mitigated by shifting flows away from early weeks with higher infection pressure. This temporal redistribution reduces cumulative infections and deaths by limiting seeding events during Wisconsin's epidemic peak. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls would be warranted, possibly reducing later weeks further. Conversely, if these parameters decrease, a more relaxed pattern could be applied to recover mobility sooner. Thus, this adaptive, data-driven allocation balances epidemic control and socioeconomic considerations, minimizing imported infections while maintaining consistent traffic volumes over the 4 weeks."

The overall risk of imported infection is proportional to daily inbound flow multiplied by the infection prevalence I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D). With an average daily inflow of 4750.2, imported infected cases roughly scale as 4750.2*ft*(406/4876762). Given a decreasing trend in Alabama's infection pressure, we apply a strict-first pattern with higher control at the start (f1=0.35) and gradually relax controls by week 4 (f4=0.15). This strategy reduces initial risk of imported cases when dynamics are more uncertain and allows some mobility recovery later. Trade-offs include some delayed economic activity but better epidemic control. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic control policy for Wisconsin balances epidemic control and mobility by prioritizing strict controls in early weeks for states with higher infection prevalence and flow, progressively relaxing controls as infection pressure decreases or stabilizes. This pattern minimizes cumulative imported infections by reducing early seeding of cases when epidemic dynamics are more sensitive, and later permits economic activity recovery. Cross-state reasoning considers both infection prevalence (I/population) and daily inflow magnitude; states with higher prevalence and larger flows receive stricter early-week controls to reduce imported infectious pressure. Quantitatively, imported infected cases are proportional to daily inflow multiplied by infection prevalence and weekly fraction ft. Distributing ft to reduce early-week importations lowers cumulative infections and deaths in Wisconsin. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence increases or transmission rate beta rises, stricter or longer strict-first controls would be needed to maintain control. Conversely, if prevalence falls or effective reproduction reduces, more relaxed controls could be applied earlier. The even patterns for states with stable infection pressures reflect a balanced approach to maintain steady control without unnecessary mobility restriction. Overall, this coordinated multi-week, multi-state allocation optimizes epidemic mitigation in Wisconsin by minimizing imported infections while considering mobility and economic factors. The fractions sum to exactly 1 for each state, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant, satisfying constraints."

The imported infected estimate is proportional to Flow * ft * (I / Population). Given the fairly stable infection levels and moderate inflow (2866.82 daily), an even distribution pattern is chosen to balance mobility and epidemic control. Strict front-loading or relaxation could create spikes in imported infections or mobility hardship. The fractions sum to exactly 1.

  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic control strategy distributes inbound flows across origin states balancing epidemic risk and mobility. States with higher infected proportions and large inflows, such as Minnesota, Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio, receive stricter early week controls to reduce immediate importation risk, following a strict-first pattern. This front-loading restriction minimizes initial imported infections, reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Wisconsin. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflows use even or relaxed-first patterns to preserve economic and social mobility while maintaining control. The allocation ensures total flow over four weeks remains constant per state, redistributing weekly fractions to flatten infection importation peaks. Quantitatively, imported infections scale with Flow * ft * (I / Population), so adjusting fractions ft modulates risk. This coordinated approach balances the trade-off between epidemic control and mobility, preventing overwhelming imported cases while sustaining essential movement. Sensitivity analysis indicates if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early restrictions become more critical, and relaxed patterns may be less optimal. Conversely, lower prevalence or improved local control could allow more even or relaxed-first patterns, enhancing mobility. The approach is robust to variations yet prioritizes minimizing Wisconsin's epidemic burden via targeted temporal flow controls across multiple origin states."

The risk of importing infections is proportional to the daily inbound flow multiplied by the fraction per week and the ratio of infected to total population (imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population)). Given the moderate infection pressure and the high average daily inflow (~2878), we adopt a strict-first pattern to reduce initial imported infections during weeks 1 and 2, progressively relaxing controls in later weeks as the risk decreases or stabilizes. This approach balances epidemic control by minimizing early imported cases and allowing some mobility recovery later.

Relaxed-first patterns are used for large states with lower per capita infection prevalence but high flow, like Texas and Arizona, balancing economic activity with health risks. This cooperative approach balances the epidemic curve by lowering imported infection pressure during critical early weeks, reducing cumulative cases and deaths in Wisconsin. Quantitatively, imported infections are approximated by Flow*ft*(I/population), so shifting traffic to later weeks with lower infection prevalence or local immunity buildup reduces total imported infections. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence increases or transmission rate beta rises, stricter early controls become even more critical. Conversely, if prevalence drops or vaccination improves, controls can be relaxed earlier. The recommended allocations ensure the sum of fractions equals exactly 1 per origin state, preserving total inbound flow while strategically redistributing weekly proportions to minimize health risks and maintain essential mobility."

The infected fraction is relatively low (I/S ~ 0.0002), indicating moderate risk of importation. The imported infected cases can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population), so restricting flow early reduces early seeding. Given this, a strict-first pattern is applied, with heavier control in the first two weeks (fractions 0.35 and 0.30), progressively relaxing to 0.20 and 0.15 in later weeks, to reduce initial seeding and allow some mobility later. This balances epidemic control by reducing initial risks while gradually restoring mobility. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.35+0.30+0.20+0.15=1.00)."

  "global_guidance": "To reduce cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Wisconsin, the inbound traffic control policy distributes the fixed total inbound flow from each origin state across four weeks with patterns reflecting infection prevalence and population sizes. States with higher infected and exposed counts relative to their susceptible populations and higher baseline inflows (e.g., Michigan, Indiana, Tennessee) adopt a strict-first pattern, concentrating restrictions early to prevent seeding of local outbreaks. States with moderate infection prevalence and large inflows (e.g., Arizona, Iowa, Texas) use even distribution to smooth importation risk and maintain mobility. States with high prevalence but lower inflow (e.g., Utah, Idaho, Minnesota) adopt relaxed-first patterns, allowing some mobility early but increasing control mid-term to reduce delayed peaks. This coordinated approach balances epidemiological risk and mobility needs, minimizing initial importation that can lead to exponential local spread. Quantitatively, imported infected cases scale as Flow * ft * (I/pop), so lowering fractions ft during weeks with higher transmission potential reduces imported cases. Balancing over weeks and states avoids burden spikes on healthcare. Sensitivity analysis shows that if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls or longer strict phases are needed, while if these decrease, more relaxed patterns suffice. The exact fraction sums to 1 for each state ensure the total inbound flow remains constant, preserving overall mobility volume but redistributing temporal flow to optimize epidemic control."

    "notes": "Alabama exhibits a relatively low infection prevalence with I=1053 and E=3404 over a population of approximately 4.76 million, indicating low active and exposed cases ratio. The imported infections into Wisconsin can be approximated by Flow*ft*(I/population), where Flow is the daily inbound flow and ft the fraction for week t. Alabama's daily inflow is moderate (~2839), thus evenly distributing traffic over the 4 weeks minimizes abrupt spikes in imported infection pressure. An even pattern is suitable because Alabama's infection levels are stable without strong upward or downward trends. Stricter control in early weeks could overly constrain mobility without substantial epidemiological benefit, while fully relaxing early risks potential increases. The total fractions sum to exactly 1, confirming valid allocation."

Arizona's daily inflow is significant (~14246), thus slight relaxation in weeks 3 and 4 allows economic activity while early weeks have stricter control to curb initial importation of exposed and infected individuals.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations for Wisconsin optimize epidemic control by modulating weekly fractions for each origin state based on their infection prevalence and inbound flow scale. States with higher infection prevalence relative to population and large inbound flows, such as Arkansas, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, and Utah, are assigned stricter controls in later weeks (strict-first pattern) to minimize cumulative imported infections and deaths by curbing risk as it accumulates. Conversely, states with moderate or stable infection levels and significant flows, like Arizona, Iowa, New Mexico, Texas, and Idaho, receive relaxed-first patterns allowing gradual reopening to balance economic mobility and health protection. States with low infection prevalence and moderate flows, including Alabama, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Virginia, are managed by even traffic allocation to maintain consistent control without excessive restrictions. This cross-state approach reduces peak importation risks by spreading infection pressure uniformly or front-loading restrictions to prevent surges, collectively minimizing transmission within Wisconsin. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections per week are proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), so adjusting ft allows temporal risk balancing. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence (I) or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early-week controls gain importance to preempt outbreaks. Conversely, reductions in prevalence enable more uniform or relaxed allocations. This policy is robust to moderate parameter fluctuations and supports adaptive management by monitoring state-level infection trends and adjusting ft accordingly. Ensuring fractions sum to exactly one for each state maintains total flow consistency, preserving travel demand while strategically timing restrictions to minimize health impacts."
