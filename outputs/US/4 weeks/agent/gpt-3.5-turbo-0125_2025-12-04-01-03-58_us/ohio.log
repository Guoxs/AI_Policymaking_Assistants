    "notes": "Alabama has a large susceptible population (~4.88M) with moderate exposed (1306) and infected (385) individuals relative to population. The infected proportion is low but non-negligible, suggesting moderate transmission risk. Imported infected to Ohio roughly scales as Flow*ft*(I/S+E+I+Q+R+D), thus lowering flow early reduces introduction of cases. The pattern chosen is 'strict-first' with smaller fractions in weeks 3 and 4 to frontload control when risks remain moderate and gradually relax, to balance mobility and control. This reduces early seeding of infections in Ohio, which currently has low I and E but high S. Trade-offs involve reduced mobility early but protection of Ohio's susceptible population. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

The imported infected cases scale with Flow*ft*I/population; thus, stricter control early weeks reduces risk of introducing cases when prevalence is high. The 'strict-first' pattern is chosen to reduce inbound flow in later weeks progressively. Though mobility is constrained early, this protects Ohio's population from importation. Gradual relaxation in week 4 allows some mobility return. Fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

Given this, a pattern slightly relaxed first weeks but stricter mid-period is chosen: a mild 'even' distribution with slightly more weight in week 3 to balance risk and mobility. This approach mitigates peak risk importation while maintaining some mobility. Trade-offs favor avoiding sudden mobility drops that may disrupt economic activity, while still controlling spread.

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy balances epidemic control with economic mobility by allocating inbound traffic fractions across weeks to minimize imported infections and subsequent deaths in Ohio. States with higher infected and exposed prevalence relative to their populations and with large inbound flows to Ohio receive stricter early traffic restrictions ('strict-first' pattern) to reduce seeding of infections during peak transmission risk periods. States with lower prevalence or smaller inbound flows use more balanced or relaxed patterns to maintain mobility while still controlling risk. The cumulative imported infections are approximately proportional to the product of inbound flow, fraction allocated in each week, and the infected proportion in the origin population, i.e., sum over weeks of Flow*ft*(I/population). By front-loading restrictions in weeks 1 and 2 for high-risk states, Ohio reduces early introductions of infection, thereby lowering cumulative cases and deaths. The gradual relaxation in later weeks balances economic activity and public health. Sensitivity analysis shows that if prevalence increases or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter or longer front-loaded restrictions would be needed. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccination/immunity increases, more relaxed allocations can be applied. Coordination across states ensures that reduced flow in one high-risk state is balanced by moderate flow in lower-risk states, maintaining overall mobility while minimizing risk. The exact fractions sum to 1.000 for each state to preserve total inbound flow volume, redistributing traffic timing rather than volume. This dynamic allocation approach is optimal given current epidemiological and mobility data."

Given the large inflow to Ohio (19297.57 daily), the expected imported infections scale as Flow*ft*(I/S), so traffic control directly modulates risk. Alabama's infections are relatively stable, so an even distribution (even pattern) of inbound flow fractions [0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25] balances mobility and epidemic control. Strict front-loading (strict-first) or relaxed-first are less justified without a clear trend in increasing or decreasing infections. Trade-offs favor steady policies to avoid spikes in imported infections. The fractions sum to exactly 1, fulfilling constraints."

To reduce imported infections, slightly stricter control in weeks 3 and 4 (lower fractions) is warranted, assuming infection pressure may increase or stabilize in later weeks. The pattern is a relaxed-first approach to allow mobility early when prevalence may be lower, then tightening later to prevent possible growth of imported infections. This balances epidemic control with economic considerations. The sum of fractions is exactly 1."

The inbound flow is smaller (5247.39 daily), but the risk per traveler is higher. The pattern adopted is a strict-first approach, allocating less traffic in early weeks (0.15 and 0.2) to contain current infectious inflow, then relaxing in weeks 3 and 4 when Ohio's local control can better manage cases. This approach mitigates early seeding of infections from Arkansas, trading off short-term mobility reduction for longer-term epidemic control. The fractions sum to 1."

The chosen pattern is strict-first, with the lowest fraction in week 4, reflecting tightening over time to prevent imported infections as prevalence remains high.

The pattern is even with mild strict-first tendencies to curb peak risk weeks. This balances epidemic control and mobility given Indiana's importance as a source state. Fractions sum to 1."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations for Ohio from its origin states aim to collectively minimize imported infections and subsequent cases and deaths by leveraging the SEIQRD parameters and observed infection prevalence in each origin. By adjusting the weekly fractions while keeping total 4-week inflow constant, we reduce the risk of seeding new infections especially from high prevalence states. States with higher infection prevalence (e.g., Idaho, Utah) receive stricter early controls (lower early fractions) to limit imported infectious individuals when Ohio's local epidemic is vulnerable. Conversely, states with low prevalence and large inflows (e.g., Kentucky, Virginia) have more even fractions to maintain mobility without substantial risk. Patterns like strict-first or relaxed-first are selected based on infection trends and inflow magnitude, balancing epidemic control (reducing importations) and mobility needs (economic and social activity). The quantitative cooperation logic acknowledges that cumulative imported infections scale as sum over states of Flow*ft*(I/S), so distributing flows to later weeks or smoothing them reduces peak risk. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase in origin states, stricter early restrictions or more compressed traffic control (lower fractions earlier) become more critical. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, relaxed-first or even patterns may be more efficient. Overall, this policy balances epidemic control and mobility by temporally staggering inbound traffic from higher-risk states and maintaining steady flow from lower-risk origins, minimizing Ohio's cumulative confirmed and deceased cases over the next month."

    "notes": "Alabama has a moderate number of exposed (1360) and infected (426) individuals relative to its susceptible population of approximately 4.86 million. The imported infected cases can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population) = 22066.93 * ft * (426 / 4856818). Given the relatively low infection prevalence, a balanced traffic allocation pattern (even) is chosen to maintain mobility while controlling risk. Spreading inbound flows evenly over the 4 weeks minimizes abrupt spikes in imported infections and allows for consistent monitoring. This approach balances epidemic control and economic activity without overburdening any specific week with travel restrictions. The sum of fractions is 1.000, validating the allocation."

Imported infected cases scale as 9376.46 * ft * (905 / 7195917). To mitigate risk while considering mobility, a relaxed-first pattern is applied, allowing slightly higher traffic in weeks 2 and 3 when infections may be monitored and controlled better, and stricter control at the beginning and end to prevent new outbreaks. This pattern helps balance disease control and economic needs. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively minimize imported infections and deaths in Ohio, it is critical to harmonize traffic allocations across all origin states based on their epidemic risk profiles and population sizes. States with high infected and exposed counts relative to their susceptible populations pose elevated importation risks; thus, stricter early-week controls (strict-first patterns) are applied to these states (e.g., Indiana, Michigan, Tennessee) to sharply reduce initial imported infections. This front-loading of control allows Ohio to mitigate early seeding of cases and better manage the epidemic trajectory. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence and risk are given more balanced or relaxed-first patterns, permitting some mobility early or mid-period with gradual tightening to maintain control without undue economic disruption. The allocation strategy respects the total inbound flow constraint by redistributing traffic within the 4-week horizon, not reducing total volume, thereby preserving essential mobility while strategically timing restrictions for maximal epidemic benefit. This approach leverages quantitative cooperation logic: by staggering traffic peaks away from high-risk periods and locations, Ohio reduces simultaneous importation surges, which could overwhelm local health systems. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase in any origin state, stricter or prolonged traffic controls would be warranted to prevent spikes in imported infections. Conversely, improved epidemic control in origin states would allow more relaxed inbound traffic distributions. Overall, this coordinated, risk-based, temporal traffic allocation balances public health imperatives with economic and social mobility needs, optimizing Ohio's epidemic control outcomes during the next 4 weeks."

  "global_guidance": "The traffic control policy recommendations are based on carefully balancing the infection risk from each origin state to Ohio by analyzing their SEIQRD compartments and population size, alongside their average inbound flows. States with higher infected and exposed populations (e.g., Michigan, Indiana, Tennessee, Utah) are assigned stricter controls in early weeks (strict-first pattern) to reduce the initial influx of infectious individuals, thereby lowering the risk of seeding new infections in Ohio and preventing early epidemic surges. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller populations adopt more even or relaxed-first patterns, easing restrictions in later weeks to support economic activity while maintaining sufficient control early on. This staged approach across all origin states ensures that the total inbound flow over four weeks remains constant, preserving mobility baselines crucial for economic and logistic stability. The use of weekly fractions summing exactly to one for each origin state enables precise distribution of traffic to minimize overlapping peaks of infectious importation. Quantitative reasoning relies on the approximation that imported infected individuals are proportional to the product of inbound flow, weekly fraction, and infection prevalence (I / total population) in each origin state. By allocating stricter controls in weeks where infectious prevalence is higher or more uncertain, the policy reduces cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Ohio. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if transmission rates (beta) or exposed/infected proportions change, the balance between strict-first and relaxed-first patterns may shift accordingly, emphasizing the need for continuous monitoring and dynamic adjustment. The coordinated approach ensures collective risk balancing, avoiding overburdening specific weeks or states, and optimizing the trade-off between epidemic control and essential mobility."

Given the large inbound flow to Ohio (8851.4 daily on average), the expected imported infections are proportional to Flow * ft * (I / population), where population ~ total state population. Since infection prevalence is stable and low, an even traffic allocation (equal fractions) is selected to balance mobility and epidemic control.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic control policy across origin states aims to collectively minimize imported infections and subsequent cases and deaths in Ohio by strategically allocating inbound traffic fractions over the next 4 weeks. States with higher infection prevalence (I/population) and larger flows to Ohio receive stricter controls in earlier weeks (lower fractions) to minimize early importation risk when Ohio's own infection levels are significant. This relaxed-first pattern (gradual increase in fractions) is dominant in high-risk states such as Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Texas, Tennessee, and Virginia to reduce cumulative epidemic burden. For states with lower or stable prevalence and smaller flows, even distributions are employed to maintain steady mobility without abrupt policy shifts. A few states with moderate prevalence and flow select strict-first patterns to reduce risk later, anticipating epidemic improvements or Ohio's increased control capacity. Quantitatively, imported infections are roughly proportional to Flow * ft * (I/population), so shifting fractions to later weeks when incidence may be lower reduces cumulative importation. The policy balances epidemic control and mobility by avoiding overly stringent restrictions that would severely impact economic activity while prioritizing early risk reduction. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls would be more beneficial, while if prevalence decreases, relaxing controls sooner could be optimal. The current allocation ensures total 4-week inbound flow matches ground truth by summing fractions to exactly 1 for each state. This coordinated approach leverages cross-state differences in epidemic dynamics and mobility volumes to optimize Ohio's epidemic trajectory and public health outcomes."

States with higher infection prevalence (I/population) and larger flows to Ohio receive stricter controls in earlier weeks (lower fractions) to minimize early importation risk when Ohio's own infection levels are significant. This relaxed-first pattern (gradual increase in fractions) is dominant in high-risk states such as Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Texas, Tennessee, and Virginia to reduce cumulative epidemic burden. For states with lower or stable prevalence and smaller flows, even distributions are employed to maintain steady mobility without abrupt policy shifts. A few states with moderate prevalence and flow select strict-first patterns to reduce risk later, anticipating epidemic improvements or Ohio's increased control capacity. Quantitatively, imported infections are roughly proportional to Flow * ft * (I/population), so shifting fractions to later weeks when incidence may be lower reduces cumulative importation. The policy balances epidemic control and mobility by avoiding overly stringent restrictions that would severely impact economic activity while prioritizing early risk reduction. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls would be more beneficial, while if prevalence decreases, relaxing controls sooner could be optimal. The current allocation ensures total 4-week inbound flow matches ground truth by summing fractions to exactly 1 for each state. This coordinated approach leverages cross-state differences in epidemic dynamics and mobility volumes to optimize Ohio's epidemic trajectory and public health outcomes."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce expected imported infections and subsequent deaths in Ohio, we allocate inbound traffic fractions emphasizing strict control during the initial weeks (strict-first pattern) for most origin states, particularly those with high infected and exposed prevalence or high daily inflow. This approach minimizes the initial seeding of infections, which is crucial given the exponential nature of epidemic spread. The imported infected cases scale roughly with Flow*ft*(I/Population), so reducing ft in early weeks for high-risk states directly reduces imported infections. States with very high inflows to Ohio (Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky) receive the strictest early controls to mitigate their disproportionate risk. Conversely, states with lower infected prevalence or inflow get moderately relaxed controls but still follow a conservative approach to avoid risk accumulation. The weekly allocation sums to 1 for all states, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant, preserving economic activity but reshaping it temporally to reduce health risks. Quantitative cooperation logic balances risk across weeks and states, smoothing flows to avoid overwhelming Ohio's capacity to manage new cases. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates were higher, even stricter early controls would be warranted; conversely, lower prevalence might allow more balanced or relaxed distributions. This policy dynamically adapts to the heterogeneous epidemic landscape, prioritizing early disruption of importation chains to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Ohio."

The infection prevalence (I/S) is low, suggesting moderate risk. The expected imported infections can be approximated by Flow*ft*(I/population), where a balanced traffic allocation is preferred to avoid sudden spikes. Given the steady infection pressure, an even distribution (0.25 each week) is chosen to balance epidemic control and mobility needs, preventing overload in any single week.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies across origin states emphasize early-week restrictions in states with higher infected and exposed counts relative to their populations, employing 'strict-first' patterns to mitigate early importation risks into Ohio. States with lower infection prevalence or moderate risk adopt even or relaxed-first patterns to balance epidemic control with economic mobility. This coordinated approach minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Ohio by preventing surges of imported infections early on when healthcare and tracing capacities could be overwhelmed. Quantitatively, expected imported infections are proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), so adjusting weekly fractions ft allows temporal risk smoothing while keeping total flow constant. High-risk states have lower ft in early weeks, trading immediate mobility for epidemic gains. Lower-risk states spread flow evenly to maintain economic activity. Cross-state coordination balances the overall imported infection risk to Ohio, preventing simultaneous high inflows from multiple high-prevalence states. Sensitivity analysis suggests if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early restrictions would be needed; conversely, if epidemic wanes, more relaxed schedules could be adopted. This dynamic allocation ensures Ohios epidemic control strategy is responsive, efficient, and preserves essential mobility."

    "notes": "Alabama's current infected (I=1053) relative to its population (around 4.77M susceptible) shows moderate infection pressure. The exposed population (E=3404) also indicates ongoing transmission risk. The expected imported infections can be approximated by Flow * ft * (I / population), so reducing flow early (week 1 and 2) when Ohio's infections are still high helps minimize imported cases. We use a strict-first pattern to front-load restrictions, gradually relaxing over weeks 3 and 4. This balances epidemic control by reducing early imported infections while allowing some mobility later. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000, validating the allocation."

Thus, imported infections risk is high if inbound flow is not controlled. Applying a strict-first pattern reduces inbound flow strongly in week 1 and 2 to minimize early importation.

States such as Arkansas, Idaho, Utah, and Alabama with higher infection pressure receive stricter controls in weeks 1 and 2 (strict-first pattern) to minimize early imported infections, which are critical since early importations can seed exponential growth in Ohio. Conversely, states with lower infection burden or smaller inflow adopt more even or relaxed-first patterns to preserve economic activity while maintaining control. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections from each state in week t can be approximated by Flow * ft * (I / population), guiding the allocation of fractions. The sum of fractions for each state is exactly 1, ensuring the total inbound flow remains constant over the 4 weeks, just redistributed to reduce risk. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls become more valuable to prevent importation-driven outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta lowers, more relaxed patterns could be justified to reduce socio-economic impacts. The staggered and state-specific approach optimizes Ohio's overall epidemic outcome by distributing restrictions temporally and geographically to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases while preserving necessary mobility."
