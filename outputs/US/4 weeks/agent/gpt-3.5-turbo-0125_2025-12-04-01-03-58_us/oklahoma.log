The imported infected cases can be approximated as proportional to Flow * ft * (I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)), so controlling inbound traffic early reduces infection pressure on Oklahoma. Since Alabama's infection pressure is moderate but stable, a strict-first pattern is chosen with more traffic reduction in early weeks (30%, 25%) transitioning to relaxed control later (25%, 20%). This balances epidemic control by slowing early transmissions while gradually restoring mobility. The total fractions sum exactly to 1.0000, ensuring flow conservation."

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic control strategy for Oklahoma balances infection risk reduction with economic and social mobility needs. Across the 19 origin states, the approach prioritizes stricter traffic reductions in the first two weeks for states with higher infection prevalence (higher I and E relative to population), using a strict-first pattern to mitigate early seeding of cases into Oklahoma. States with lower infection pressure or smaller inbound flows employ even distributions to avoid abrupt mobility disruptions. Conversely, some states with very high absolute inbound flows but moderate infection prevalence (e.g., Texas) use relaxed-first patterns, shifting traffic to later weeks, allowing Oklahoma more time to manage incoming cases and adapt local policies. The formula approximating imported infections as Flow * ft * (I/population) guides this allocation, emphasizing reducing ft when infection prevalence is high to limit imported infections. This inter-state cooperation logic balances traffic volumes over four weeks, maintaining total inbound flows constant while temporally redistributing risk. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases in any origin, stricter early controls become more critical to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, if local Oklahoma immunity (R) improves or beta decreases, mobility can be relaxed earlier. The recommended fractions for each state sum exactly to 1.0000, ensuring flow conservation and policy feasibility. This balanced approach aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Oklahoma while sustaining essential mobility."

The imported infected individuals can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/population), meaning higher inflow fractions during weeks with lower I/population ratios increase risk. Given Alabama's steady infection pressure and moderate prevalence, a relaxed-first pattern is chosen, gradually increasing traffic to facilitate economic activity after initial stricter control.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations collectively aim to minimize COVID-19 importation risk into Oklahoma by strategically modulating weekly inbound flow fractions while keeping total flow constant per origin state. States with higher infected proportions relative to susceptible populations, such as Idaho, Utah, and Michigan, adopt stricter control early (low week 1 fractions) followed by gradual relaxation (relaxed-first pattern) to curb immediate importation risk and allow cautious reopening. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or moderate risk, like Arkansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee, maintain even weekly fractions to balance continuous economic activity with epidemic control. The patterns are chosen based on infection pressure trends derived from SEIQRD parameters and population compositions, using the approximate formula imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population). This approach balances epidemic control—limiting imported infections and downstream cases—and mobility—preserving economic and social activity. The weekly fraction sums for each state are precisely 1, ensuring no net increase in total inbound flow, complying with constraints. Quantitatively, shifting traffic away from weeks with higher infection prevalence reduces cumulative imported cases and deaths in Oklahoma. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early-week controls become more critical, potentially shifting more states toward strict-first patterns. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or vaccination improves, more relaxed-first or even patterns could be adopted to restore mobility. The cooperative allocation across states and weeks smooths importation risk, preventing spikes and allowing adaptive response to evolving epidemic dynamics. This strategy integrates epidemiological insights with mobility data to achieve optimal epidemic control and mobility balance."

This balances the trade-off between epidemic control and economic mobility. The imported infections from each origin state are roughly proportional to the product of their inbound flow, the weekly fraction ft, and the infected prevalence (I/population). By reducing ft in early weeks for states with higher I/population ratios, we reduce the immediate importation risk, allowing Oklahoma's healthcare and control systems to better manage cases. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or stable trends can have more even or relaxed-first patterns to avoid unnecessary economic disruption. Cross-state reasoning involves distributing control efforts to avoid simultaneous high inflows from multiple high-risk states that could overwhelm local capacity. Quantitative cooperation logic involves maintaining total inbound flows constant while shifting temporal patterns of flow to flatten importation peaks. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more critical, while if these parameters decrease, more relaxed patterns could be allowed. This approach also considers that delayed importation reduces the risk of secondary outbreaks by allowing vaccination or natural immunity to increase in Oklahoma. The fractions for all states sum to exactly 1, ensuring the total inbound flow remains constant for each origin state. This coordinated temporal and cross-state traffic allocation minimizes the overall epidemic burden in Oklahoma while maintaining necessary mobility."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies across origin states collectively aim to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Oklahoma by strategically balancing epidemic risk and mobility. States with higher infected and exposed populations (e.g., Texas, Ohio, Michigan, Arkansas) adopt a relaxed-first pattern with stricter control in early weeks and relaxation later, effectively reducing peak importations when local health systems are most vulnerable. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure (e.g., Kentucky, Virginia, Alabama) maintain even traffic allocations to sustain stable mobility without risking spikes. Strict-first patterns in some states with moderate infection (e.g., Idaho, Iowa, Nebraska, Utah) reduce early importations when infection prevalence is high, relaxing control as risks decline. This cross-state cooperative approach balances the temporal distribution of imported infections, preventing simultaneous peaks from multiple origin states that could overwhelm Oklahoma's healthcare capacity. Quantitatively, the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population) guides fraction allocations, ensuring total 4-week flow remains constant while weekly fractions adjust to manage risk. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls (lower fractions in early weeks) become more critical, whereas lower prevalence allows more even or relaxed-first patterns. This balanced, data-driven policy portfolio optimizes both epidemic control and economic mobility, reducing cumulative cases and deaths in Oklahoma while accommodating necessary travel flows."

    "notes": "Alabama's population shows moderate exposed (E=1603) and infected (I=500) counts relative to its susceptible population (S=4,834,585). Given the relatively low infection fraction (I/S), the importation risk is moderate. The expected imported infections are proportional to Flow * ft * (I / population), so adjusting fractions can shift risks temporally. We choose a strict-first pattern, applying stricter controls in weeks 1 and 2 (0.30 and 0.25) to reduce early imported infections when local Oklahoma prevalence is still considerable. Relaxation follows in weeks 3 and 4 (0.25 and 0.20) as local controls possibly improve. This balances epidemic control and mobility by frontloading restrictions but allowing some recovery of traffic later. The fractions sum to exactly 1.00, meeting the constraint."

The imported infected cases scale with Flow * ft * (I/S). Given this elevated risk, strict-first control is warranted to protect Oklahoma early. We assign higher restrictions in week 4 (lowest fraction 0.15), progressively relaxing from week 1 (0.35) to week 3 (0.20). This reduces early imported infections, which are most critical to prevent outbreak amplification in Oklahoma. The trade-off favors epidemic control over mobility initially but relaxes later to maintain economic connections. Fractions sum to 1.00 exactly."

Expected imported infections are proportional to Flow * ft * (I/S), which is significant. To minimize risk, we adopt a relaxed-first pattern, with lower restrictions initially (0.10) and increasing traffic allowed later (0.40). This pattern reflects the assumption that initial outbreak control in Oklahoma is critical, but Arkansas may have improving conditions later. The fractions sum to 1.00 precisely.

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic control recommendations for Oklahoma from each origin state are designed to collectively minimize cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths by strategically allocating weekly traffic fractions while keeping total 4-week inflow constant. States with higher infection prevalence (high I and E relative to susceptible S) and/or large inflows (e.g., Texas, Arkansas, Arizona) receive stricter early-week controls (lower fractions in weeks 1-2), following a strict-first pattern to reduce early imported infections when Oklahoma's local infection load remains significant. This frontloaded restriction approach prevents seeding of new outbreaks and allows local epidemic control measures to be more effective. Conversely, states with moderate or low prevalence and inflow are assigned even or relaxed-first patterns, balancing mobility and risk. The weekly fraction allocations sum to exactly one for each state, preserving total inflow volume. Cross-state cooperation is critical: by collectively reducing early imported infection pressure, the risk of exponential growth in Oklahoma decreases, allowing healthcare capacity to manage cases effectively. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early restrictions would be even more critical to prevent surges. Conversely, if local Oklahoma infections decline rapidly, traffic could be progressively relaxed earlier. The allocations maintain a balance between epidemic control and economic considerations, smoothing traffic flows to avoid sharp disruptions while prioritizing public health. This coordinated temporal traffic management leverages epidemiological data and mobility patterns to optimize disease control outcomes for Oklahoma."

The confirmed cases are high (22465), indicating some control but still a risk of transmission. The imported infected can be approximated by Flow * ft * (I / population), so reducing flow early can significantly reduce incoming infections. Given Alabama's infection numbers are moderate but non-negligible, a strict-first pattern is chosen to minimize initial importation of infected cases and reduce the epidemic pressure on Oklahoma in early weeks. The trade-off is balancing economic and social mobility against infection risk; early strict control limits mobility but protects vulnerable susceptible in Oklahoma.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies collectively aim to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Oklahoma by strategically allocating the inbound traffic fractions over the next 4 weeks. The key principle is to reduce inbound flow more strictly in earlier weeks ('strict-first' pattern) for most origin states with moderate to high infection prevalence, as early reduction of imported infected cases lowers the seeding of new outbreaks in Oklahoma. States with very high inflows (e.g., Texas, Arkansas) and those with extremely high infection prevalence (e.g., Utah) have either even or slightly relaxed later week allocations to balance economic and social mobility needs. The imported infections are roughly proportional to the product of inbound flow, weekly fraction, and infected prevalence (I/population) of the origin state, so reducing ft in weeks with higher infection risk or volume effectively lowers expected imported infections. By staggering restrictions, we avoid overwhelming economic disruption while prioritizing epidemic control early on. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early control becomes more critical; if prevalence decreases, more relaxed patterns could be feasible. Cross-state coordination ensures that high-risk origin states contribute less flow early, while low-risk states maintain mobility, balancing overall risk. This approach leverages temporal and spatial heterogeneity in infection risk to minimize Oklahoma's epidemic burden."

States with higher infection prevalence (I and E) and large daily inflows, such as Arkansas, Texas, Michigan, and Tennessee, are assigned strict-first patterns, imposing tighter control in the first two weeks to limit early importation risk. This frontloading of restrictions helps prevent seeding new outbreaks early, which is critical given exponential growth potential. For states with lower inflow or moderate infection prevalence, an even allocation is used to balance epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs, avoiding excessive disruption where the marginal epidemic benefit would be limited. The strict-first pattern reflects the urgency of reducing early imported infections when transmission risk is highest, followed by gradual relaxation to support economic recovery and mobility. The trade-offs consider the balance between epidemic control, which reduces cumulative cases and deaths, and the economic impact of mobility restrictions. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission parameters increase, stricter early controls would be more beneficial, while lower prevalence or reduced transmission would support more relaxed traffic allocations. The collective approach ensures that the sum of weekly fractions for each origin state equals exactly 1.00, maintaining the total inbound flow constant over 4 weeks while redistributing flows temporally to optimize epidemic outcomes in Oklahoma. The cooperation across states and weeks allows Oklahoma to strategically reduce imported infections through temporal traffic control without drastically reducing total mobility, balancing public health and economic considerations.'

States with higher infection prevalence (high I and E relative to population) such as Idaho, Utah, Michigan, and Wisconsin are assigned stricter early week controls (strict-first or relaxed-first patterns) to sharply reduce initial imported infections when risk is highest. This early suppression helps prevent epidemic acceleration in Oklahoma. States with moderate or low infection prevalence, or very large populations with relatively low infection rates like Texas and Arkansas, receive even traffic allocation to maintain steady control without disrupting mobility excessively. By distributing flow reductions primarily in the early weeks for high-risk states, the approach leverages the temporal dynamics of epidemic importation risk, reducing cumulative cases and deaths. The sum of fractions for each state is rigorously maintained at exactly 1 to ensure total inbound flow remains constant over the 4 weeks. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection rates rise or transmission parameters (beta) increase, stricter and earlier controls would be more beneficial, whereas if prevalence declines, more relaxed patterns could be adopted to support economic activity. This coordinated policy balances imported infection risk across states and weeks, optimizing epidemic control outcomes while minimizing social and economic disruption."
