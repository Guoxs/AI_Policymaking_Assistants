The high inflow (1929 per day) means imported infected cases are roughly proportional to inflow * fraction * (I/Population). Since Alabama's infection pressure is steady and low, an even traffic allocation pattern is justified to balance mobility and epidemic control. The even fractions sum exactly to 1, preserving total flow. Strict control early or late is unnecessary as infection levels are stable and low, so even distribution minimizes sudden spikes."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policy balances the epidemic control objective of minimizing imported infections while preserving essential mobility between states. States with higher infection prevalence or growing epidemics, such as Idaho, South Carolina, and Wisconsin, receive stricter early restrictions (strict-first or relaxed-first patterns with low initial fractions) to prevent early seeding of infections in Minnesota. States with lower or stable prevalence are assigned even fractions to avoid unnecessary economic disruption and maintain steady mobility. The allocations sum exactly to 1 per origin state, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant while redistributing flow to less risky weeks. This temporal allocation dampens peak imported infection pressure and allows Minnesota's health system to better manage caseloads. The cooperation across states ensures that high mobility from large inflow states with low prevalence (e.g., Iowa) is gradually increased, while those with high prevalence reduce early week flows. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection beta or prevalence increases in origin states, stricter early restrictions would yield greater benefits, whereas if prevalence declines or vaccination increases, more relaxed patterns could be adopted.

States with higher infection prevalence or growing epidemics, such as Idaho, South Carolina, and Wisconsin, receive stricter early restrictions (strict-first or relaxed-first patterns with low initial fractions) to prevent early seeding of infections in Minnesota. States with lower or stable prevalence are assigned even fractions to avoid unnecessary economic disruption and maintain steady mobility. The allocations sum exactly to 1 per origin state, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant while redistributing flow to less risky weeks. This temporal allocation dampens peak imported infection pressure and allows Minnesota's health system to better manage caseloads. The cooperation across states ensures that high mobility from large inflow states with low prevalence (e.g., Iowa) is gradually increased, while those with high prevalence reduce early week flows. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection beta or prevalence increases in origin states, stricter early restrictions would yield greater benefits, whereas if prevalence declines or vaccination increases, more relaxed patterns could be adopted. Overall, this approach leverages infection prevalence and mobility data to optimize weekly traffic flows, minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Minnesota over the next 4 weeks."

Some states with large populations but relatively low infection prevalence (e.g., Texas, Arizona, Wisconsin) use relaxed-first patterns, allowing more flow in later weeks anticipating reduced infection pressure, thus supporting economic activities while mitigating early risk. Quantitatively, expected imported infections scale as Flow*ft*(I/population), so adjusting the weekly fractions ft effectively modulates infection risk importation over time. The traffic allocations sum to exactly 1 per state, preserving total inbound flow but enabling temporal shifts that can reduce cumulative cases and deaths in Minnesota. This coordinated approach leverages temporal risk balancing across states and weeks, reducing peak imported infections and allowing health systems to better manage cases. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early restrictions become more critical to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, if beta or prevalence decrease, more relaxed allocations can be considered to minimize economic disruption. This dynamic, data-driven policy supports epidemic control while sustaining mobility and economic functions in Minnesota."

The imported infections roughly scale as Flow * ft * (I / population), so reducing flow fractions earlier will lower early imported infections and deaths. Infection pressure is relatively stable, slightly decreasing, so a 'strict-first' policy with stricter control in weeks 1 and 2 (0.3 each) and more relaxed weeks 3 and 4 (0.2 each) is optimal. This balances epidemic control by front-loading restrictions to prevent initial seeding while relaxing later as local control improves. The fractions sum to exactly 1, validating the distribution."

Given this, an even distribution of traffic control fractions across the 4 weeks is chosen to maintain consistent moderate control.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies across all origin states emphasize front-loading stricter mobility restrictions within the first two weeks, followed by gradual relaxation in weeks 3 and 4. This 'strict-first' allocation pattern is justified by the SEIQRD epidemiological dynamics, where early reduction of imported infections is critical to prevent seeding and exponential growth within Minnesota. The imported infections from each origin scale approximately as Flow * fraction * (I / S), so reducing fractions when infection prevalence is high yields the most significant reduction in imported cases. States with higher infection prevalence or large inflows, such as Wisconsin, Arkansas, Utah, and Indiana, adopt stronger early restrictions to mitigate risk, while those with more stable or lower prevalence, like Arizona and Texas, maintain even fractions to balance control and economic activity. This collective strategy minimizes cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by concentrating control efforts when they are most impactful and allowing mobility recovery later. Quantitatively, the cooperation logic balances risk across weeks and states, ensuring that total inbound flows remain constant while temporal redistribution reduces peak importation risk. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter front-loading or longer duration restrictions would be advisable to sustain epidemic control. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed or even distributions could be adopted to favor mobility.

This 'strict-first' allocation pattern is justified by the SEIQRD epidemiological dynamics, where early reduction of imported infections is critical to prevent seeding and exponential growth within Minnesota. The imported infections from each origin scale approximately as Flow * fraction * (I / S), so reducing fractions when infection prevalence is high yields the most significant reduction in imported cases. States with higher infection prevalence or large inflows, such as Wisconsin, Arkansas, Utah, and Indiana, adopt stronger early restrictions to mitigate risk, while those with more stable or lower prevalence, like Arizona and Texas, maintain even fractions to balance control and economic activity. This collective strategy minimizes cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by concentrating control efforts when they are most impactful and allowing mobility recovery later. Quantitatively, the cooperation logic balances risk across weeks and states, ensuring that total inbound flows remain constant while temporal redistribution reduces peak importation risk. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter front-loading or longer duration restrictions would be advisable to sustain epidemic control.

The total inbound flow to Minnesota (1573.4 daily) carries a risk of imported infections roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population). Given Alabama's stable infection prevalence and no clear increasing or decreasing trend, an even distribution of traffic control (equal fractions) over the 4 weeks is suitable to maintain a balance between mobility and epidemic control. Lowering flow in some weeks would not significantly reduce risk more than evenly spreading it, given the relatively low infection ratio.

The infection pressure suggests imported infected cases scale with Flow*ft*(I/population). Given the relatively high infections and a plausible increasing trend (higher active Q), stricter control in the early weeks is warranted (lower f1), gradually relaxing later (higher f3,f4).

The fractions follow a 'strict-first' pattern, with stricter control initially (low f1=0.10) ramping up relaxation later to allow mobility as the epidemic risk reduces or Minnesota's internal control improves. This conserves control in early weeks when imported risk is most critical. Fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic control policies for Minnesota emphasize minimizing imported infections by adjusting weekly flow fractions per origin state based on their infection pressure and mobility volume. States with high infected counts and large inbound flows, such as Iowa and Wisconsin, receive stricter early control to reduce initial imported cases when Minnesota's epidemic is vulnerable. This 'strict-first' approach delays potential importation, allowing internal controls to strengthen. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or stabilized trends adopt even or 'relaxed-first' patterns to support mobility without significantly increasing epidemic risk. The sum-to-one constraint for fractions ensures total inbound flow remains constant, preserving travel demand but redistributing temporal risk. Quantitatively, imported infections scale with daily flow, fraction per week, and infected prevalence (Flow*ft*(I/population)). By front-loading stricter controls for high-risk origins, the cumulative imported infections across 4 weeks minimize, reducing secondary cases and deaths in Minnesota. Sensitivity analysis reveals that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter control fractions would need amplification early on or extended in duration to offset higher risk. Conversely, declining prevalence permits more relaxed controls sooner. The cooperative balancing across states prevents overwhelming restrictions on any single origin, maintaining economic and social connectivity while prioritizing epidemic control. This dynamic, data-driven policy mix optimizes cumulative health outcomes for Minnesota over the next month."

The imported infected cases are proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), suggesting that reducing traffic earlier can curb importation. Given a slight decreasing trend in active infections, a strict-first pattern is chosen to frontload restrictions, minimizing risk early on when transmission potential is higher. This approach balances epidemic control by sharply limiting early inflow while allowing gradual relaxation, preserving mobility later. The fractions sum to exactly 1 (0.35+0.30+0.20+0.15=1.0)."

  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic allocation strategy across origin states aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Minnesota by modulating inbound flows based on infection risk profiles of each state. States with high infected and exposed populations, such as Arkansas, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin, adopt strict-first traffic patterns to sharply reduce inflow early when importation risk is highest. This frontloading of control mitigates early seeding of infections in Minnesota. States with moderate or stable infection trends, like Arizona and South Carolina, apply even patterns to balance epidemic control with sustained economic activity. Others with fluctuating or uncertain trends, such as Idaho and New Mexico, employ relaxed-first approaches to cautiously allow initial mobility while preparing for stricter mid-term controls. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections from each state scale with Flow*ft*(I/population), so adjusting ft weekly redistributes infection risk temporally without changing total flow volume, maintaining economic throughput. Cross-state coordination ensures that high-risk states reduce early inflows simultaneously, preventing compounding importation risk, while lower-risk states maintain balanced flows. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) increases, stricter early controls would become optimal, whereas decreases would allow more mobility. The approach is robust to moderate parameter uncertainty by dynamically aligning traffic control intensity with infection dynamics, prioritizing early mitigation to reduce overall epidemic burden in Minnesota."

This front-loading of controls minimizes early seeding and potential outbreaks. States with moderate or lower infection prevalence adopt either even or relaxed-first patterns to balance epidemic control and economic considerations. This cooperative approach mitigates the overall infection pressure on Minnesota by temporally redistributing traffic, preventing large simultaneous influxes of infected travelers. Sensitivity to beta (transmission rate) and prevalence indicates that if infection rates rise, stricter early controls would be more beneficial, while if prevalence declines, a more relaxed or even pattern could be adopted to support mobility. This strategy balances epidemic risk and mobility, ensuring the total 4-week inbound volumes remain constant to avoid economic disruption while strategically timing restrictions to reduce transmission risk. The exact summation of fractions to 1 for each state validates the allocation's consistency and feasibility."

The infected proportion is small, but given the very high average daily inbound flow (2579), imported infections could be significant if not controlled. The expected imported infected cases roughly scale as Flow*ft*(I/Population), indicating that controlling flow fraction in weeks with potentially higher infectiousness can reduce import risks. Given no strong trend in infection pressure changes over time, an even pattern is chosen to maintain a balanced approach, ensuring steady control without overburdening mobility in any week. The trade-off here balances epidemic control with mobility needs for Alabama visitors. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.25+0.25+0.25+0.25=1), validating the allocation."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic control policies collectively aim to minimize imported infections and deaths in Minnesota by strategically allocating traffic flow fractions over the next four weeks. States with higher infection prevalence and higher inbound flow, such as Wisconsin, Arkansas, Michigan, Texas, and Oklahoma, receive stricter control patterns emphasizing reduced flow in early and late weeks to prevent initial seeding and late resurgence of infections. This reduces the importation pressure during critical periods of potential spread. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or lower inbound flow, such as Virginia, Alabama, and South Carolina, apply more balanced or relaxed-first patterns to maintain essential mobility without significantly increasing risk. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections scale with the product of flow, fraction, and infected proportion (Flow*ft*(I/Population)). This relationship guides the fraction allocation to reduce weekly infection pressure while preserving total flow over the month. The cooperation logic balances epidemic risk across states and weeks by distributing stricter controls when infection pressure or flow is high and relaxing controls when risk is moderate or low, optimizing overall epidemic control. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence increases, stricter early and late controls become more critical, while if transmission rates (beta) change, timing and severity of controls should adapt accordingly.

States with higher infection prevalence and higher inbound flow, such as Wisconsin, Arkansas, Michigan, Texas, and Oklahoma, receive stricter control patterns emphasizing reduced flow in early and late weeks to prevent initial seeding and late resurgence of infections. This reduces the importation pressure during critical periods of potential spread. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or lower inbound flow, such as Virginia, Alabama, and South Carolina, apply more balanced or relaxed-first patterns to maintain essential mobility without significantly increasing risk. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections scale with the product of flow, fraction, and infected proportion (Flow*ft*(I/Population)). This relationship guides the fraction allocation to reduce weekly infection pressure while preserving total flow over the month. The cooperation logic balances epidemic risk across states and weeks by distributing stricter controls when infection pressure or flow is high and relaxing controls when risk is moderate or low, optimizing overall epidemic control. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence increases, stricter early and late controls become more critical, while if transmission rates (beta) change, timing and severity of controls should adapt accordingly.
