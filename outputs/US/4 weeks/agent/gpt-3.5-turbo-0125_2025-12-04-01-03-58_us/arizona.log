    "notes": "Alabama shows moderate infection prevalence with I=385 and E=1306 out of a population of approximately 4.89 million, indicating a relatively low infection pressure compared to Arizona. The imported infected cases can be roughly estimated as Flow*ft*(I/population), where Flow is the daily average inbound flow and ft is the weekly fraction. Given Alabama's stable infection rates and moderate flow (~3869 daily average), an even distribution pattern (equal fractions) is chosen for the next four weeks. This balances epidemic control without overly restricting mobility, as strict front-loading or delayed relaxation is not justified by rising or falling trends in infection pressure. The total fractions sum to exactly 1, ensuring the inbound flow volume remains constant over the month."

Given the elevated infected count, a strict-first pattern is adopted by lowering fractions in the first two weeks (0.20 each) and relaxing in the last two weeks (0.30 each). This pattern aims to reduce immediate imported infections during potentially high transmission periods, allowing some mobility relaxation later. The total fractions sum to 1, preserving flow totals. This trade-off sacrifices some mobility early to minimize infection seeding in Arizona while permitting gradual reopening as risk subsides."

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic control policy for Arizona balances epidemic risk mitigation and mobility needs by adjusting weekly fractions for each origin state based on their infection prevalence and flow volumes. States with higher infection pressure (high I and E relative to population) and high inbound flow adopt a relaxed-first or strict-first pattern to reduce immediate infection seeding risk while allowing gradual reopening. This staggers imported infections over time, reducing peak pressure on Arizona's health system. States with lower infection prevalence and moderate flow use even distribution to maintain steady mobility with manageable risk. The total inbound flow from each state remains constant over the four weeks, preserving economic activity while controlling timing of arrivals. This coordinated approach minimizes cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by reducing early imported infections from high-risk states and balancing load across weeks and states. Sensitivity analysis shows that if prevalence increases in any origin state, stricter front-loading would be warranted. Similarly, changes in transmission rate (beta) would affect timing and magnitude of imported infection risk, requiring dynamic adjustments. Therefore, continuous monitoring and adaptive control are critical to respond to evolving epidemic conditions. This policy also considers Arizona's epidemic state to avoid overwhelming local capacity, prioritizing early restrictions on high-risk inbound flows and gradual relaxation as conditions improve."

The exposed (E=1499) and confirmed (Q=14,982) numbers also indicate a moderate infection pressure. Given the large average daily inflow to Arizona, the expected imported infected cases can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / Population), where Flow is 4002 daily. To minimize disease importation, we apply a strict-first pattern, reducing traffic more in the first two weeks (fractions 0.35 and 0.25) when infection risk is higher, then gradually relaxing control as the epidemic possibly declines. This approach balances epidemic control by front-loading restrictions to prevent initial spikes. The fractions sum exactly to 1.0, ensuring constant total inbound flow."

The average daily inflow (5229.93) is substantial. Using the formula for imported infected cases, we see that earlier weeks carry higher risk. The strict-first pattern is chosen to reduce inbound flow initially to curb imported infections, shifting to relaxed control later.

  "global_guidance": "Across all origin states, the recommended allocation patterns prioritize minimizing imported infections into Arizona by adjusting weekly inbound flows while keeping total 4-week inflow constant. States with higher infection prevalence (I and E relative to S) generally receive strict-first patterns to reduce early traffic when risk is greatest, thereby lowering cumulative imported infections and deaths. This front-loading of restrictions prevents seeding new cases early in the period. States with relatively stable or low infection prevalence receive even or relaxed-first allocations to balance epidemic control and mobility needs, mitigating economic and social disruption. The quantitative logic behind allocations is that expected imported infected cases scale with Flow * ft * (I / Population) per week; thus, reducing ft in high-risk weeks lowers importation. The cross-state coordination balances flows temporally and spatially, ensuring no week is overloaded with high-risk inflow from multiple origins simultaneously, which could overwhelm control measures. Sensitivity analysis suggests if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter and earlier controls (lower ft in first weeks) become more critical to prevent exponential growth. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta lowers, more relaxed traffic patterns could be safely adopted. This dynamic allocation approach optimizes epidemic mitigation while preserving essential mobility, tailored to each origin state's epidemic status and flow magnitude. All fractions sum exactly to 1.0, maintaining total inbound flow per origin constant as required."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce imported infections and deaths in Arizona, we allocate inbound traffic from origin states by adjusting weekly flow fractions while keeping total flow constant. States with higher infection and exposure rates relative to their populations, such as Michigan, Texas, Utah, Indiana, and Ohio, are managed with relaxed-first or strict-first patterns that reduce flow in later weeks to mitigate cumulative imported infections. This approach balances epidemic control and mobility by easing restrictions initially and tightening them when infection pressure is anticipated to rise or remain high. States with lower infection prevalence, like Alabama, Iowa, Nebraska, Virginia, and Wisconsin, use even traffic allocation to maintain consistent control without sudden mobility disruptions. This diversified strategy leverages temporal risk variations to minimize importation peak loads and spread risk. Quantitatively, expected imported infected cases scale with Flow*ft*(I/Population), so adjusting ft per week modulates weekly importation risk. The weekly fractions sum to 1 for each origin state, ensuring total inbound flow remains unchanged, preserving economic and social activity levels overall. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter traffic control (lower ft) earlier would be more effective in reducing cumulative cases. Conversely, if prevalence drops, more relaxed traffic distribution can be sustained. Coordinated multi-state traffic control reduces the risk of synchronized importation surges, thereby flattening Arizona's epidemic curve and minimizing deaths."

The daily inbound flow to Arizona is about 3756, which could import infections roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/S+E+I+Q+R+D). Given a fairly stable infection pressure and no significant fluctuations, an even distribution pattern is chosen to avoid sudden spikes or prolonged strict restrictions that could economically or socially impair mobility.

The total inbound flow from each origin state is preserved over 4 weeks to avoid economic disruption, but front-loading restrictions minimizes early infection seeding in Arizona, reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. Quantitatively, imported infections are approximately proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), so lowering fractions in weeks with higher infection prevalence or when epidemic potential is highest reduces risk. Balancing strict controls with relaxed periods limits social and economic impacts while maintaining epidemic control. Sensitivity to beta (transmission rate) and prevalence changes means that if infection rates rise, stricter or longer duration controls would be recommended; conversely, if prevalence decreases, more even or relaxed patterns could be allowed. This coordinated cross-state approach leverages temporal traffic modulation to reduce Arizona's epidemic burden while preserving essential mobility."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control allocation for Arizona's inbound traffic from other states aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically modulating weekly inbound flows based on infection prevalence and mobility patterns. High prevalence origin states (e.g., Idaho, New Mexico, Utah, Michigan, Ohio) receive strict-first patterns with low fractions in initial weeks to reduce early importation of infected individuals, allowing later relaxation as epidemic conditions evolve and local control measures take effect. States with moderate infection levels adopt relaxed-first patterns, gradually increasing flow to balance epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs. Low prevalence states have even or strict-first patterns to maintain baseline control without excessive mobility restrictions. This cross-state coordination reduces the overall imported infection pressure, preventing synchronized peaks of imported cases that could overwhelm local healthcare. Quantitatively, the expected imported infected per week is approximated by Flow * ft * (I/population), thus reducing ft in weeks with higher risk reduces importation risk. The trade-off involves balancing epidemic suppression and economic activity; strict early controls may reduce importation but impact mobility and economy. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early controls become more critical, while lower prevalence allows more relaxed policies. These allocations assume stability in epidemic parameters and population behaviors; changes in beta, or sudden outbreaks, may require revisiting policies dynamically. The sum of fractions per origin state is carefully normalized to 1 to preserve total inbound flow, ensuring fairness and predictability."

The imported infected cases can be estimated as Flow*ft*(I/S), so reducing flow early can significantly decrease initial importation. The past 28-day inflow to Arizona is 3365 daily, with a total 4-week inflow around 94,220. We choose a relaxed-first pattern, gradually increasing flow over weeks since infections are moderate but non-negligible. This approach balances epidemic control and mobility by imposing stricter controls initially to reduce early seeding, then relaxing to accommodate travel demand. The fractions sum exactly to 1.00, validating the distribution."

States with higher infection prevalence (I/S) and significant inflow to Arizona receive stricter early controls (low ft in weeks 1-2) to prevent early outbreak seeding, while states with lower prevalence or inflow have more relaxed or even distributions. This coordinated pattern minimizes cumulative infections by preventing simultaneous imported infection peaks. The quantitative cooperation logic balances flow reductions across weeks and states to keep total inflow constant, preserving mobility needs but shifting timing to manage risk. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence in origin states increases, stricter early controls become more critical, with even lower initial fractions. Conversely, if transmission rate beta decreases, less strict controls may suffice. The allocations' flexibility allows adaptive policy updates as epidemic dynamics evolve, ensuring epidemic control while maintaining essential mobility. The sum-to-one fraction constraint ensures fair and consistent flow management, critical for policy implementation and evaluation."

The imported infected cases can be estimated as imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/S), which for Alabama is non-negligible. Given the moderate infection pressure that doesn't appear to be rapidly increasing or decreasing, a relaxed-first pattern is chosen to allocate more inbound traffic in weeks 3 and 4, allowing some mobility while controlling early week risk. This pattern balances epidemic control and mobility by restricting traffic more in early weeks when risk might be higher, then relaxing controls as the epidemic stabilizes.

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy for inbound traffic control to Arizona is designed to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by balancing epidemic risk and mobility needs across all origin states. By analyzing each state's SEIR composition, especially the infected to susceptible ratio (I/S), we estimate the expected number of imported infected individuals roughly as Flow*ft*(I/S). States with higher infection prevalence such as Michigan, Utah, Indiana, and Wisconsin are assigned stricter controls (lower fractions) in early weeks to reduce seeding risk in Arizona when the local epidemic is still vulnerable. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence like Iowa and Nebraska have more even distributions to maintain mobility consistency. The relaxed-first pattern dominates, reflecting the tendency to impose stricter controls early when risk is higher, then gradually relax controls as the epidemic stabilizes and local immunity increases. This approach leverages temporal risk balancing, reducing early importation shocks while allowing economic and social activities to progressively resume. Cross-state cooperation is implicit in that states with high flows and high prevalence are controlled more strictly initially, offset by relatively relaxed control on lower-risk states, maintaining total inbound flow constant. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) were to increase, early week fractions would need to shift lower to avoid spikes; conversely, if prevalence falls, a more even or relaxed-first approach can be adopted to favor mobility. This calculated allocation ensures that Arizona reduces imported infections and deaths effectively while accommodating necessary population movement."

    "notes": "Alabama's infection prevalence (I=1053) relative to its population (approx 4.8M) indicates moderate risk of importing infected individuals. The expected imported infections scale roughly as Flow * ft * (I / population). Given the large average daily inflow (2697), front-loading strict control (lowest fraction in week 4) reduces immediate importation risk while gradually relaxing control as prevalence decreases. This strict-first pattern balances epidemic control and mobility: initial weeks reduce risk when infection pressure is higher, and later weeks allow increased flow when relative risk is lower. Total fractions sum to exactly 1 (0.40+0.30+0.20+0.10=1), ensuring constant total flow and satisfying constraints."

The inbound flow is moderate (3751 daily). Applying a strict-first pattern with heavier restrictions initially (f1=0.45) minimizes early infection importation, given higher infectious pressure. The risk reduces over time, allowing gradual relaxation. This approach balances reducing early seeding of cases in Arizona with maintaining some mobility.

  "global_guidance": "The overall traffic control strategy across all origin states focuses on minimizing imported infections and deaths in Arizona by adjusting weekly traffic fractions while keeping total 4-week inflow constant. States with higher infection prevalence and larger inflows, such as Arkansas, New Mexico, Tennessee, and Michigan, receive stricter control early (strict-first pattern) to curb immediate importation risk. States with high infection pressure but uncertain trends, like Utah and Wisconsin, receive more even or relaxed-first allocations to balance epidemic control and mobility needs. The quantitative logic follows that imported infections scale with the product of inbound flow, fraction control, and the infected ratio (I/population) in the origin state. By lowering fractions in early weeks for high-risk states, we reduce immediate seeding of cases in Arizona, thus limiting cumulative confirmed and deceased numbers. The sum of fractions per state equals exactly 1, ensuring constant total inflows and compliance with mobility commitments. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more critical, and the patterns may shift to even more front-loaded restrictions. Conversely, if local epidemic control improves in origin states, more relaxed patterns can be adopted to support economic recovery. This coordinated approach balances epidemic risk reduction with necessary mobility, leveraging temporal and spatial variations in epidemic conditions to optimize policies for Arizona's health outcomes."
