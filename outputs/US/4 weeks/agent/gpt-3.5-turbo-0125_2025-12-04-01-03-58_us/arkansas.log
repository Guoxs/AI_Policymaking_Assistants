    "notes": "Alabama has a large susceptible population (4,883,910) and relatively low exposed (1,306) and infected (385) counts compared to its total population. The confirmed cases (14,562) are high but represent quarantined individuals. The death toll is 201, which is moderate. Since infected prevalence is low relative to population, the risk of imported infections is moderate. The imported infections can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I/S+E+I+Q+R+D), indicating that reducing flow fractions in earlier weeks can reduce early imported infections. Here, a relaxed-first pattern is chosen: traffic is more restricted in the first week (0.15 fraction) and gradually relaxed in later weeks (up to 0.30). This approach balances epidemic control by limiting early imported infections when Arkansas's own infection burden is still significant, while gradually allowing more mobility as local control improves. The fractions sum exactly to 1, ensuring the total flow over 4 weeks remains constant."

Confirmed cases are high (29,842), indicating a significant quarantine effect. Deaths (340) are also notable. The risk of importing infections is moderate but not negligible. The pattern chosen is relaxed-first with a moderate initial restriction (0.20), increasing to a peak in week 3 (0.30), then slight relaxation. This allows control of early importation risk while allowing more mobility later when local Arkansas control may be stronger. The fractions sum to 1 exactly."

Confirmed cases (3,786) and deaths (33) are lower but the infection pressure is high. Therefore, a strict-first pattern is chosen, heavily restricting traffic in the first week (0.10) and gradually relaxing over subsequent weeks as infection prevalence hopefully decreases. The imported infection risk is proportional to Flow * ft * (I/population), so early restriction reduces importation. The fractions sum to 1 exactly."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic control policy across origin states has been designed to collectively minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Arkansas by strategically allocating traffic flow fractions across the next four weeks. States with higher infection prevalence (higher I and E relative to total population) such as Idaho, Michigan, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah are assigned a strict-first pattern with low initial traffic fractions (around 0.10) to sharply reduce early imported infections. This helps to suppress potential epidemic seeding early in the period when Arkansas's own epidemic status (E=2230, I=1270) requires cautious management. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or higher quarantine counts (Q) benefit from either relaxed-first or even patterns, allowing mobility to recover later when local epidemic control in Arkansas improves. By balancing traffic restrictions dynamically, the approach mitigates the risk of overwhelming Arkansas's healthcare capacity while not completely shutting down mobility, thus considering economic and social trade-offs. The sum of fractions for each state is rigorously maintained at exactly 1 to keep total inbound flow constant, ensuring fairness and predictability in mobility planning. Quantitatively, the imported infections are roughly proportional to Flow * ft * (I / population), so reducing early ft for high prevalence sources reduces early disease importation, yielding fewer secondary transmissions. Sensitivity to changes in prevalence or transmission rate beta suggests that increasing prevalence would require even stricter early controls, while a lower beta could allow more relaxed policies. Cross-state coordination ensures that high-risk states reduce early flow, while lower-risk states maintain consistent flow, collectively reducing Arkansas's imported infection burden and fatalities across the 28-day period. This policy leverages temporal traffic allocation as a dynamic tool for epidemic mitigation aligned with Arkansas's epidemic parameters and origin states' risk profiles."

Given the steady infection pressure, an even distribution of traffic restrictions over the four weeks is appropriate. The imported infected can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)), so by maintaining equal fractions, we balance mobility and epidemic control. This even allocation avoids sudden surges or drops in traffic, minimizing potential spikes in imported cases while maintaining economic and social activities. The fractions sum exactly to 1, validating the allocation."

The exposed individuals (E=2,097) suggest some ongoing transmission. The inflow is moderate. A slight relaxation in the first two weeks (0.3 each) followed by stricter controls (0.2, 0.2) allows managing the risk as the epidemic might increase due to confirmed cases. Imported infected roughly scale with Flow*ft*(I/population). Front-loading the traffic slightly balances economic needs but reduces risk towards the end when cases may rise.

The inbound flow is small but given the infection prevalence, a relaxed-first pattern (increasing fractions over weeks) is chosen, starting with strict control (0.1) and gradually relaxing to 0.4. This approach aims to suppress early importation of infections and cautiously allow more mobility later as local conditions in Arkansas stabilize.

Given the inflow size, a slightly relaxed-first pattern is recommended to reduce initial imported infections and gradually allow more flow. The infected proportion suggests initial strict control (0.15) to limit immediate risk, then easing (0.25, 0.3, 0.3) as the situation stabilizes.

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the traffic control allocations across origin states aim to minimize imported infections into Arkansas by applying stricter controls in weeks with higher infection prevalence or higher infectious pressure, and relaxing controls in weeks with lower risk. The allocations use the formula imported infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population) as a guiding quantitative tool, balancing the product of traffic flow, fraction allocated, and infection prevalence to reduce overall seeding risk. States with higher infected or exposed proportions and larger inflows (e.g., Oklahoma, Tennessee, Mississippi, Texas) have stricter early week controls to prevent early epidemic seeding, which is critical to avoid exponential growth in Arkansas. States with lower risk or smaller inflows receive more evenly distributed or slightly relaxed allocations, preserving economic mobility. The cooperation across states reflects a portfolio approach to risk, distributing stricter controls early to flatten initial importation peaks, then progressively relaxing controls to restore economic activity. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter and more front-loaded control patterns would be warranted to maintain epidemic control. Conversely, if prevalence reduces, allocations could be more evenly distributed to promote mobility. This strategy balances epidemic control and mobility needs, aiming to reduce cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Arkansas while sustaining essential inflow. All fractions strictly sum to 1 for each state, ensuring total inbound flow consistency."

The imported infected cases can be approximated by Flow * ft * (I / population), where the population is roughly the sum of all SEIQRD compartments. Given the stable infection prevalence and steady flow, an even distribution of traffic control (even pattern) is used to balance mobility and epidemic control, minimizing sudden spikes in imported infections.

States with lower or moderate prevalence employ even or modest relaxed-first patterns to smooth risk and maintain economic activity. This cross-state strategy reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths by distributing risk over time, preventing early spikes that could overwhelm Arkansas's healthcare system. Quantitatively, imported infections approximate Flow*ft*(I/population), so adjusting ft weekly modulates seeding risk. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls (lower initial ft) become more critical to contain spread. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more balanced or relaxed policies suffice.

    "notes": "Alabama exhibits a large susceptible population (4,846,583) with very low exposed (1,285) and infected (406) counts relative to its size, indicating a generally low but non-negligible epidemic risk. The imported infected estimate scales with Flow*ft*(I/population), where I/population is approximately 406/4846583 ~ 8.38e-5. With a high average inflow (20,076 daily), the expected imported infections could be significant if traffic is not controlled. Given a relatively steady low prevalence, a strict-first pattern is chosen to reduce inbound flow in the earlier weeks (fractions 0.28, 0.27) to quickly suppress introduction risk, then gradually relax (0.23, 0.22) as the situation stabilizes and to balance economic needs. This trade-off aims to minimize imported infections early to protect Arkansas, while easing restrictions later to support mobility.

With moderate inbound flow (3,345 daily), imported infections can still be substantial. A strict-first pattern is adopted to reduce early-week inflow (fractions 0.30, 0.28) to contain potential importation, followed by relaxation (0.22, 0.20) as cases hopefully decline or immunity increases.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies for inbound flows to Arkansas from all origin states collectively aim to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically adjusting weekly fractions while preserving total 4-week flow. States with high infected prevalence and/or large inflow volumes (e.g., Oklahoma, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas) receive strict-first patterns with higher restrictions in early weeks to sharply reduce the importation risk when the epidemic pressure is greatest. This front-loading of control reduces seeding of new infections in Arkansas and limits secondary spread. Conversely, states with lower prevalence or smaller inflow volumes (e.g., Idaho, Minnesota, Wisconsin) are assigned even or relaxed-first patterns to balance epidemic control with economic and mobility needs, avoiding unnecessary disruption. This cross-state cooperation ensures that the aggregate imported infection pressure is minimized especially in early weeks when Arkansas is vulnerable, while allowing gradual relaxation to support mobility and economic recovery later. The quantitative cooperation logic hinges on the formula imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population), where ft fractions are tuned to reduce importation risk when I/population and Flow are high. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission parameters (e.g., beta) increase, stricter or more front-loaded controls would be needed to maintain low importation. Conversely, if prevalence declines, more relaxed patterns could be adopted earlier. The policy thus provides a flexible framework that is dynamically responsive to epidemic indicators and mobility demands, optimizing public health outcomes while preserving essential traffic flows. All weekly fractions sum exactly to 1 per origin state, preserving the ground truth total inbound flow and ensuring policy feasibility."

    "notes": "Alabama has a large susceptible population (4,834,585) and relatively low exposed (1,603) and infected (500) counts compared to its population, indicating moderate infection pressure. The imported infected cases can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / total population), which is low due to the small infected ratio (~0.0001). Given the fairly stable infection levels and moderate flow (9,515 daily), an even distribution of traffic control (fractions all 0.25) is chosen to balance epidemic control and mobility needs. This pattern avoids sudden surges or drops in traffic that could disrupt economic or social activity. The sum of fractions is exactly 1, ensuring the total inbound flow over 4 weeks remains consistent."

A relaxed-first pattern is chosen to gradually increase flow as control measures allow better management of cases: stricter control initially (0.15, 0.20) then relaxation (0.30, 0.35).

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce imported infections and deaths in Arkansas, the traffic control policy prioritizes stricter controls in early weeks for origin states with high infected or exposed counts and/or high inbound flows, such as Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Mississippi, and Idaho. This strict-first or front-loaded approach minimizes early seeding of infections when importation risks are greatest. For states with moderate to low infection pressure and flow, an even distribution of traffic is used to maintain stability and avoid economic disruption. Relaxed-first patterns are applied for states with rising or sustained infection prevalence but moderate flows, allowing gradual mobility restoration while managing risk. The total inbound flow from each origin state remains constant over 4 weeks, satisfying epidemiological and economic constraints. By balancing traffic flow temporally, the policy reduces cumulative infection pressure on Arkansas's population, lowering anticipated confirmed cases and deaths. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls would yield greater benefits, while lower prevalence may allow more balanced or relaxed patterns. Coordinated allocation across states ensures that peak importation periods do not coincide, smoothing epidemic pressure. This cooperative approach leverages SEIQRD compartment insights and mobility baselines to optimize disease control while preserving essential mobility and economic activity within Arkansas."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocation for Arkansas from all origin states is designed to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by balancing epidemic control and mobility needs across four weeks. States with higher infection pressures, indicated by higher infected (I) and exposed (E) proportions relative to their susceptible population, are assigned stricter traffic control later in the period (strict-first pattern) to reduce imported infections when prevalence may increase. Conversely, states with lower infection pressures or large susceptible populations with moderate infections often receive even or relaxed-first patterns to maintain economic and social mobility while controlling disease spread. The formula for expected imported infections, approximately Flow * ft * (I/population), underpins the allocation logic, ensuring that weekly fractions modulate the risk while keeping total inbound flow constant. Coordination across states and weeks allows balancing peaks of risk, preventing simultaneous high imports from multiple high-risk states. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter controls early in the period would be beneficial to suppress exponential growth, while if these parameters decrease, more relaxed patterns can be safely adopted. This policy framework maintains the total flow from each state constant (fractions sum to 1), but redistributes it weekly to optimize health outcomes and mobility.

States with higher infection pressures, indicated by higher infected (I) and exposed (E) proportions relative to their susceptible population, are assigned stricter traffic control later in the period (strict-first pattern) to reduce imported infections when prevalence may increase. Conversely, states with lower infection pressures or large susceptible populations with moderate infections often receive even or relaxed-first patterns to maintain economic and social mobility while controlling disease spread. The formula for expected imported infections, approximately Flow * ft * (I/population), underpins the allocation logic, ensuring that weekly fractions modulate the risk while keeping total inbound flow constant. Coordination across states and weeks allows balancing peaks of risk, preventing simultaneous high imports from multiple high-risk states. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter controls early in the period would be beneficial to suppress exponential growth, while if these parameters decrease, more relaxed patterns can be safely adopted. This policy framework maintains the total flow from each state constant (fractions sum to 1), but redistributes it weekly to optimize health outcomes and mobility. It also allows dynamic adjustments if surveillance data change, providing flexibility in response to evolving epidemic situations.'

The estimated imported infections can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)) with the population denominator roughly 4.8 million. Since Alabama's infection pressure is moderate and stable, a relaxed-first pattern is chosen to gradually increase inbound flow over the 4 weeks: starting stricter in week 1 (0.20) to limit initial risk, then increasing traffic in weeks 3 and 4.

  "global_guidance": "To minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Arkansas, inbound traffic allocations prioritize reducing early importation of infections from states with higher prevalence of infectious individuals (I) relative to their populations. Traffic control fractions (ft) modulate the daily inbound flow to Arkansas, keeping the total 4-week volume constant per state but shifting flow timing. States with higher infection pressure, such as Utah, Idaho, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee, receive stricter controls in early weeks (lower ft) to reduce immediate importation risk, following a strict-first traffic control pattern. States with moderate or lower prevalence follow either even or relaxed-first patterns to balance economic and social mobility needs with epidemic control. The imported infections are approximated as Flow * ft * (I/population), emphasizing the importance of reducing ft values when I/population is high. By collectively staggering and modulating flows across states and weeks, Arkansas reduces the influx of infectious individuals during peak transmission periods, thereby lowering secondary transmission and deaths locally. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if the prevalence of infection or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls are more critical to prevent exponential epidemic growth. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed policies could be safely adopted. The balancing act between epidemic control and mobility is carefully maintained by ensuring that the 4 fractions per state sum exactly to 1, preserving total inbound volume while optimizing temporal distribution to minimize public health impact."

    "notes": "Alabama shows relatively low infected (I=1053) and exposed (E=3404) numbers compared to its large susceptible population (S=4,763,319). Considering the average daily inflow of 7996.68, the imported infected can be approximated as imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population). Here, the infection pressure is moderate but not negligible. A strict-first pattern is recommended, imposing stricter controls in the first two weeks (f1=0.30, f2=0.30) to reduce immediate importation risk, then slightly relaxing later (f3=0.20, f4=0.20) as local containment takes effect. This balances epidemic control by front-loading restrictions while allowing some mobility to resume, supporting economic activity. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000."

Imported infections scale as Flow*ft*(I/population). Given the higher infection prevalence relative to Alabama, a stricter-first approach is favored to minimize early importation. We allocate higher control early (f1=0.35, f2=0.30) and progressively relax (f3=0.20, f4=0.15). This helps curb initial imported cases while gradually reopening mobility.

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, these inbound traffic allocations aim to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Arkansas by balancing imported infection risk and mobility needs across all origin states.

For states with moderate to low prevalence or inflow, even or hybrid patterns smooth restrictions over time to avoid sharp mobility shocks while maintaining epidemic control.
