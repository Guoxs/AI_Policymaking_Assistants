  "global_guidance": "Considering all origin states collectively, the traffic control policy strategically uses strict-first or even patterns based on infection prevalence and inflow magnitude to minimize imported infections and deaths in Iowa. States with high infection pressure (high I and E counts relative to susceptible) and substantial inflow are assigned stricter controls in initial weeks to reduce early imported cases, allowing Iowa's health system to manage local spread effectively. Lower risk states or those with large inflow but low prevalence employ even patterns, balancing epidemic control with economic and social mobility. The total inbound flow from each state is conserved over four weeks by redistributing fractions to favor safer timing, thus maintaining essential mobility without increasing cumulative importation risk. Quantitatively, expected imported infections approximate Flow * ft * (I / Population), so reducing ft in weeks where local Iowa prevalence is low or control capacity is limited mitigates risk. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection transmission rates (beta) or prevalence increase, stricter front-loaded controls would be even more beneficial; conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed or even distributions could be applied to improve mobility. The approach balances epidemic control, healthcare capacity, and economic considerations, ensuring fractions sum exactly to one for each origin state to maintain total flow.

States with high infection pressure (high I and E counts relative to susceptible) and substantial inflow are assigned stricter controls in initial weeks to reduce early imported cases, allowing Iowa's health system to manage local spread effectively. Lower risk states or those with large inflow but low prevalence employ even patterns, balancing epidemic control with economic and social mobility. The total inbound flow from each state is conserved over four weeks by redistributing fractions to favor safer timing, thus maintaining essential mobility without increasing cumulative importation risk. Quantitatively, expected imported infections approximate Flow * ft * (I / Population), so reducing ft in weeks where local Iowa prevalence is low or control capacity is limited mitigates risk. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection transmission rates (beta) or prevalence increase, stricter front-loaded controls would be even more beneficial; conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed or even distributions could be applied to improve mobility. The approach balances epidemic control, healthcare capacity, and economic considerations, ensuring fractions sum exactly to one for each origin state to maintain total flow. This coordinated policy optimally reduces cumulative cases and deaths in Iowa while sustaining necessary cross-state travel."

  "global_guidance": "The overall traffic control policy allocates inbound traffic from origin states into Iowa by balancing epidemic risk and mobility needs through the next four weeks. States with higher infection ratios (I/S) and exposed populations receive stricter control early (strict-first pattern) to curb early importations, which are critical in minimizing downstream confirmed cases and deaths inside Iowa. States with low infection ratios and large populations adopt even or relaxed-first patterns, supporting economic activity while maintaining manageable risks. This cross-state cooperation leverages temporal distribution of inbound flows such that high-risk importations are dampened initially, allowing Iowa's health system to better absorb and control local transmission. Quantitatively, imported infections scale with the product of inbound flow fraction and infection prevalence in origin populations. By front-loading restrictions on high prevalence states, the cumulative imported infections are minimized. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence increases or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early controls would be even more beneficial, whereas lower prevalence states can sustain more relaxed policies. The policy explicitly maintains the total inbound flow constant per origin state over the 28 days, ensuring economic connectivity is preserved while optimizing health outcomes. The carefully chosen weekly fractions sum exactly to 1 for each state, validating compliance with constraints. This dynamic, risk-informed, and temporally adaptive strategy best supports Iowa's epidemic control and mobility balance."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocations prioritize reducing early week imported infections into Iowa, which is crucial given Iowa's current susceptible and exposed population.

States with large populations but moderate infection prevalence and high flows (e.g., Minnesota, Nebraska, Michigan) use even or relaxed-first patterns to balance epidemic control and economic activity. The cumulative approach across states reduces the overall imported infection pressure by staggering inbound flows to avoid surges. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections from a given origin state are proportional to Flow * ft * (I/population). By adjusting ft weekly, we distribute risk temporally to prevent concentration of cases and allow Iowa's epidemic control measures to adapt. Sensitivity analysis shows if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls and more pronounced strict-first patterns would be necessary. Conversely, if prevalence declines or beta reduces, more even or relaxed-first patterns could safely increase mobility earlier. This framework ensures adaptive, data-driven mobility policy that minimizes cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Iowa while respecting socio-economic needs."

The daily inbound flow to Iowa is moderate (2631.7). The expected imported infections roughly scale with Flow*ft*(I/population), where population ~ sum of SEIQRD compartments. Since Alabama's infection pressure is stable and relatively low, an even distribution of inflow fractions [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25] is chosen to balance mobility and epidemic control. This pattern maintains constant flow while reducing mobility restrictions that would heavily impact economic activity. The sum of fractions is exactly 1, validating allocation."

  "global_guidance": "Given Iowa's epidemic parameters and current state, the recommended inbound traffic policies aim to minimize imported infections by adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions while keeping total 4-week flow constant per origin state. States with higher infected and exposed populations, or higher daily inflow to Iowa, receive stricter control in early weeks (lower fractions) to delay and spread out imported infection risk, allowing Iowa's healthcare system to better manage cases and reduce deaths. This relaxed-first pattern is applied to states with significant infection pressure and/or large inflow volumes (e.g., Arkansas, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Nebraska). For states with lower infection prevalence or low inflow, an even distribution of fractions is used to balance epidemic control and mobility needs, avoiding unnecessary economic disruption. The logic follows expected imported infections approximated by Flow*ft*(I/population), where fractions ft modulate imported infectious individuals over time. By smoothing peaks and reducing early importation, cumulative cases and deaths in Iowa are expected to decrease. The cooperation among origin states' allocations balances epidemic risk across weeks, preventing overwhelming surges. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases in any origin state, stricter early restrictions would be needed to reduce imported infections. Conversely, if prevalence declines, fractions can be relaxed earlier to restore mobility. The chosen fractions sum exactly to 1 per origin state, ensuring no net change in total inbound flow. This policy thus strategically delays and distributes imported infection risk, balancing public health goals and economic mobility."

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic control policies for Iowa balance epidemic control with mobility across diverse origin states. States with higher infection prevalence or higher infected-to-susceptible ratios (e.g., Arkansas, Ohio, Michigan) are recommended stricter control early (strict-first pattern) to reduce early imported infections, which have outsized impact on local epidemic growth. States with stable or moderate infection risk (e.g., Arizona, Minnesota, Texas) have more even traffic allocations to preserve mobility while managing risk. Total inbound flows are conserved over four weeks, but timing is adjusted to flatten importation risk peaks. This coordinated approach reduces cumulative imported infections, limiting secondary spread and deaths in Iowa. Quantitatively, importing infected individuals depends on inbound flow, fraction allocated per week, and infected prevalence (I/population). Shifting flow away from high prevalence weeks mitigates import risk. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) increases, earlier and stricter restrictions yield stronger benefits. Conversely, if prevalence falls, more relaxed policies may be feasible. The approach also considers trade-offs: overly strict controls delay economic and social mobility, while relaxed controls risk epidemic spikes. By tailoring weekly fractions per origin state based on infection risk and flow volumes, the policy optimizes epidemic control while maintaining essential travel. This coordinated, dynamic allocation strategy is critical for managing disease spread in interconnected regions."

  "global_guidance": "The overall traffic allocation strategy balances infection risk and economic mobility by adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions for each origin state while keeping total four-week flow constant. States with higher infected and exposed proportions relative to population (e.g., Arkansas, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Utah) receive stricter control in early weeks (strict-first pattern), minimizing early imported infections as estimated by Flow * ft * (I/population). This front-loading of restrictions reduces immediate transmission pressure on Iowa. States with lower or moderate prevalence and exposure (e.g., Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska, South Carolina, Virginia, Texas) maintain even allocation, balancing epidemic control and economic continuity. The cooperation logic involves redistributing traffic to later weeks where infection pressure is lower, effectively flattening importation risk peaks. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if local prevalence in origin states shifts, stricter early control may be needed to prevent seeding. Similarly, higher beta (transmission rate) increases the cost of imported infections, reinforcing the need for front-loaded controls. This coordinated, data-driven approach reduces expected imported infections and deaths by controlling timing and magnitude of inbound flow, thus aiding Iowa's epidemic management while supporting mobility and economic activities."

The imported infections roughly scale with Flow * ft * (I / population). Alabama's flow into Iowa is modest (daily avg ~1863). Given the steady infection level and flow, a near-even distribution of inbound traffic (fractions close to 0.25 each) is chosen to balance epidemic control and mobility. This even pattern avoids sudden surges or overly strict restrictions that could cause economic disruptions. The four fractions sum exactly to 1, validating the allocation."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic control policies for Iowa strategically allocate traffic fractions over the next four weeks for each origin state to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. States with higher infection prevalence (high I and E relative to S) and significant inbound flow are assigned stricter controls in the earlier weeks (lower fractions in weeks 1 and 2) to reduce early importation of infections, which is critical since early imported cases can cause exponential spread in Iowa. This strict-first pattern is applied to states such as Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Texas, Tennessee, Wisconsin, and Nebraska with high infection pressures and/or large flows. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence and/or smaller flows are assigned near-even allocations to maintain mobility and avoid severe economic disruption. This balanced approach exploits the temporal dimension by concentrating restrictions when imported risk is highest and relaxing controls later to support economic activity. Quantitatively, imported infected individuals are approximately proportional to the product of the flow, fraction allocated, and infection prevalence (I/population). By reducing fractions in weeks when prevalence or flow is high, the policy minimizes imported infections. The total inbound flow from each origin state remains constant over four weeks, ensuring no displacement of travel but temporal smoothing of risk. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence increases or transmission rate beta rises, stricter early controls become even more critical to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence drops or vaccination improves, controls can be relaxed earlier. The coordinated cross-state approach balances risks dynamically, allocating stricter controls in high-risk states and times while preserving overall mobility to limit economic harm.

States with higher infection prevalence (high I and E relative to S) and significant inbound flow are assigned stricter controls in the earlier weeks (lower fractions in weeks 1 and 2) to reduce early importation of infections, which is critical since early imported cases can cause exponential spread in Iowa. This strict-first pattern is applied to states such as Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Texas, Tennessee, Wisconsin, and Nebraska with high infection pressures and/or large flows. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence and/or smaller flows are assigned near-even allocations to maintain mobility and avoid severe economic disruption. This balanced approach exploits the temporal dimension by concentrating restrictions when imported risk is highest and relaxing controls later to support economic activity. Quantitatively, imported infected individuals are approximately proportional to the product of the flow, fraction allocated, and infection prevalence (I/population). By reducing fractions in weeks when prevalence or flow is high, the policy minimizes imported infections. The total inbound flow from each origin state remains constant over four weeks, ensuring no displacement of travel but temporal smoothing of risk. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence increases or transmission rate beta rises, stricter early controls become even more critical to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence drops or vaccination improves, controls can be relaxed earlier. The coordinated cross-state approach balances risks dynamically, allocating stricter controls in high-risk states and times while preserving overall mobility to limit economic harm. This cooperative method reduces cumulative epidemic burden in Iowa more effectively than uniform or uncoordinated policies.'

The ratio I/population is small, indicating moderate risk. Incoming flow is moderate (2184 daily avg). Imported infected can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/total_pop), so controlling inflow early helps reduce seeding in Iowa. The pattern chosen is strict-first, applying stricter control (lower fractions) in the initial weeks to suppress early importation, then gradually relaxing.

This approach minimizes the cumulative imported infections into Iowa during the critical early weeks when local susceptible and exposed populations are vulnerable to seeding. By controlling early inflow from high-risk states, the overall force of infection in Iowa can be reduced, leading to fewer confirmed cases and deaths. Simultaneously, gradual relaxation of restrictions balances the economic and mobility needs, avoiding prolonged severe disruptions. The quantitative logic is based on the expected imported infected proportional to each state's daily inflow, infection prevalence (I/population), and weekly fraction ft, thus imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population). Balancing these factors week by week ensures risk is spread out, preventing sudden spikes in importation. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become even more critical, whereas lower beta or prevalence could allow more relaxed early mobility. Cross-state cooperation is implicitly embedded by allocating control intensity relative to each origin state's local epidemic pressure and mobility baseline, balancing risks and benefits holistically.
