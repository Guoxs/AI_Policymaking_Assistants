Expected imported infections are proportional to Flow * ft * (I / population). Given the relatively stable infection levels and moderate inbound flow (9943.57 per day), evenly distributing traffic over the four weeks balances epidemic control and mobility needs.

States with lower infection risk or very high mobility needs adopt even or relaxed-first patterns to balance epidemic control with economic activity. The quantitative cooperation logic ensures total inbound flows remain constant per origin over four weeks, but their temporal distribution minimizes peak imported infections. This inter-temporal balancing reduces cumulative incidence and death rates by preventing importation surges coinciding with local Virginia outbreaks. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence (I or E) increases in origin states, stricter early control (lower early fractions) would be necessary to prevent importation. Similarly, higher transmission rates (beta) in Virginia would call for more conservative mobility policies. Conversely, if prevalence or beta decreases, more relaxed patterns can be adopted to support economic recovery. Our approach reflects epidemic dynamics, mobility needs, and epidemic control trade-offs, ensuring all fraction sets sum to exactly 1 as required, maintaining the ground truth total traffic volumes while optimizing temporal flow distributions to minimize epidemic impact in Virginia."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies for Virginia strategically allocate inbound traffic fractions over four weeks from each origin state to minimize imported infections and cumulative cases. States with higher infection prevalence (high I and E relative to population) are assigned stricter controls in early weeks (low fractions) and relaxed controls later (higher fractions), following a relaxed-first pattern. This pattern reduces early high-risk importation while balancing economic and social mobility needs. The total inbound flows per origin remain constant over four weeks to preserve baseline mobility volumes. By staggering inbound traffic, we flatten the risk curve, preventing overwhelming importation spikes. Cross-state reasoning involves balancing risks: states with higher prevalence and large flows receive stricter early restrictions, whereas lower-risk states have more even allocations. This coordinated approach reduces overall imported infections and deaths in Virginia. Quantitatively, expected imported infections approximate Flow*ft*(I/population) per week, so reducing ft in early weeks from high-risk states lowers importation risk significantly. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become more critical. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta lowers, controls can be relaxed earlier. Overall, the policy optimizes epidemic suppression while maintaining mobility, validated by the exact sum of fractions to one per state, ensuring consistent flow allocation."

Given stable infection prevalence and no sharp trends, an even distribution pattern is chosen to keep traffic balanced over 4 weeks, minimizing sudden importation spikes. This approach balances epidemic control and mobility by not overly restricting any week, keeping economic and social functions steady. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.25*4)."

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy for Virginia's inbound traffic control balances epidemic control and mobility by adjusting weekly fractions per origin state's infection risk and population susceptibility. States with higher infected and exposed counts relative to their susceptible population, such as Michigan, Ohio, Texas, Idaho, and Arizona, generally receive stricter control in early weeks (strict-first pattern) to minimize initial importation of infected individuals, thereby reducing the risk of secondary outbreaks in Virginia. Conversely, states with lower or stable infection prevalence adopt more even or relaxed-first patterns, allowing economic and social activity to continue with minimal disruptions. This staggered approach across states and weeks reduces cumulative imported infections by preventing simultaneous peaks, allowing Virginia's health system time to respond and limiting exponential transmission. The quantitative logic relies on approximating imported infected individuals as proportional to the product of flow, fraction, and infection prevalence (I/population) in the origin state. By allocating fractions that sum exactly to 1, the total inbound flow remains constant, preserving overall mobility while redistributing it temporally to mitigate risk. Sensitivity analysis suggests if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls become more crucial to prevent overwhelming spread. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta reduces, the policy can relax earlier to restore mobility. This coordination across multiple origin states and weeks exemplifies a dynamic, data-driven approach to epidemic control that minimizes confirmed cases and deaths in Virginia while considering economic and social impacts."

    "notes": "Alabama shows a moderate infected (I=406) to population ratio relative to its large population (approx. 4.85 million susceptible and 406 infected). Considering the inbound flow of 13,354 daily, the expected imported infected individuals each week can be approximated by Flow*ft*(I/population). To minimize imported cases, a strict-first pattern is recommended with stricter control in the early weeks (lower fractions initially) when Virginia's own infection levels are moderate but increasing. This reduces early importation risk, allowing for better epidemic control. The trade-off is a temporary reduction in mobility early on, followed by relaxation to balance economic and social needs. The fractions sum to exactly 1, validating proper allocation."

    "notes": "Arizona has moderate exposure (E=3707) and infected (I=1100) cases in a population of over 7 million susceptible individuals. Given the inbound flow of 6,575, imported infections roughly correlate with Flow*ft*(I/population). The infection pressure is somewhat stable; thus, a slight strict-first pattern is applied to reduce importation risk early on. This balances mobility demands while reducing epidemic risks in Virginia by lowering inbound traffic when risk is potentially higher. The fractions add up to exactly 1, ensuring a valid distribution."

A strict-first pattern is appropriate, emphasizing reduced early flow (lower fractions initially) to counteract high importation risk. Later weeks have relaxed control to manage mobility needs. This trade-off prioritizes epidemic control early, when imported infections can greatly impact Virginia's epidemic trajectory. Fractions sum perfectly to 1, confirming consistency."

Given the low absolute inflow, an even pattern is justified as strict controls may not significantly reduce importation risk relative to the mobility cost. The formula Flow*ft*(I/population) yields small expected imports. Equal fractions maintain steady mobility while preventing spikes in importation. The sum of fractions equals 1, validating the approach."

  "global_guidance": "The traffic control policy across all origin states adopts mostly a strict-first pattern, emphasizing reduced inbound traffic in the initial weeks and gradually relaxing controls in later weeks. This collective strategy addresses Virginia's epidemic dynamics, where imported infections can seed new cases and exacerbate local outbreaks. Since expected imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/population) from each origin state, reducing early fractions for states with higher infected counts or large inflows minimizes cumulative importation risk during critical early epidemic phases. This coordinated temporal balancing allows Virginia to strengthen local control measures and healthcare readiness before easing restrictions. States with lower infected prevalence or smaller inflows adopt more even distributions to maintain steady mobility without significant epidemic risk. Quantitatively, this cooperation balances epidemic risks across states and weeks, ensuring no week is overwhelmed by imported infections while allowing mobility restoration over time. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if viral transmissibility (beta) or prevalence increases, stricter early controls become more beneficial due to nonlinear epidemic growth. Conversely, if prevalence drops or beta decreases, more relaxed or even distributions could suffice. This dynamic framework enables adaptive policy tuning based on real-time epidemic data. Overall, the recommended inbound traffic allocations collectively minimize Virginia's cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically timing travel restrictions, balancing public health protection with socioeconomic considerations."

The expected imported infections can be approximated as imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population), where population is roughly the sum of compartments. Given a steady inflow of 8805.86 daily, distributing traffic with a slight relaxation mid-period (weeks 3 and 4) allows for early control measures to reduce initial importation risk, then a mild relaxation as local Virginia conditions improve. The pattern chosen is relaxed-first, because Alabama's infection pressure is relatively stable but not extremely high, so early stricter control benefits overall epidemic control. The fractions sum to exactly 1 (0.20+0.25+0.30+0.25=1). This pattern balances control and mobility, allowing some economic activity while reducing epidemic risk."

Using imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I/population), and given a daily inflow of 5584.29, a stricter control in the last week (f4=0.20) is designed to mitigate potential increases in infections that may arise from delayed detection or reporting. The pattern is strict-last because infection pressure is significant and may rise, so delaying relaxation reduces peak importation risk. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.25+0.30+0.25+0.20=1).

The estimated imported infected cases depend on Flow * ft * (I/population). Given moderate inflow (2099), a moderate relaxation early (f1=0.30) with stricter control in later weeks (f4=0.20) balances mobility and epidemic risk, assuming potential outbreaks might escalate.

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic control policies across all origin states to Virginia are designed to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically adjusting weekly traffic fractions to reduce imported infections. The key logic is that imported infected individuals scale approximately with Flow * ft * (I / population), so controlling traffic more strictly during weeks of higher relative infection pressure or increasing prevalence can reduce the seeding of new infections in Virginia. States with higher infected and exposed proportions tend to have stricter control earlier (strict-first pattern) to prevent early seeding, while states with moderate or stable infection levels often have even or relaxed-first patterns to balance epidemic control and mobility. This cooperative approach balances epidemic risk across states and weeks, ensuring that total inbound flow remains constant but temporally redistributed to mitigate peaks in importation risk. The fractions always sum exactly to 1 to maintain total flow. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls would be needed to prevent exponential growth. Conversely, declines in infection would allow more relaxed policies. This multi-state temporal allocation strategy thus reduces expected imported infections and deaths by dampening importation during critical periods while preserving essential mobility and economic activity."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia, the inbound traffic control policy balances epidemic control and mobility by adjusting weekly traffic fractions for each origin state while keeping total 4-week inflow constant. States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to susceptible are assigned stricter traffic controls in the initial weeks (strict-first pattern) to minimize early importation of infected individuals, thereby reducing seeding and exponential growth within Virginia. States with stable or lower infection pressure maintain even traffic distributions to avoid unnecessary mobility restrictions. A few states with very high infection levels and dynamic trends adopt relaxed-first or staggered control patterns to manage risk while accommodating mobility needs. The imported infection risk is approximated by imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/S) for each state and week, guiding fraction adjustments. Collectively, front-loading restrictions in high-risk states reduces early epidemic pressure in Virginia, while gradual relaxation supports economic and social activity. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter front-loading would be necessary, whereas reductions in beta or infected numbers could allow more mobility. Cross-state coordination ensures that traffic control efforts are balanced to prevent overburdening any single states origin flow and to maximize health benefits while preserving reasonable travel.

States with higher infected and exposed populations relative to susceptible are assigned stricter traffic controls in the initial weeks (strict-first pattern) to minimize early importation of infected individuals, thereby reducing seeding and exponential growth within Virginia. States with stable or lower infection pressure maintain even traffic distributions to avoid unnecessary mobility restrictions. A few states with very high infection levels and dynamic trends adopt relaxed-first or staggered control patterns to manage risk while accommodating mobility needs. The imported infection risk is approximated by imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/S) for each state and week, guiding fraction adjustments. Collectively, front-loading restrictions in high-risk states reduces early epidemic pressure in Virginia, while gradual relaxation supports economic and social activity. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter front-loading would be necessary, whereas reductions in beta or infected numbers could allow more mobility. Cross-state coordination ensures that traffic control efforts are balanced to prevent overburdening any single states origin flow and to maximize health benefits while preserving reasonable travel. The approach thus optimizes temporal and spatial allocation of travel restrictions to minimize importation risk and epidemic impact in Virginia.'

  "global_guidance": "Collectively adjusting the inbound traffic fractions across all origin states creates a coordinated approach to minimize imported infections into Virginia over the next 4 weeks. States with higher infected and exposed proportions, especially those with large incoming flows, are subject to stricter initial controls (lower f1 fractions) to sharply reduce early imported infections, which are critical to prevent seeding outbreaks in Virginia. States with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflow have more balanced or even traffic distributions to maintain essential mobility and economic activity. This cooperation across states balances epidemic control with mobility needs, preventing overwhelming healthcare systems while minimizing economic disruption. Quantitatively, the expected imported infected travelers from each state in week t is approximately Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing ft in early weeks for high-risk states lowers this value. The phased relaxation allows gradual restoration of mobility as the epidemic risk diminishes or as local controls in Virginia improve. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter initial controls would be warranted, especially for high-inflow states. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, controls can be relaxed earlier. This strategy maintains flexibility and responsiveness, reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia while preserving essential travel and economic functions."

  "global_guidance": "The allocation strategy across all origin states aims to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Virginia by balancing epidemic risk and mobility needs. States with higher infection prevalence relative to population, such as Idaho, Wisconsin, Arkansas, Michigan, and Utah, receive stricter early-week controls (lower fractions in weeks 1 and 2) to limit early importation of infected individuals. This reduces immediate infection pressure on Virginia's healthcare system. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence, such as Kentucky and Nebraska, have more relaxed early controls, supporting economic activity while maintaining safety. The total inbound flow over four weeks per state remains constant, preserving overall mobility but redistributing weekly proportions to align with infection dynamics. Quantitatively, imported infections are proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing ft in weeks with higher infection pressure reduces infections imported. The patterns chosen (strict-first, relaxed-first, or even) depend on the infection trend and prevalence in origin states, ensuring adaptive control calibrated to risk. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence unexpectedly increases in a state, shifting to stricter controls earlier would be necessary to maintain control. Similarly, if the transmission rate beta increases, stricter controls or more aggressive front-loading of restrictions would be warranted. This cooperative and balanced approach across states and weeks optimizes epidemic control while avoiding severe disruptions to interstate mobility and economic activity."
