  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in New Mexico, the inbound traffic allocation policies prioritize early strict control on states with higher infected or exposed prevalence, especially those with large daily flows, such as Texas, Idaho, Utah, Oklahoma, and South Carolina. These states adopt a relaxed-first pattern with lower fractions in week 1 to reduce immediate imported infections, which roughly scale as Flow*ft*(I/S), thereby lowering infection pressure during the critical initial weeks. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller flow, such as Iowa, Nebraska, Alabama, and Minnesota, follow an even pattern to balance steady mobility and risk control, avoiding abrupt changes that may cause spikes in imported cases. States with moderate infection prevalence and flow mostly adopt relaxed-first patterns, gradually increasing flow allocation to reconcile epidemic control and economic mobility. This coordinated approach leverages quantitative cooperation logic by distributing risk temporally and spatially: early weeks see strict controls on high-risk origins to dampen initial importation, while later weeks ease restrictions to allow mobility recovery and economic activity. The total inbound flow per origin remains constant over the 4 weeks, preserving baseline mobility but shifting timing to reduce peak infection importation. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence (I/S) or transmission rate beta increases in any state, stricter early controls or longer suppression durations would be warranted to maintain control. Conversely, reductions in prevalence or beta could allow more relaxed early allocations. The approach also accounts for the mobility trade-off: overly strict sustained controls harm economic activity, while too relaxed policies risk overwhelming local healthcare.

These states adopt a relaxed-first pattern with lower fractions in week 1 to reduce immediate imported infections, which roughly scale as Flow*ft*(I/S), thereby lowering infection pressure during the critical initial weeks. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller flow, such as Iowa, Nebraska, Alabama, and Minnesota, follow an even pattern to balance steady mobility and risk control, avoiding abrupt changes that may cause spikes in imported cases. States with moderate infection prevalence and flow mostly adopt relaxed-first patterns, gradually increasing flow allocation to reconcile epidemic control and economic mobility. This coordinated approach leverages quantitative cooperation logic by distributing risk temporally and spatially: early weeks see strict controls on high-risk origins to dampen initial importation, while later weeks ease restrictions to allow mobility recovery and economic activity. The total inbound flow per origin remains constant over the 4 weeks, preserving baseline mobility but shifting timing to reduce peak infection importation. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence (I/S) or transmission rate beta increases in any state, stricter early controls or longer suppression durations would be warranted to maintain control. Conversely, reductions in prevalence or beta could allow more relaxed early allocations. The approach also accounts for the mobility trade-off: overly strict sustained controls harm economic activity, while too relaxed policies risk overwhelming local healthcare. The chosen patterns reflect a balanced, data-driven policy to minimize New Mexico's epidemic burden while sustaining essential mobility."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocation across origin states aims to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in New Mexico by adjusting weekly traffic proportions while keeping total 4-week inbound flow constant per origin. States with higher infected and exposed proportions relative to susceptible populations receive stricter early-week traffic controls (strict-first pattern) to reduce initial importation pressure when the risk of seeding new infections is highest. This frontloaded control helps suppress epidemic growth early, leveraging the nonlinear dynamics of disease spread. Conversely, states with lower or stable infection prevalence adopt even or relaxed-first patterns, balancing epidemic control with economic mobility by allowing more traffic initially but tightening later or maintaining steady flow. The imported infection risk is approximated as proportional to the product of inbound flow, weekly fraction, and prevalence (I/S), guiding fractional allocations to reduce early high-risk inflows. By distributing restrictions over weeks and states, the policy avoids overwhelming any single week with severe controls, thus smoothing mobility impacts and preserving economic activity. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence rises or the transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls become more critical to prevent exponential growth. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed allocations could be justified. This cross-state cooperative allocation optimizes the trade-off between epidemic suppression and mobility, reducing imported infections and deaths effectively while maintaining essential traffic flow into New Mexico."

    "notes": "Alabama presents a moderately low infectious prevalence (I=426) relative to its susceptible population (S=4,856,818). The expected imported infections can be approximated by Flow * ft * (I / population), indicating that with a low infected proportion, the risk per traveler is moderate. The traffic allocation pattern chosen is even, distributing inbound flow equally across the 4 weeks (each fraction 0.25), to maintain steady mobility while minimizing infection spikes. The trade-off balances economic activity and epidemic control, as strict early restrictions might overly suppress mobility without proportionate infection risk reduction given Alabama's moderate infection levels. The fractions sum exactly to 1 ensuring policy validity."

Given the higher infection pressure, imported infections are calculated as Flow * ft * (I/population), suggesting increased risk. The pattern chosen is relaxed-first, gradually increasing flow allocation over 4 weeks, starting stricter (0.15) and then relaxing, aiming to reduce immediate imported risk while allowing mobility later as local controls improve. This trade-off reduces initial imported infections and potential secondary outbreaks. The fractions sum to 1 exactly, validating the distribution."

  "global_guidance": "In developing these inbound traffic control policies for New Mexico, a cross-state cooperative approach is essential to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. States with higher infection and exposed counts relative to their population, such as Michigan, Ohio, Arizona, and Texas, have been assigned stricter inbound control in the initial weeks, progressively relaxing restrictions as local epidemic conditions stabilize. This relaxed-first pattern in high-risk states reduces early imported infections, lowering the risk of seeding new outbreaks in New Mexico.\n\nConversely, states with lower infection prevalence or moderate risk are allocated either even or strict-first patterns to balance mobility and epidemic control. Even distributions help maintain steady flow and avoid surges in imported infections, while strict-first patterns taper flows later to pre-empt potential infection escalations. This temporal allocation of flow fractions balances the trade-off between epidemic control and socio-economic mobility.\n\nQuantitatively, the expected number of imported infections from each origin state is approximated by Flow * ft * (I/population). By lowering ft in weeks of higher infection prevalence or risk, the cumulative imported infections are minimized. The sum of fractions for each state is maintained exactly at 1 to preserve total inbound flow, ensuring no reduction in total mobility volume but optimizing its temporal distribution.\n\nSensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increase, stricter early controls (lower ft in initial weeks) become more effective at preventing outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, relaxations can be advanced. This adaptive and balanced approach across origin states and weeks is designed to collectively minimize new infections and deaths in New Mexico while sustaining vital mobility and economic functions."

The imported infected cases roughly scale as Flow * ft * (I / population), here I/pop ~ 8.38e-5. Given the moderate infection pressure but significant flow (2010 daily average), a strict-first pattern is optimal to reduce initial imported infections and allow for possible decay in prevalence over time.

  "global_guidance": "To collectively minimize the expected imported infections and associated deaths in New Mexico, the traffic allocation leverages risk-based adjustments per origin state, balancing epidemic control and mobility needs. States with higher infection prevalence (e.g., Utah, Arizona, Michigan) and/or large flows (Texas) receive strict-first patterns to front-load restrictions, reducing early importation risks when New Mexico's control measures are most critical. Lower-risk states or those with moderate infection prevalence adopt even allocation patterns to maintain mobility while controlling risk. The total inbound flow from each state remains constant, ensuring economic activity continuity. The weekly fractions per state sum exactly to 1, preserving total flow while redistributing it over time. Quantitatively, the imported infected cases approximate Flow * ft * (I/population), so shifting traffic to later weeks lowers early infection seeding, allowing New Mexico time to detect and isolate cases. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early restrictions become more effective. Conversely, if prevalence declines, allocations can relax accordingly without compromising control. This coordinated, data-driven approach balances public health priorities with socioeconomic considerations, optimizing traffic control to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in New Mexico."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic control policies collectively aim to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in New Mexico by reducing the importation of infections from other states. All origin states maintain the total inbound flow constant over the 4 weeks, respecting mobility demands. The key risk measure is the ratio of infected individuals to total population in the origin state, modulated by the inbound flow. States with higher infectious prevalence and/or higher inbound flow are assigned stricter traffic controls in the initial weeks (strict-first pattern), reducing the early seeding of infection into New Mexico when local epidemic dynamics are more sensitive. Conversely, states with lower infectious prevalence or lower inflow adopt either even or mild strict-first patterns to maintain economic activity with balanced risk. The strict-first pattern frontloads control efforts: low fractions in early weeks reduce early imported infections, which is critical given the exponential nature of disease spread and New Mexico's current susceptible and infected populations. Gradual relaxation allows adaptive response as local immunity builds or interventions improve. Even patterns are applied to states with moderate infection prevalence and lower inflow to maintain steady importation and mobility, preventing abrupt mobility restrictions that could disrupt economic activities. The policy balances epidemic risk and social-economic considerations by spreading control efforts temporally and geographically. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter and more front-loaded controls would be advisable to prevent importation-driven outbreaks. If prevalence falls or vaccination coverage rises, more relaxed or even distributions can be adapted. Cooperation across states by adjusting weekly proportions rather than total flow preserves essential mobility while targeting high-risk periods for intervention. This coordinated approach enhances epidemic control efficiency and economic sustainability under uncertainty."

The imported infected cases can be roughly estimated as Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)), indicating that infection pressure scales with the fraction of infected individuals in Alabama. Given the steady infection level, a strict-first pattern is chosen to front-load stricter control in the first two weeks, thus reducing initial imported cases and allowing time for local epidemic control in New Mexico. This approach balances epidemic control and mobility by gradually relaxing restrictions, avoiding abrupt mobility shocks.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocation collectively prioritizes reducing initial imported infections from states with higher infection prevalence and larger inflows, especially Arizona, Texas, Michigan, Alabama, and Oklahoma. By applying stricter controls in the first two weeks (strict-first pattern) for these states, the policy aims to minimize infection seeding in New Mexico when the susceptible population is large, thereby lowering cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. For states with lower infection prevalence or inflow, an even or relaxed-first pattern balances epidemic control with mobility needs, preventing excessive economic disruption and social hardship. Quantitatively, the expected imported infected cases from each state are proportional to the product of the traffic fraction and the infected proportion in the origin population (Flow*ft*(I/population)). Allocating lower fractions in early weeks for high-risk states reduces the seeding effect during critical periods. This cross-state cooperation ensures that total imported infections into New Mexico are minimized over the 4-week horizon, reducing epidemic growth pressure. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter front-loading of controls becomes more beneficial, whereas lower prevalence or beta allows more relaxed patterns. The allocations enforce the sum of fractions to exactly 1 per state, maintaining total inbound flow constant while redistributing weekly flow to optimize epidemic outcomes. This balanced approach supports New Mexico's epidemic control goals alongside essential mobility and economic considerations."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic control policies for New Mexico strategically allocate traffic fractions over the next four weeks based on epidemic risk indicators (I and E) relative to state populations. States with higher infection pressure (notably Idaho, Indiana, Michigan, Utah, Wisconsin) have stricter controls in early weeks to reduce imported infections, reflecting a strict-first or relaxed-first pattern depending on infection trajectory and population size. States with moderate or low infection pressure adopt even or slight strict-first patterns to maintain a balance between epidemic control and necessary mobility. The total inbound flow from each origin state remains constant over the 4 weeks, preserving overall transportation demand but redistributing it to minimize peak infection importation risk. This coordinated approach leverages temporal risk balancing: reducing flow when prevalence is highest and gradually relaxing it as risk declines or mobility demands increase. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections approximate Flow * fraction * (I/population), so lowering fractions in weeks with higher risk effectively suppresses epidemic importation. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence increases or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early-week controls yield greater benefits, whereas lower prevalence permits more even or relaxed patterns, improving mobility with manageable risk.

States with higher infection pressure (notably Idaho, Indiana, Michigan, Utah, Wisconsin) have stricter controls in early weeks to reduce imported infections, reflecting a strict-first or relaxed-first pattern depending on infection trajectory and population size. States with moderate or low infection pressure adopt even or slight strict-first patterns to maintain a balance between epidemic control and necessary mobility. The total inbound flow from each origin state remains constant over the 4 weeks, preserving overall transportation demand but redistributing it to minimize peak infection importation risk. This coordinated approach leverages temporal risk balancing: reducing flow when prevalence is highest and gradually relaxing it as risk declines or mobility demands increase. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections approximate Flow * fraction * (I/population), so lowering fractions in weeks with higher risk effectively suppresses epidemic importation. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence increases or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early-week controls yield greater benefits, whereas lower prevalence permits more even or relaxed patterns, improving mobility with manageable risk. This policy ensemble optimizes the trade-off between epidemic mitigation in New Mexico and preserving interstate travel, thereby minimizing cumulative confirmed cases and deaths effectively over the upcoming month.'
