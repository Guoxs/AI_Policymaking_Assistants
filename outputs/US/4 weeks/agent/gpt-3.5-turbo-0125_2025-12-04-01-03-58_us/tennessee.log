    "notes": "Alabama presents a relatively low infected population (I=385) compared to a large susceptible population (S=4,883,910). The imported infected cases can be approximately estimated as Flow*ft*(I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)) which is around Flow*ft*385/4,900,787. Since the prevalence is low, traffic control can be balanced. We choose an even distribution pattern [0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25] to maintain consistent mobility while managing risk. This evenly spreads the inbound flow to reduce sudden spikes in imported infections. The trade-off balances economic activity and epidemic control, ensuring no week is overly relaxed or strict. The fractions sum to exactly 1."

The infected population is small but non-negligible. A relaxed-first pattern [0.20,0.20,0.30,0.30] is chosen to impose stricter control in the early weeks when Tennessee's own infection is moderate, and relax controls later as local immunity possibly increases. This delays some inbound flow to later weeks, reducing initial importation pressure. This pattern balances epidemic mitigation and mobility needs. Fractions sum to 1."

Because Arkansas has a higher infection prevalence, a strict-first pattern [0.30,0.30,0.20,0.20] is selected to front-load stricter control (lower fractions) in weeks 3-4, but still allow moderate flow initially to balance economic impact. This reduces peak importation risk in later weeks when Tennessee may be more vulnerable, while keeping total flow constant. Trade-offs involve higher initial risk but better control over time.

Using a strict-first pattern [0.35,0.30,0.20,0.15] allocating more control in later weeks reduces importation risk as Tennessee manages its epidemic.

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocations across all origin states aim to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Tennessee by strategically distributing the total inbound flow over the next four weeks. States with relatively higher infected and exposed populations, such as Idaho, Arkansas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Utah, and South Carolina, receive stricter control early or in a strict-first pattern to reduce the importation of infected individuals during critical periods when Tennessee's local epidemic may be vulnerable. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence like Alabama, Indiana, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Minnesota are assigned even or relaxed-first patterns to maintain economic activity without significantly increasing importation risk. The quantitative logic centers on the importation risk being proportional to the product of inbound flow, fraction allocation, and the infected proportion of the origin state population (imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/Population)). By adjusting the weekly fractions to lower values during weeks of higher risk, the policy delays or reduces inbound infected travelers, thereby flattening the imported infection curve in Tennessee. This temporal balancing acts as a coordination mechanism between states, where low fractions in early weeks for high-risk states reduce initial infection pressure, allowing Tennessee to better manage local transmission and reduce cumulative cases and deaths. The sensitivity of the results suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase in any origin state, stricter early controls should be considered, whereas decreases in prevalence could allow more relaxed controls. Similarly, changes in Tennessee’s local epidemic parameters affect the optimal timing of relaxed controls. Overall, the policy balances epidemic control and mobility by preserving total inbound volume but varying temporal distribution, limiting peak importation risk while supporting economic connectivity."

The confirmed cases are relatively high at 11,916, indicating ongoing detection and isolation efforts. The total population implies a low infection prevalence (I/population). Expected imported infections are proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population). Given the consistent moderate infection pressure, a strict-first pattern is advised to reduce early week inflow, thereby lowering initial imported infections. This reduces the epidemic seed in Tennessee while gradually relaxing controls towards week 4 to balance mobility needs. Trade-offs include initial mobility restrictions that may affect economic and social activities, but control is prioritized to limit spread.

Given the moderate infection pressure and smaller flow, an even allocation pattern is chosen to maintain consistent mobility while not causing spikes in imported infections.

A strict-first pattern is chosen to front-load stricter controls in weeks 1 and 2, which helps reduce early imported infections since imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population).

    "notes": "Wisconsin has a susceptible population of ~5.8 million, moderate infected (3,125), and confirmed cases (7,438). The inbound flow is low (7,583 daily). Given moderate infection prevalence and low flow, an even allocation is chosen to balance epidemic control and mobility. Expected imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/population).

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocation collectively employs strict-first patterns for origin states with high inbound flow and moderate to high infection prevalence, such as Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. This front-loads stricter travel controls in the initial weeks, reducing imported infections early and slowing epidemic seeding in Tennessee. States with lower flow or lower infection prevalence, such as Arizona, Iowa, Minnesota, New Mexico, and Wisconsin, receive even allocation patterns to maintain mobility while keeping imported infection risk manageable. States with relatively high infection prevalence but low flow, such as Idaho and Utah, have relaxed-first patterns to delay travel peaks, allowing Tennessee to prepare for potential cases. This mixed strategy balances epidemic containment with economic and social mobility needs. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections from each origin state scale as Flow*ft*(I/population), so adjusting weekly fractions ft shifts infection pressure over time without changing total imports. By lowering ft in early weeks for high-risk states, early seeding is minimized, which is critical for controlling outbreak propagation dynamics given Tennessee's SEIQRD parameters. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, strict-first patterns can be intensified by reducing early week fractions further, while if prevalence declines, more even or relaxed-first patterns may be considered to support mobility. Cross-state cooperation is implicit as overall inbound flow remains constant per state, but timing is adjusted to flatten infection import peaks and allow Tennessee's public health system to effectively respond. This approach optimizes disease control while preserving necessary travel and economic functions."

The risk of imported infections can be approximated by Flow * ft * (I / population). Since the infected proportion is low and stable, an even distribution of traffic control (even pattern) is chosen to maintain consistent mobility while controlling risk. The total flow is large (104492 daily average), so spreading traffic evenly avoids sudden spikes in imported cases. Trade-offs balance maintaining economic and social activity with epidemic control.

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the recommended inbound traffic allocations across all origin states to Tennessee aim to minimize imported infections and subsequent confirmed and deceased cases by adjusting weekly traffic proportions while keeping total 4-week flow constant. States with higher infection prevalence and exposed populations receive stricter controls in early weeks (strict-first pattern) to prevent initial seeding of infections. Conversely, states with expected declining prevalence or lower initial infection levels are given relaxed-first or even patterns, easing mobility in mid to late weeks to balance economic and social needs. The risk of imported infections is roughly proportional to the product of inbound flow, traffic fraction, and infected proportion (Flow * ft * (I / population)), guiding the temporal distribution of traffic. This temporal reallocation helps flatten importation peaks and reduces cumulative epidemic pressure in Tennessee. The trade-off between epidemic control and mobility is managed by not reducing total inbound flow but shifting it to weeks with lower infection pressure, thus maintaining essential mobility and economic activity. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls would be even more beneficial, while lower prevalence could allow more relaxed policies. These allocations also assume consistent epidemic dynamics and mobility patterns; sudden changes in local outbreaks or variants could require policy re-adjustment. Overall, this multi-state cooperative approach balances risk and mobility to reduce COVID-19 impact effectively in Tennessee."

    "notes": "Alabama shows a moderate infected population (I=500) relative to its total population (~4.83M). The exposed (E=1603) and infected (I=500) groups indicate a persistent risk of importing infections. Given the very high average daily inflow (100783.5), the imported infected count roughly estimates as Flow*ft*(I/S+E+I+Q+R+D), but simplified as Flow*ft*(I/population) shows infection pressure is significant. The traffic control pattern chosen is relaxed-first, gradually increasing fractions over the four weeks (0.20 to 0.30). This approach leverages the assumed epidemic decline in Alabama (due to intervention or natural dynamics) allowing safer relaxation over time while maintaining a strict start to prevent early importation spikes. The trade-off balances epidemic control by initially strict control and economic/mobility benefits by increasing flow later. The fractions sum to exactly 1.000, validating allocation consistency."

The average daily inflow is moderate (5467.32), suggesting smaller imported infection pressure. Given the relatively stable infection levels, an even distribution pattern across the four weeks is chosen to maintain balanced control without strong fluctuations that might lead to surge risks. The imported infections relate to Flow*ft*(I/population), which remains moderate given inflow. Balancing control and mobility evenly reduces sudden epidemic risks and supports consistent economic activity. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000, confirming valid distribution."

Average daily inflow is moderately high (36410.5). The imported infections estimate as Flow*ft*(I/population) which is significant. We adopt a strict-first pattern with higher control early (lower fractions) to mitigate early imported cases, then relaxed control later as local epidemic may stabilize.

The daily inflow is low (1607.96), so imported infection numbers are moderate. A strict-first pattern is chosen: initially limiting traffic more (higher control, lower fractions in first weeks), then gradually relaxing. This reduces initial infection importation risk when Idaho's prevalence is high, while later weeks allow some mobility increase as local cases may decrease.

  "global_guidance": "The traffic control policy across origin states is designed to collectively minimize imported infections and deaths in Tennessee by balancing epidemic risk and mobility. States with high infection prevalence (high I and E) and substantial inflow are controlled more strictly in early weeks (strict-first pattern) to limit initial importation risk, while states with lower infection prevalence or stable epidemics use relaxed-first or even patterns to gradually restore mobility. This temporal distribution of traffic fractions helps flatten potential infection spikes by not allowing all inflows to peak simultaneously, effectively balancing load on Tennessee's healthcare and containment capacity. Quantitatively, imported infected cases roughly scale with Flow*ft*(I/population), so adjusting fractions ft shifts infection importation across weeks. By synchronizing stricter controls in weeks when origin states have higher prevalence, and relaxing when prevalence declines, the approach reduces cumulative cases and deaths. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter initial controls would become more critical to prevent importation surges. Conversely, if prevalence wanes faster, relaxation can accelerate. Overall, this cooperative allocation across origin states and weeks strategically manages epidemic risk while permitting gradual mobility recovery, optimizing health and economic outcomes."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations collectively aim to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Tennessee by balancing epidemic control and mobility across all origin states and weeks. We use the risk interpretation from SEIQRD parameters, focusing on the infected (I) and exposed (E) compartments relative to population size to assess infection pressure. Importation risk is roughly proportional to the product of inbound flow, weekly traffic fraction, and infection prevalence (I/pop). By distributing traffic fractions across four weeks with patterns (even, strict-first, relaxed-first, or strict-relaxed-strict), we mitigate sudden surges in imported infections while preserving essential mobility and economic activity. Strict-first patterns reduce early infection pressure when imported cases could seed local outbreaks, while relaxed-first patterns allow more mobility initially but tighten control later to prevent cumulative excess infections. Even patterns are used where infection pressure is moderate and stable, maintaining steady mobility and control. Trade-offs involve balancing epidemic risk (lower fractions reduce risk but restrict mobility) against social and economic needs. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls (lower initial fractions) become more critical to prevent exponential growth. Conversely, if prevalence declines or beta reduces, more relaxed traffic can be permissible without significant risk. Cooperation among origin states is implicit in coordinating traffic patterns to smooth imported infection risk over time and origins, preventing local healthcare overload. The exact sum of fractions to one per origin ensures total inbound flow remains constant over four weeks, meeting the constraint. This approach provides a data-driven, nuanced policy to minimize Tennessee's epidemic burden while supporting mobility."

For states with low or moderate prevalence but large inflow, an even distribution avoids spikes in weekly imported infections. This coordinated approach balances epidemic suppression and economic/social mobility by keeping total inbound flow constant while redistributing weekly proportions. Quantitatively, imported infections roughly scale with Flow*ft*(I/Population), so lowering ft in early weeks for high-risk states reduces the initial infection pressure, flattening the epidemic curve in Tennessee. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls become more critical. Conversely, lower prevalence or effective local control may allow more relaxed schedules. Cross-state cooperation by balancing weekly allocations prevents overwhelming Tennessee's health system with imported cases, helping contain spread without overly restricting mobility. This strategy is adaptive and can be recalibrated as epidemic parameters evolve."

The infection prevalence (I/population) is low (~0.022%). The daily inbound flow to Tennessee is large (92,152). Imported infected cases can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/population), so higher flows in weeks with higher prevalence increase risk. Given that Alabama's epidemic indicators are relatively stable but with some confirmed cases, a slightly strict-first pattern (lower f1, gradually relaxed) is chosen to reduce immediate importation risk but allow some mobility later as the epidemic stabilizes. This balances epidemic control with economic activity. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.20+0.25+0.30+0.25=1.0)."

  "global_guidance": "The traffic control policy balances epidemic control and mobility by modulating weekly inbound flow fractions to Tennessee from each origin state while keeping total 4-week flow constant. States with higher infection prevalence (I/population) or exposed counts relative to susceptible population receive stricter control early (lower fractions in week 1), reducing importation of infected individuals who can seed local transmission and increase confirmed and deceased cases. For example, Idaho, Utah, and Michigan show higher infection pressure and thus have strict-first patterns with low initial flow fractions. Conversely, states with low prevalence and stable epidemic situations have either even or mildly strict-first patterns, balancing control and economic activity. The pattern choice reflects the temporal distribution of risk: strict-first reduces risk of early importation and outbreak seeding; relaxed-first would risk early seeding and is avoided here. Even distributions smooth risk and mobility evenly. The fractions sum exactly to 1 for all states, ensuring total flow remains constant. Cross-state coordination is critical: by collectively reducing early inbound flows from high-risk states, Tennessee minimizes imported infections and downstream cases. Weekly balancing distributes traffic to avoid overwhelming local control capacities. Sensitivity analyses show that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls become more critical to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence falls or vaccination improves, gradual relaxation can be accelerated. This approach integrates epidemiological data with mobility to optimize disease control and economic sustainability."

States with higher infection prevalence (I/population) or exposed counts relative to susceptible population receive stricter control early (lower fractions in week 1), reducing importation of infected individuals who can seed local transmission and increase confirmed and deceased cases. For example, Idaho, Utah, and Michigan show higher infection pressure and thus have strict-first patterns with low initial flow fractions. Conversely, states with low prevalence and stable epidemic situations have either even or mildly strict-first patterns, balancing control and economic activity. The pattern choice reflects the temporal distribution of risk: strict-first reduces risk of early importation and outbreak seeding; relaxed-first would risk early seeding and is avoided here. Even distributions smooth risk and mobility evenly. The fractions sum exactly to 1 for all states, ensuring total flow remains constant. Cross-state coordination is critical: by collectively reducing early inbound flows from high-risk states, Tennessee minimizes imported infections and downstream cases. Weekly balancing distributes traffic to avoid overwhelming local control capacities. Sensitivity analyses show that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls become more critical to prevent outbreaks. Conversely, if prevalence falls or vaccination improves, gradual relaxation can be accelerated. This approach integrates epidemiological data with mobility to optimize disease control and economic sustainability.'
