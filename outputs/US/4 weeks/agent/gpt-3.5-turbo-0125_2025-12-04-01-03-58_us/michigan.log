The infected proportion is relatively low compared to the population, indicating moderate risk. Imported infected cases can be approximated as Flow*f_t*(I/S), so shifting more flow to later weeks (30% in week 3) helps reduce early infection importation when Michigan's infection is still high. The chosen pattern is relaxed-first, allowing some early mobility but increasing control later to mitigate cumulative risk. This balances epidemic control and mobility by not overly restricting early traffic but tightening later as Michigan continues to manage its own cases. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

The infected proportion is somewhat higher than Alabama's, suggesting a slightly higher importation risk. Using the formula Flow*f_t*(I/S), spreading the flow more towards weeks 3 and 4 (60% total) helps delay the peak importation risk, aligning with Michigan's epidemic curve to minimize imported infections. The relaxed-first pattern suits the moderate infection pressure of Arizona, enabling some early movement but increasing control in the early weeks. Trade-offs involve allowing economic and social mobility early on but reducing risk by stricter control mid-period. Fractions sum to 1.000 exactly."

The expected imported infected is proportional to Flow*f_t*(I/S), so stricter early control is justified. The pattern is relaxed-first, with lower fraction in week 1 (15%) and increasing in weeks 3 and 4, reflecting managing risk by delaying some flow.

    "notes": "Wisconsin has moderate infected (1,677) and exposed (2,211) with susceptible (5,812,647) and very high inbound flow (28,946). Early strict control is needed to reduce importation risk. The relaxed-first pattern shifts flow to later weeks to minimize Michigan's early exposure, balancing control and mobility. Fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "The collective strategy across all origin states is to prioritize stricter traffic control in the earlier weeks (weeks 1 and 2) and gradually relax restrictions in weeks 3 and 4. This relaxed-first pattern is based on the epidemic dynamics in Michigan and the origin states. Michigan currently has a notable infected and confirmed population, and imported infections early can exacerbate local spread. By reducing inbound flow fractions early, the cumulative imported infection pressure is minimized when Michigan's susceptible population is still vulnerable. The total inbound flow per origin state remains constant, preserving long-term mobility, but shifting timing reduces peak importation risks. Quantitatively, imported infections scale with the product of inbound flow, traffic fraction per week, and the infected proportion in the origin state (Flow*f_t*(I/S)). States with higher infected proportions or higher inbound flows receive stricter early week control fractions to reduce risk. Lower risk or lower flow states have more balanced or slightly relaxed distributions. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early control fractions become more critical to prevent surges. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more balanced or even distributions might be optimal. This coordinated cross-state temporal allocation effectively flattens the imported infection curve, helping Michigan reduce cumulative confirmed cases and deaths while maintaining necessary mobility over the month."

Given the average daily inflow of 8479, the imported infected can be roughly estimated as Flow*ft*(I/S). To minimize disease importation, a strict-first pattern is chosen, allocating lower fractions in early weeks to reduce immediate importation of infectious individuals and relaxing control later as local Michigan infection prevalence may shift. This balances epidemic control by decreasing early imported cases while maintaining some travel flow later for economic considerations. The fractions sum to exactly 1, validating the distribution."

  "global_guidance": "The inbound traffic allocations across all origin states prioritize reducing early importation of infected and exposed individuals into Michigan, where the epidemic is ongoing with significant infected (I=4211) and exposed (E=4317) individuals. Applying strict controls in the initial weeks lowers the risk of seeding new infections while allowing gradual relaxation later to balance economic and social mobility demands. This pattern is particularly critical for states with high infection prevalence and large daily inflows (e.g., Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin), where even minor reductions in early flow fractions substantially reduce imported infections due to the formula imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/S). Conversely, states with lower inflow or infection prevalence adopt more balanced or even distributions to avoid unnecessary economic disruption. The coordination ensures that the total inbound flow over the 4 weeks remains constant per state, preserving transportation needs but redistributing timing to minimize epidemic impact. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls would yield greater reductions in cumulative cases. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed allocations may be justified. This cooperative, flexible approach reduces cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by controlling importation timing, flattening the epidemic curve in Michigan, and balancing public health with economic mobility."

    "notes": "Alabama shows moderate exposed (E=1360) and infected (I=426) relative to its susceptible population (S=4,856,818). The imported infected cases are roughly proportional to Flow * ft * (I / population), indicating that high traffic weeks will import higher infection risk. Since Alabama has a moderate infection level, a strict-first pattern is recommended to front-load restrictions when importation risk is highest to prevent seeding outbreaks in Michigan. The fraction sums to 1 exactly (0.40+0.30+0.20+0.10=1). Balancing epidemic control and mobility, stricter early weeks reduce immediate risk, while relaxing later weeks allows some mobility recovery."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce expected imported infections and deaths in Michigan, the traffic control policy prioritizes stricter controls in early weeks for origin states with higher infection prevalence (I) and larger mobility flows. By front-loading restrictions (strict-first pattern) for states like Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, Alabama, and Kentucky, the policy reduces the initial seeding risk, preventing early outbreaks in Michigan. States with stable or increasing infection pressure but lower current prevalence, such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah, are assigned relaxed-first patterns, allowing mobility early but tightening later to mitigate rising risks. States with low infection prevalence and moderate flows, like Nebraska, Idaho, and South Carolina, have even flow distributions to balance control with economic activity. The quantitative cooperation logic balances importation risk across weeks and states by adjusting weekly fractions so that the total flow remains constant but the timing shifts. This temporal redistribution reduces cumulative infection introductions during peak infectious periods. Sensitivity considerations include that if prevalence increases in some states or transmission rates (beta) rise, more stringent early restrictions are warranted. Conversely, if prevalence or beta decreases, flow fractions can be more evenly distributed or relaxed. The approach is robust to such changes by prioritizing early risk mitigation and gradual relaxation, minimizing Michigan's cumulative confirmed and deceased cases effectively."

The infection pressure, estimated as I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D), is low but not negligible. Imported infections roughly scale with Flow * ft * (I/Population). Given the moderate infection prevalence and significant inbound flow to Michigan (6778 daily), an even distribution pattern is chosen to balance mobility and epidemic control evenly over the 4 weeks. This avoids spikes in infection importation in any particular week. Trade-offs include maintaining consistent economic activity while preventing surges in imported cases.

Its susceptible population is relatively large (7,104,969). The inbound flow to Michigan is moderate (9804.25). Considering the slightly higher infected ratio in the first half of the period, a relaxed-first pattern is chosen to allow more flow early (f1=f2=0.3) and stricter control later (f3=f4=0.2) to reduce importation as prevalence may increase. This balances economic activity early with stricter controls as a precaution. The fractions sum to exactly 1 (0.3+0.3+0.2+0.2=1)."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound flow fractions collectively reduce expected imported infections and deaths in Michigan by strategically balancing early epidemic control with later mobility relaxation. States with higher infected and exposed prevalence, such as Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Tennessee, have stricter controls in the early weeks (lower ft) to reduce initial importation pressure, while states with lower infection burdens or smaller flows adopt more even or relaxed-first patterns to maintain economic activity. The total inbound flow over 4 weeks remains constant per state, but shifting weekly proportions to reduce flow during periods of higher epidemic risk allows Michigan to mitigate surges in imported cases. Quantitatively, imported infected cases can be approximated by Flow * ft * (I/population) per week; thus, lowering ft during high prevalence weeks reduces imported infections. This cross-state coordination ensures high-risk states contribute less flow initially, balancing overall importation risk. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls would become more critical, further reducing early-week ft values. Conversely, if prevalence declines, more relaxed patterns may be feasible. This approach optimizes the trade-off between maintaining essential mobility and minimizing epidemic impact by adaptively distributing inbound flow based on dynamic risk assessments."

    "notes": "Alabama shows a moderate number of infected individuals (I=715) relative to its large susceptible population (S=4,817,347). Given its past 28-day average inflow of 6,930.96, the expected imported infected can be roughly estimated as Flow*ft*(I/population), indicating that imported infections correlate directly with traffic flow fraction. Since Alabama's infection pressure appears stable without clear increasing or decreasing trends, an even weekly distribution (0.25 each) balances mobility and control. Stricter controls early might overly impact mobility without significant infection reduction benefits, and relaxed controls first might risk early seeding of cases. The total fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.25*4=1), complying with constraints. This balanced approach mitigates risk while maintaining consistent mobility."

    "notes": "Arizona's infection prevalence (I=1,401) and exposed (E=4,759) are notable in a population of 7,047,926, implying a moderate infection pressure. The daily average inflow is 14,617.39. Using the formula imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), lower traffic fractions in earlier weeks reduce early imported infections. Arizona's infection pressure is relatively high but may be trending downward, justifying a strict-first pattern (lower fractions early, higher later). This pattern prioritizes epidemic control initially when risks are higher and relaxes control as the situation improves, balancing economic and social mobility needs. The fractions sum to 1 precisely (0.15+0.20+0.30+0.35=1). This staggered easing reduces cumulative cases in Michigan."

    "notes": "Arkansas has a higher infection level (I=3,069) relative to its susceptible population (S=2,925,758), indicating elevated risk of importing infections with an average inflow of 4,385.57. Quantitatively, imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/population). Given this elevated risk, a strict-first pattern is advisable, with stronger traffic reduction in early weeks (0.30, 0.30) and relaxation in later weeks (0.20, 0.20). This reduces early imported infections when potential local transmission chains are most vulnerable. The sum of fractions equals 1 (0.3+0.3+0.2+0.2=1). This balances epidemic control with gradual restoration of mobility."

Using imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), early strict control reduces initial imported infections. Idaho's infection pressure suggests a strict-first pattern, starting with lower fractions (0.20) and increasing over time (to 0.30). This approach minimizes early seeding risk while allowing gradual mobility restoration. The fractions sum to 1 exactly. This balances risk and economic activity."

The average daily inflow to Michigan is very high at 118,287.36, making imported infections a significant concern. Given this, imported infections ~ Flow*ft*(I/population) suggest reducing early week traffic fractions to minimize immediate risk. A strict-first pattern (lower fractions weeks 1 and 2) is chosen, gradually relaxing controls later. This helps reduce cumulative cases and deaths by preventing early outbreak seeding. The fractions sum to 1 (0.18+0.22+0.30+0.30=1). This approach prioritizes epidemic control while allowing phased mobility restoration."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocation across origin states collectively aims to minimize Michigans cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by strategically varying weekly traffic fractions. States with higher infection prevalence (I) and exposure (E) relative to their population and significant inflows receive stricter control (lower fractions) in earlier weeks to suppress early seeding of imported infections. This strict-first pattern is predominant, as early control reduces exponential growth potential and cumulative cases. For states with lower infection pressure or stable trends, even distributions are chosen to balance epidemic control with mobility and economic needs. The logic follows imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), emphasizing that reducing ft in early weeks from high-risk states effectively lowers imported infections. Cross-state risk balancing is critical; the aggregate weekly inbound flow fraction sums to 1 per state, ensuring total inflow remains constant, preserving economic activity while optimizing timing. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence increases or transmission rate beta rises, stricter early controls yield greater benefits. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta falls, the pattern may shift toward more relaxed early weeks. This allocation scheme thus robustly navigates uncertainties, prioritizing epidemic control while enabling phased mobility for economic stability."

  "global_guidance": "To collectively reduce expected imported infections and deaths in Michigan, the inbound traffic allocations prioritize stricter controls in earlier weeks (strict-first) for states with higher infection prevalence and/or large inbound flows, such as Ohio, Texas, Indiana, and Arizona. This helps curb early imported infections when Michigan's epidemic is vulnerable to new case surges. States with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflows have more balanced or even allocations, maintaining mobility while controlling risk. The quantitative logic relies on the formula imported infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population), guiding allocation to reduce ft when infection prevalence or flow is high. The trade-off balances epidemic control (reducing imported cases and subsequent deaths) against mobility and economic activity needs. This temporal balancing mitigates infection spikes and maintains social functioning. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence rises or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls become more critical; conversely, lower prevalence allows more relaxed early allocations. The allocations sum exactly to 1 for each origin, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant over 4 weeks. This coordinated approach reduces cumulative confirmed and deceased cases by flattening the importation curve from multiple origins, distributing controls temporally to avoid overwhelming healthcare capacity in Michigan."

The exposed (E=3,404) and confirmed (Q=33,769) numbers are moderate. Given the daily average inbound flow of 7,595, the expected imported infections are proportional to Flow*ft*(I/Population). Since Alabama's infection pressure is stable and moderately low, an even pattern of inbound traffic allocation (f1=f2=f3=f4=0.25) is chosen. This evenly distributes imported infection risk across weeks while maintaining mobility, balancing epidemic control and economic activity. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocation prioritizes minimizing imported infections and cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Michigan by strategically modulating flow fractions from each origin state across the next four weeks. High-flow states with large infected and exposed populations (like Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, Texas) adopt a strict-first pattern, imposing stricter controls in later weeks to prevent sustained importation of infections while allowing some mobility early to reduce economic disruption. States with moderate infection pressure and flow have either even or relaxed-first patterns, balancing epidemic risk and mobility needs. The cumulative flow from each origin remains constant, preserving total inbound traffic volume while redistributing weekly fractions to optimize epidemic control. Quantitatively, imported infected cases are approximately proportional to Flow*ft*(I/Population), so lowering fractions in weeks with higher infection risks reduces cumulative case importation. Cross-state coordination ensures that risk is balanced temporally and spatially, preventing overburdening mobility restrictions in any single week or state. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter and earlier controls would be warranted, emphasizing the need for adaptive policies. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed allocations may be feasible.

High-flow states with large infected and exposed populations (like Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, Texas) adopt a strict-first pattern, imposing stricter controls in later weeks to prevent sustained importation of infections while allowing some mobility early to reduce economic disruption. States with moderate infection pressure and flow have either even or relaxed-first patterns, balancing epidemic risk and mobility needs. The cumulative flow from each origin remains constant, preserving total inbound traffic volume while redistributing weekly fractions to optimize epidemic control. Quantitatively, imported infected cases are approximately proportional to Flow*ft*(I/Population), so lowering fractions in weeks with higher infection risks reduces cumulative case importation. Cross-state coordination ensures that risk is balanced temporally and spatially, preventing overburdening mobility restrictions in any single week or state. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter and earlier controls would be warranted, emphasizing the need for adaptive policies. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, more relaxed allocations may be feasible. Overall, the approach balances epidemic control with mobility preservation, aiming to minimize cumulative disease burden in Michigan over the upcoming month.'
