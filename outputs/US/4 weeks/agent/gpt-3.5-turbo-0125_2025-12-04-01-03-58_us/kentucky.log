  "global_guidance": "The overall allocation strategy for Kentucky's inbound traffic balances epidemic control and economic mobility by adjusting weekly traffic fractions for each origin state based on their infection prevalence (I and E) and inflow volume. States with high infection pressure and large inflow (e.g., Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee) adopt mostly even or slightly relaxed-first patterns to avoid early spikes in imported cases while sustaining economic activity. States with very high infection prevalence but relatively lower inflow (e.g., South Carolina, Arkansas, Idaho) implement relaxed-first patterns to impose stricter control early, reducing imported infections when local epidemic risk is highest, then relaxing later as local conditions improve. The expected imported infections approximate to Flow*ft*(I/population), so reducing fractions in weeks with higher infection prevalence effectively lowers imported cases. This cross-state coordination minimizes cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Kentucky by smoothing importation pressure over time and across states, preventing healthcare system overload. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early-week controls and more pronounced relaxed-first patterns would be necessary. Conversely, if vaccination or other interventions reduce local or origin state prevalence, a more even or relaxed control pattern may suffice. This adaptive, data-driven approach ensures that Kentucky manages importation risks effectively while maintaining essential mobility and economic function."

The exposed (E=1499) and confirmed (Q=14982) also contribute to the risk. Imported infections can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)), highlighting that lowering flow fractions reduces imported infections.

  "global_guidance": "The collective traffic control policy for Kentucky's inbound flows balances epidemic risk and mobility by adjusting weekly flow fractions per origin state, while maintaining total inflow constant over 4 weeks. States with higher relative infection prevalence (I/population) and exposed counts are assigned stricter controls early (strict-first patterns) to reduce initial imported infections and subsequent local transmission risk. Conversely, states with moderate infection levels or very high flow volumes adopt even or relaxed-first patterns to balance epidemic control with economic and social mobility needs. The rationale is that early reduction of inbound flow from high-risk states delays and lowers the peak of imported infections, giving Kentucky's local health system time to respond and reducing cumulative cases and deaths. For states with lower infection pressure or large flow volumes, even or relaxed-first patterns maintain smoother mobility, preventing sudden economic shocks. Quantitatively, imported infections scale roughly as Flow * ft * (I / total population). Adjusting ft weekly redistributes risk, concentrating stricter controls when infection prevalence or local vulnerability is high. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls yield greater benefits by reducing early seeding events. Conversely, if prevalence is lower or beta decreases, more balanced or relaxed patterns minimize mobility disruption with acceptable risk. This coordinated approach ensures total flow remains constant per state while optimizing weekly distribution to minimize Kentucky's epidemic burden. The fractions per state sum exactly to 1, ensuring flow conservation and policy feasibility. The strategy reflects a data-driven, adaptive mobility control balancing public health and economic considerations."

    "notes": "Alabama's estimated infection prevalence, given E=1360 and I=426 over a population of about 6.2 million (sum of given compartments), is relatively low but non-negligible. Given its moderate infected count and high flow (32929 daily), the imported infections can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / total population). Allocating inbound traffic evenly over the 4 weeks (pattern: even) balances mobility and epidemic control, avoiding peaks in imported infections that could worsen Kentucky's epidemic. This steady approach minimizes sudden surges in cases while maintaining consistent travel. The sum of fractions is exactly 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "This traffic control policy for Kentucky carefully balances epidemic control and mobility by allocating inbound traffic fractions over four weeks from all origin states. States with high infection prevalence and large inbound flows, such as Indiana and Ohio, have stricter control early to reduce imported infections, then gradually relax traffic to support economic recovery. Low to moderate risk states have even or relaxed-first patterns to avoid harsh restrictions while managing risk. The mathematical logic is based on estimating the expected imported infected individuals as the product of inbound flow, fraction of traffic allowed, and infection prevalence (I/population). By spreading inbound traffic and enforced controls over time, we flatten potential surges of imported cases, minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Kentucky. Cross-state cooperation is implicit, as traffic reductions in high-risk states reduce overall epidemic pressure, while relaxed controls in lower-risk states sustain mobility. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter or earlier traffic controls would be necessary, while if prevalence decreases, more relaxed policies can be adopted. This approach preserves total inbound flow over 4 weeks, ensuring constant total mobility but redistributes it to minimize epidemic risk. All fractions sum exactly to 1, ensuring consistent traffic volumes. This policy aims to achieve optimal trade-offs between epidemic control and economic activity during the next month."

Lower prevalence states maintain even traffic allocation to sustain economic activity while mitigating importation risk. Quantitatively, imported infections scale with Flow * ft * (I / Population), so adjusting ft per week manages infection pressure. The distribution of traffic fractions summing to one per state ensures total inbound volume consistency, while temporal allocation mitigates risk peaks and allows adaptive response. Sensitivity analysis indicates if prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increase, stricter early controls would further reduce imported infections and deaths. Conversely, lower prevalence could allow more relaxed patterns. This cooperative strategy balances cross-state epidemic risks and mobility, reducing expected imported infections through temporal smoothing and targeted control, thus protecting Kentucky's public health while preserving essential travel and economic activity."

    "notes": "Alabama has a large susceptible population (4,834,585) with relatively low exposed (1,603) and infected (500) individuals. The infected fraction is quite low relative to the population, suggesting moderate infection pressure. The imported infected can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population), so distributing traffic evenly (even pattern) minimizes spikes in imported infections while maintaining steady mobility. Since Alabama's inbound flow is fairly large (about 13,500 daily), sudden relaxations could risk surges, so keeping traffic even is prudent. The sum of fractions is exactly 1. This balances epidemic control with economic activity by avoiding heavy restrictions that could disrupt mobility but still limits peak imported infections."

Infection pressure is higher, but the baseline inflow is low (about 2,639 daily). A relaxed-first pattern is chosen, allowing slightly stricter controls early to reduce immediate risk, then relaxing later to accommodate mobility needs. The imported infected is proportional to Flow * ft * (I / population). By lowering flow earlier, we reduce initial imported infections when risk is higher, then gradually relax to support mobility.

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy balances reducing immediate importation of infected individuals into Kentucky with maintaining essential mobility and economic activity. States with higher infection prevalence or exposed populations relative to their total populations are assigned stricter controls in the early weeks (strict-first pattern) to minimize initial disease importation. Conversely, some states with moderate prevalence and critical economic ties adopt relaxed-first or even patterns to support consistent mobility while balancing risk. The rationale for this approach is that imported infections are approximately proportional to Flow * ft * (I/population), so adjusting weekly fractions ft allows temporal redistribution of mobility to reduce peak infection importations that could overwhelm local control measures in Kentucky. By ensuring the sum of fractions equals exactly one per origin state, total traffic volume remains constant over the four weeks, preserving economic baselines but shifting timing to optimize epidemic control. This cooperative allocation across states minimizes cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Kentucky by flattening the infection importation curve over time and across sources. Sensitivity to changes in prevalence or transmission rate beta suggests that if infection prevalence rises or beta increases, stricter early restrictions become more important, while if prevalence or beta drops, mobility can be more evenly distributed. This adaptive control policy is robust to epidemic fluctuations and balances public health with mobility needs effectively."

The case prevalence is moderate, and the average daily inbound flow to Kentucky is significant (19440.9). The expected imported infected cases scale approximately with Flow*ft*(I/population), so maintaining a balanced distribution reduces risk spikes. The even pattern is chosen to distribute inbound flow equally across all four weeks, minimizing sudden peaks in imported infections that could overwhelm local control efforts. This balances epidemic control and mobility, preserving steady economic activity without overly restricting travel. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (1.0000), validating the allocation."

  "global_guidance": "Across all origin states, the traffic control policy aims to balance inbound flow over the next 4 weeks to minimize cumulative imported infections and deaths in Kentucky. States with very high infection prevalence and large inbound flow (e.g., Ohio, Indiana, Tennessee) are allocated flows either evenly or with relaxed-first patterns that start with stricter control early and gradually relax. This prevents early spikes in imported cases, allowing Kentucky's health system to manage load effectively. States with moderate or low infection prevalence and smaller flows often employ even traffic allocation to maintain consistent control and mobility balance. The quantitative logic relies on the formula imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population), guiding traffic fraction decisions based on infection prevalence and flow magnitude. By distributing flow fractions to avoid concentrated high-risk weeks, the policy reduces peak imported infections, lowering cumulative confirmed and deceased cases. This cooperative balancing across states mitigates risk spillovers and stabilizes epidemic dynamics in Kentucky. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) rises, stricter early control (lower initial fractions) would be warranted to avoid overwhelming local control. Conversely, reductions in prevalence allow more relaxed traffic patterns. The approach flexibly adapts to changing epidemiological conditions, balancing epidemic control and essential mobility to safeguard public health and economic vitality."

Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) rises, stricter early control (lower initial fractions) would be warranted to avoid overwhelming local control. Conversely, reductions in prevalence allow more relaxed traffic patterns. The approach flexibly adapts to changing epidemiological conditions, balancing epidemic control and essential mobility to safeguard public health and economic vitality."

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Kentucky, the inbound traffic allocations across origin states follow a strategic pattern balancing epidemic risk and mobility. States with higher infection prevalence (e.g., Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Tennessee, Wisconsin) adopt a relaxed-first pattern with stricter control in the initial weeks to reduce early imported infections, then gradually relax controls to support economic recovery. This temporal risk balancing helps flatten importation peaks and limits epidemic spread. States with moderate or low infection prevalence (e.g., Alabama, Iowa, South Carolina, Virginia) generally apply even traffic allocation to maintain stable mobility while controlling risk. The expected imported infected cases roughly scale with the product of daily inbound flow, weekly fraction, and infected proportion in the origin population (imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/population)). Thus, temporal modulation of ft effectively shapes importation pressure. Collectively, this coordinated approach ensures that cumulative inbound flow remains stable (fractions sum to 1 per state), preserving economic connectivity while reducing peak infection importation risk. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rate (beta) increases, stricter early controls with deeper reductions in initial weeks would be warranted to prevent surges. Conversely, lower prevalence or beta allows more relaxed patterns. This dynamic allocation provides flexibility to respond to evolving epidemic conditions in origin states, optimizing public health outcomes in Kentucky while balancing mobility and economic needs."

The exposed (E=3404) and confirmed (Q=33,769) numbers indicate ongoing transmission. Given the high inflow (13,692.57) into Kentucky, imported infections can be approximated as Flow*ft*(I/S). To minimize infections imported into Kentucky, we adopt a strict-first pattern with lower flow fractions in the initial two weeks (0.20, 0.25) to suppress early imported cases, then gradually relax controls in weeks 3 and 4 (0.30, 0.25) as the risk is expected to decrease or be better managed locally. This approach balances epidemic control and mobility by deferring more traffic once initial risk is mitigated. The fractions sum to exactly 1.00, ensuring total flow volume consistency."

The baseline inflow is low (3,230.96). Given this, an even traffic allocation across four weeks is reasonable to maintain mobility while not overly risking imported infections. The imported infected cases roughly equal Flow*ft*(I/S). An even pattern evenly distributes risk and benefits, avoiding sudden surges. This also simplifies logistics and public compliance.

The inflow is moderate (4,684.57). To reduce early importation risk, a strict-first pattern with low initial fraction (0.15) followed by gradual relaxation (0.25, 0.30, 0.30) is chosen.

We apply a strict-first pattern with very low initial fraction (0.10), increasing in later weeks (0.20, 0.35, 0.35) to minimize early risk and allow more mobility later.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies collectively focus on minimizing imported infections into Kentucky by adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions from each origin state according to their epidemic risk profiles and inflow volumes. States with higher infection prevalence (I/S) and larger inflows have stricter reductions in traffic in the initial weeks (strict-first pattern), deferring mobility to later weeks when local control measures and immunity might have improved, thereby reducing the cumulative epidemic burden in Kentucky. Conversely, states with moderate or low risk and low inflow adopt even traffic allocations to maintain stable mobility without significant additional epidemic risk. The key quantitative logic is that expected imported infections roughly scale with the product of inflow, weekly flow fraction, and the ratio of infected to susceptible population (Flow*ft*(I/S)). By modulating the fractions, we reduce the temporal overlap of peak inflows with peak infection prevalence, thus minimizing imported case seeding. This cooperative allocation across states balances epidemic control and economic mobility by spreading traffic flow over time and place, avoiding excessive restrictions on any single week or state. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if the transmission rate beta rises or infection prevalence changes, stricter early-week controls would be more beneficial to prevent exponential growth in Kentucky. Similarly, if prevalence drops or beta decreases, a more relaxed traffic pattern could be justified. These policies are designed with exact fraction sums of 1.00 per origin to maintain total flow volume consistency, ensuring logistical feasibility and compliance. Overall, these recommendations strategically reduce imported infections and deaths in Kentucky while preserving necessary mobility and economic activity."
