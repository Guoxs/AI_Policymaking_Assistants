  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policies prioritize reducing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Alabama by adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions from each origin state while keeping total 4-week inbound volume constant. States with high infected (I) and exposed (E) populations relative to their size, especially those with large daily inbound flows to Alabama (e.g., Mississippi, Tennessee, South Carolina), receive stricter early-week control (lower fractions in week 1 and 2) to minimize imported infections during critical periods when Alabama is vulnerable. This strict-first pattern aims to blunt initial waves of imported cases, reducing seeding of outbreaks. States with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflows have even or slightly relaxed-first patterns to balance mobility needs and epidemic control. The quantitative cooperation logic involves distributing importation risk over weeks and across states to avoid simultaneous high-risk flows. This temporal staggering reduces peak infection pressure within Alabama, allowing healthcare capacity to manage cases better. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter and more frontloaded controls become necessary to maintain control. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta is lower, more evenly distributed or relaxed allocations may suffice. Overall, these policies reduce imported infection pressure, flatten epidemic curves, and minimize deaths while preserving essential mobility. The exact sum-to-one constraint on weekly fractions ensures no net change in total inbound volume, maintaining economic and social connectivity within controlled epidemic risk bounds."

States with high infected (I) and exposed (E) populations relative to their size, especially those with large daily inbound flows to Alabama (e.g., Mississippi, Tennessee, South Carolina), receive stricter early-week control (lower fractions in week 1 and 2) to minimize imported infections during critical periods when Alabama is vulnerable. This strict-first pattern aims to blunt initial waves of imported cases, reducing seeding of outbreaks. States with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflows have even or slightly relaxed-first patterns to balance mobility needs and epidemic control. The quantitative cooperation logic involves distributing importation risk over weeks and across states to avoid simultaneous high-risk flows. This temporal staggering reduces peak infection pressure within Alabama, allowing healthcare capacity to manage cases better. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter and more frontloaded controls become necessary to maintain control. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta is lower, more evenly distributed or relaxed allocations may suffice. Overall, these policies reduce imported infection pressure, flatten epidemic curves, and minimize deaths while preserving essential mobility. The exact sum-to-one constraint on weekly fractions ensures no net change in total inbound volume, maintaining economic and social connectivity within controlled epidemic risk bounds.'

For states with lower infection prevalence or smaller inbound flows, even or relaxed-first patterns are adopted to maintain necessary mobility while managing epidemic risk. This cross-state approach balances the total inbound flows, ensuring the 4 weekly fractions sum to 1 per state, thereby preserving overall mobility at baseline levels while strategically timing restrictions. Quantitatively, imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/population), so shifting flow away from high-risk weeks reduces imported cases and subsequent transmission in Alabama. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls would be even more beneficial, while lower prevalence might allow more relaxed patterns with minimal epidemic impact. The recommendations thus provide adaptable, evidence-based traffic control schedules that minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Alabama by strategically timing mobility restrictions across origin states and weeks."

Spreading the inflow evenly minimizes spikes in imported infections while preserving consistent mobility. The sum of fractions is 1. This approach mitigates risks without excessive disruption."

    "notes": "Arkansas has a higher infection prevalence (I=1920) relative to its smaller population (~6.4 million) and a substantial average inflow (~8326 daily). The imported infection risk is significant early on. Thus, a strict-first pattern with stronger controls in the first two weeks (fractions 0.3,0.3) and relaxed later (0.2,0.2) is recommended. This reduces initial imported infections when the local epidemic is sensitive, allowing gradual relaxation later. Fractions sum to 1 exactly. This balances epidemic control and economic needs."

  "global_guidance": "The collective strategy focuses on minimizing imported infections into Alabama by modulating weekly inbound flows from each origin state according to their infection prevalence and inflow volumes. States with high infected counts and large inflows (e.g., Tennessee, Mississippi) are assigned a relaxed-first pattern to gradually increase flow, preventing sudden epidemic surges in Alabama. States with moderate to high prevalence but smaller inflows (e.g., Arkansas, Iowa, Utah) adopt strict-first patterns to limit initial pressure. Even distributions are used for states with moderate infection prevalence and inflow to maintain balanced risk and mobility. This cooperative pattern reduces cumulative imported infections and subsequent deaths by flattening the epidemic curve in Alabama, preventing healthcare overload. The total 4-week inflow volume remains constant per state, ensuring no loss of overall mobility but redistributing temporal risk. Sensitivity analysis indicates that increased infection prevalence or transmission rates would necessitate stricter early controls (lower fractions in early weeks) to prevent epidemic acceleration, while lower prevalence allows more balanced or relaxed patterns. This flexible, data-driven approach allows Alabama to manage imported infection risks effectively while preserving necessary mobility and economic activity."

    "notes": "Arizona has a large susceptible population (7,155,158) with moderate exposed (3,707) and infected (1,100) individuals, indicating ongoing transmission risk. The imported infected cases roughly scale with Flow * ft * (I / population), so controlling traffic in earlier weeks can significantly reduce imported infections. The pattern chosen is strict-first, with reduced traffic in the first two weeks (0.30 and 0.25), then gradually relaxing. This mitigates early seeding of infections to Alabama when Arizona's infection prevalence is relatively stable. Trade-offs involve balancing economic activity and epidemic control; strict early controls reduce risks but limit early mobility. The four fractions sum to exactly 1.00, ensuring flow preservation."

  "global_guidance": "The collective inbound traffic allocations prioritize early strict control for states with high infection prevalence and/or large flow into Alabama, such as Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Texas, to minimize early imported infections that can seed secondary outbreaks. The strict-first pattern reduces early seeding risk when epidemic pressure is high, then gradually relaxes to allow mobility recovery. States with lower infection prevalence or smaller inflows, such as Idaho, Iowa, Nebraska, and Utah, are assigned even traffic distributions to maintain steady mobility while managing risk proportionally. The expected imported infections scale approximately with Flow * ft * (I / population), so reducing ft in weeks where origin state prevalence is high yields significant reductions in imported cases. Cross-state cooperation is implicit in this allocation, as overall inbound flow remains constant per state, but temporal shifts reduce cumulative infection importation and deaths in Alabama. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates increase in any origin state, stricter early controls would be necessary to maintain low imported infections. Conversely, if transmission decreases, traffic could be more evenly distributed or relaxed earlier. The strategy balances epidemic control and mobility by focusing restrictions during peak risk periods and relaxing them as risk subsides, maintaining economic activity while protecting public health. Fractions for all states sum exactly to 1.000, preserving total flow and ensuring feasibility."

    "notes": "Arizona's average infected proportion (I/population) is moderate compared to other states, with 1228 infected out of approximately 12.3 million population. The imported infected cases can be approximated as Flow * ft * (I / population). Since the daily average inflow is 2656.36, the total infected import over 4 weeks is roughly proportional to this. Given the fairly stable infection rates and moderate exposure, an even distribution pattern (equal fractions 0.25 each week) is chosen to balance mobility and epidemic control. This avoids sudden influxes that could spike cases in Alabama and allows steady monitoring. The sum of fractions is exactly 1.000, ensuring flow conservation."

Since Arkansas's infection risk is relatively high but stable, a strict-first pattern is adopted with reduced inbound flow in week 1 (0.2 fraction) increasing in weeks 2 and 3 (0.3 fractions), then tapering off.

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Alabama, traffic control policies across all origin states are coordinated to reduce the immediate importation of infections while balancing mobility needs. We use estimated imported infected cases approximated as Flow * ft * (I/population). States with high infection prevalence and/or large inflow volumes (e.g., Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas) have stricter controls early (lower ft in week 1) to delay infection importation, allowing Alabama more time to manage current outbreaks. States with lower infection prevalence or inflow have more balanced or relaxed-first patterns to maintain economic and social connectivity without overwhelming Alabama's healthcare. The weekly fractions sum to 1 for each origin state, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant, preserving statistical consistency. This cooperation balances infection pressure across weeks and states, reducing peaks while smoothing inflow. Sensitivity analysis indicates if prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls (lower initial ft) are more beneficial to dampen case importation. Conversely, if prevalence decreases or beta reduces, more relaxed flows are sustainable. This dynamic approach allows Alabama to adapt traffic control policies based on evolving epidemic parameters, optimizing public health outcomes while preserving vital mobility."

The imported infected individuals roughly scale as Flow*ft*(I/Population), so with a moderate inflow of 3091/day, the risk is non-negligible. We adopt a strict-first pattern by reducing fractions in the first weeks (0.30, 0.25) to curb initial importation and then relaxing slightly as conditions stabilize. This pattern balances early epidemic control with later mobility. The fractions sum to exactly 1.00, validating allocation."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, these traffic allocations prioritize minimizing imported infections and deaths in Alabama by adjusting weekly flow fractions based on each origin state's infection prevalence and inflow magnitude. States with higher infected counts relative to population and larger inflows, such as Mississippi and Tennessee, are assigned stricter early-week controls to reduce initial importation risk, leveraging the fact that imported_infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/Population). Conversely, states with moderate or lower infection pressure and inflow adopt even or relaxed-first patterns to maintain essential mobility while controlling risk. This cross-state approach spreads epidemic control efforts over time and origins, preventing overwhelming Alabama's healthcare system and reducing cumulative cases. Quantitatively, balancing strict and relaxed weeks adjusts the temporal distribution of risk, allowing early suppression of importations while permitting later mobility for economic and social needs. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more critical, and the patterns here can be adapted to tighten early weeks further. Conversely, if prevalence declines, allocations can shift toward more relaxed patterns. This cooperative and adaptive strategy optimally balances epidemic control and mobility to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Alabama."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the inbound traffic allocation across all origin states aims to minimize the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Alabama by strategically shifting traffic flows to mitigate immediate importation risks. States exhibiting high infected (I) and exposed (E) populations, especially those with large inbound flows like Tennessee, Mississippi, and Ohio, receive stricter control (lower fractions) in the first week to reduce immediate epidemic pressure on Alabama's healthcare system. This strict-first pattern for high-risk states is balanced with relaxed-first or even patterns for states with moderate or low infection prevalence to maintain economic and social mobility. The quantitative logic underlying these choices hinges on the approximate formula for imported infections: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population), where reducing ft in weeks of high infection pressure directly lowers imported infections. By distributing inbound flow unevenly over the four weeks, the policy smooths the importation curve, preventing sudden spikes that could overwhelm local response capacity. The 4-fraction allocations for each state sum to exactly 1, preserving the total inbound flow over the month, thus maintaining overall mobility demand while controlling timing. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more critical, whereas lower prevalence allows more uniform traffic distribution.

States exhibiting high infected (I) and exposed (E) populations, especially those with large inbound flows like Tennessee, Mississippi, and Ohio, receive stricter control (lower fractions) in the first week to reduce immediate epidemic pressure on Alabama's healthcare system. This strict-first pattern for high-risk states is balanced with relaxed-first or even patterns for states with moderate or low infection prevalence to maintain economic and social mobility. The quantitative logic underlying these choices hinges on the approximate formula for imported infections: imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population), where reducing ft in weeks of high infection pressure directly lowers imported infections. By distributing inbound flow unevenly over the four weeks, the policy smooths the importation curve, preventing sudden spikes that could overwhelm local response capacity. The 4-fraction allocations for each state sum to exactly 1, preserving the total inbound flow over the month, thus maintaining overall mobility demand while controlling timing. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become more critical, whereas lower prevalence allows more uniform traffic distribution. This cooperative cross-state balancing of risk and mobility respects both public health imperatives and economic considerations, aiming for optimal epidemic control in Alabama."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations for Alabama from each origin state are designed to collectively minimize imported infections and subsequent transmission. States with higher infection prevalence and/or large inflows (e.g., Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, Arizona) receive stricter controls early (strict-first pattern) to reduce initial seeding of infections in Alabama. This frontloading of restrictions exploits the infectious period dynamics, cutting off early importation chains. Conversely, states with moderate or low prevalence and smaller inflows are assigned even or relaxed-first patterns, balancing mobility and epidemic control. The total inbound flow from each origin remains constant over the 4 weeks, preserving baseline mobility volumes but shifting timing to reduce epidemiological risk during peak transmission weeks. This inter-week risk balancing reduces overall expected imported infections and deaths by focusing controls when they are epidemiologically most impactful. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence increases in any origin state, stricter early restrictions should be intensified to preserve control. Similarly, if transmission parameters (e.g., beta) increase, stricter and earlier controls become more critical. Cooperative, staggered traffic control across states and weeks optimizes the trade-off between epidemic suppression and economic activity, mitigating overwhelming case surges in Alabama. The fractions for each state sum exactly to 1, ensuring flow conservation and policy feasibility."
