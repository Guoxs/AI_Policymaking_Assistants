The confirmed cases are high (14,562) but recovered (1,303) are low relative to susceptible. The risk of imported infections is roughly proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population). Since Alabama's infected population ratio is moderate, a balanced approach is warranted. We choose a relaxed-first pattern (increasing fractions over weeks) with f1=0.20, f2=0.25, f3=0.30, f4=0.25 to gradually relax traffic and avoid sudden spikes in imported infections. This pattern helps reduce early-week infection pressure while allowing increased mobility later. Trade-offs involve some early strict controls to protect Mississippi's low infected number (180) while supporting economic mobility later. The fractions sum exactly to 1.000."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations collectively prioritize early-week strict controls for origin states with high infected and exposed populations (e.g., South Carolina, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Idaho, Michigan) to reduce the number of imported infections into Mississippi during critical early weeks. States with lower infection pressure (e.g., Iowa, Nebraska) maintain more even distributions to support steady mobility without substantially increasing risk. The relaxed-first pattern is predominant, reflecting a strategic balance: limiting early imported infections to prevent epidemic acceleration in Mississippi while gradually reopening to minimize economic disruption. Quantitatively, imported infections approximate Flow*ft*(I/population), so adjusting weekly fractions ft modulates instantaneous infection import risk while conserving total volume. This cross-state cooperation reduces peak epidemic pressure, leveraging staggered relaxations across states rather than uniform policy, which could overwhelm healthcare capacity. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls or extended low fractions would be warranted to maintain epidemic control. Conversely, lower beta or prevalence allows more even or relaxed allocations. The proposed fractions sum precisely to 1 for each state, ensuring consistent total inbound flow. Overall, this policy aims to minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi by reducing imported infection seeds early while supporting mobility and economic resilience."

    "notes": "Alabama has a large susceptible population (4,869,397) with relatively low exposed (1,499) and infected (465) counts compared to its population. The infected fraction is I/population ~ 9.55e-5, low but not negligible. The expected imported infections scale with Flow*ft*(I/population). The average daily inflow is high (148,552), so even a small infected ratio poses a risk. Given stable infection levels and large flow, an even pattern is chosen to balance economic and mobility needs while controlling risk. Strict-first or relaxed-first is not justified due to no strong trend in infection changes. The fractions sum exactly to 1 (0.25*4=1). This allocation minimizes spikes by evenly distributing travel, maintaining moderate epidemic control without harsh weekly restrictions."

    "notes": "Arizona has a population of ~7.2 million with E=2,097 and I=632, infected fraction ~8.76e-5. The average daily inflow is low (2,604), so importation risk is moderate. The infection counts suggest some downward trend or control, so a relaxed-first pattern is used: allocate more traffic to earlier weeks (0.3,0.3) and reduce later weeks to minimize cumulative exposure. This reduces risk accumulation while preserving some mobility early. Fractions sum to 1. This trade-off balances epidemic control by front-loading travel when risk is manageable and tightening later when imported infections might spike."

  "arkansas": {
    "fractions": [0.20, 0.20, 0.30, 0.30],
    "notes": "Arkansas has higher infection levels relative to population (I=1,396 out of ~3M, ~4.65e-4 infected fraction) and large inflow (28,041). This is a higher risk source. A relaxed-first pattern is chosen to delay travel and reduce early imported infections. This means stricter controls initially (0.2) and relaxed later (0.3), assuming epidemic control improves over weeks or to avoid overwhelming health systems early. The fractions sum to 1. This approach carefully manages the trade-off by suppressing early traffic from a high-risk state and permitting some recovery later."

    "notes": "Idaho's infected proportion is higher (I=1,748 from ~1.77M, ~9.87e-4), and inflow is low (786). Given elevated infection pressure, a strict-first pattern is chosen, reducing early traffic to minimize imported infections when risk is highest, then gradually relaxing (0.15 to 0.35). This reduces initial seeding events in Mississippi. Fractions sum to 1. The trade-off here favors epidemic control with careful mobility restoration."

    "notes": "Indiana has a population ~6.7M and I=2,909 (4.34e-4 infected fraction) with moderate inflow (4,114). Infection levels are steady; no strong trend suggests even allocation to balance control and mobility. Imported infections ~ Flow*ft*(I/population) justify equal fractions.

    "notes": "Iowa's infected fraction is low (~3.6e-5) with inflow 2,197. Slightly higher fractions early (0.30) and reduced later reflect a relaxed-first pattern to harness low risk early and tighten later to preempt potential rises. Fractions sum to 1. This balances epidemic and mobility trade-offs given low infection pressure."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic control policies for Mississippi collectively aim to minimize imported infections and subsequent epidemic growth by balancing weekly traffic allocations across origin states based on their infection prevalence and traffic volume. States with higher infected proportions relative to their populations and substantial inflows, such as Arkansas, Idaho, Michigan, New Mexico, and Utah, adopt a strict-first pattern with reduced traffic in early weeks to mitigate early seeding of new infections. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or stable epidemic conditions tend to have either even or relaxed-first patterns, allowing some relaxation of traffic restrictions initially and tighter control later to balance epidemic control and economic needs. This cooperative approach leverages quantitative risk estimation: imported infected cases scale approximately with the product of daily inflow, weekly fraction, and infected proportion (Flow*ft*(I/population)). By distributing traffic volumes dynamically over four weeks, the strategy prevents concentration of imported infections that could overwhelm local health systems. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence rises or transmission rates (beta) increase in origin states, stricter early-week controls should be prioritized to suppress imported cases. Conversely, if prevalence decreases, traffic can be more evenly or front-loaded to support mobility. This adaptive multi-state coordination reduces cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi by preventing import-driven spikes while maintaining essential mobility. The exact fractions for each state sum precisely to 1, ensuring the total inbound traffic over 4 weeks remains consistent with ground truth data. This careful balance between epidemic risk and mobility preserves public health and economic stability."

The estimated imported infections are proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population). Given Alabama's large inflow (145125 daily average), any relaxation could increase imported infections substantially. Therefore, an even pattern is chosen to balance mobility and epidemic control. This evenly distributed flow minimizes sudden spikes in imported infections while maintaining necessary mobility.

The imported infection risk is proportional to the product of inflow, fraction allocated for the week (ft), and the infected fraction (I/population) of the origin state. States with higher infected and exposed populations and larger inflows are assigned stricter controls initially (strict-first pattern), reducing the fraction of inbound mobility in the early weeks to limit early importation of infections.

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocations across all 19 origin states strategically balance epidemic control and mobility optimization for Mississippi. States with high infection prevalence (I and E) and large inbound flows, such as Tennessee, Arkansas, Michigan, Oklahoma, and Ohio, are prioritized with stricter controls during early weeks (strict-first pattern) to minimize imported infections when risk is highest. Conversely, states with moderate or low infection pressure and lower flows, such as Alabama, Iowa, South Carolina, and Virginia, receive even or relaxed-first allocations to sustain economic and social mobility while maintaining control. The quantitative logic underpinning these allocations considers that imported infections approximately scale with the infected fraction (I/population) multiplied by the inflow and weekly fraction, thus reducing early-week fractions for high-risk states sharply limits imported infections. The pattern choices (strict-first, relaxed-first, even) reflect infection pressure trends and economic considerations, aiming to flatten the imported infection curve over time. The fractions sum to exactly 1 per state, ensuring the total inbound flow remains constant over 4 weeks. Cross-state coordination ensures the aggregate imported infection risk into Mississippi is minimized, particularly by front-loading restrictions in high-risk states and smoothing traffic from lower-risk origins. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early-week reductions become more critical. Conversely, if prevalence drops or beta decreases, more relaxed allocations might be feasible. These allocations provide a robust, adaptive framework to mitigate disease spread through targeted mobility controls while preserving essential traffic volumes and economic activity."

    "notes": "Alabama has a large susceptible population (4,834,585) relative to exposed (1,603) and infected (500), with a total population around 4.85 million. The infected fraction is low (~0.01%), but due to the very high average daily inbound flow to Mississippi (98,314), the expected imported infections can be approximated by Flow*ft*(I/Population). To reduce infections imported early on, we adopt a strict-first pattern, allocating lower fractions in earlier weeks (0.30, 0.25) and gradually relaxing control later (0.25, 0.20). This aligns with the infection pressure being moderate but with high mobility. The trade-off balances reducing immediate infection influx while allowing some mobility to limit socioeconomic disruption. The fractions sum to exactly 1, validating the distribution."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic policies for Mississippi collectively aim to minimize imported infections and consequent cases and deaths by balancing infection pressure from origin states and their mobility contributions. States with very high inbound flows and moderate to high infected proportions (e.g., Tennessee, Alabama, Texas, Ohio) adopt strict-first patterns to frontload control and reduce early importation of cases, which is critical to prevent exponential growth inside Mississippi. Conversely, states with low inbound flows or lower infection prevalence (e.g., Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin) use even or relaxed-first patterns to balance control and maintain socioeconomic activities. Quantitatively, the expected imported infected cases from each state over 4 weeks are proportional to the product of inbound flow, weekly fraction, and infected fraction (I/population). By concentrating control in early weeks where it most effectively reduces secondary transmission chains, the policies aim to reduce cumulative infections and deaths. Cross-state risk balancing ensures that no single week is overwhelmed by high inflows from multiple high-risk states, mitigating simultaneous importation peaks. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter early-week controls become more valuable, while lower prevalence allows more balanced or relaxed policies. The sum of fractions per state is rigorously maintained at exactly 1, ensuring total inbound flow is conserved while temporal distribution is optimized. Overall, this coordinated, data-driven approach leverages epidemiological insights and mobility patterns to protect Mississippi's public health while permitting essential travel."

  "global_guidance": "The overall traffic control strategy for inbound flows to Mississippi balances epidemic control with mobility needs by adjusting weekly fractions per origin state based on their infection pressure (I and E) relative to population. States with higher infection prevalence such as Michigan, Utah, and Arkansas adopt strict-first patterns, reducing early inbound flows to minimize initial seeding events that could trigger outbreaks in Mississippi. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or more stable trends like Alabama, Iowa, and Virginia apply even traffic allocation to maintain consistent mobility while controlling risk. Some states with moderate infection levels and economic importance, like Texas and Arizona, use relaxed-first patterns, allowing higher mobility early but tightening controls later to prevent late-stage importation and cumulative outbreak. The total inbound volume from each origin remains constant over four weeks to preserve economic and social flow demands. The weekly traffic fractions sum precisely to 1 for each state, ensuring no net change in total inflow but redistribution over time. This cooperative cross-state balancing mitigates importation risk more effectively than uniform or static controls. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) increases, stricter early control fractions should be favored to prevent exponential growth in Mississippi. Conversely, if local epidemic conditions improve or vaccination rises, traffic controls could be relaxed more evenly. This adaptive, data-driven allocation helps minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi while sustaining essential mobility."

Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or more stable trends like Alabama, Iowa, and Virginia apply even traffic allocation to maintain consistent mobility while controlling risk. Some states with moderate infection levels and economic importance, like Texas and Arizona, use relaxed-first patterns, allowing higher mobility early but tightening controls later to prevent late-stage importation and cumulative outbreak. The total inbound volume from each origin remains constant over four weeks to preserve economic and social flow demands. The weekly traffic fractions sum precisely to 1 for each state, ensuring no net change in total inflow but redistribution over time. This cooperative cross-state balancing mitigates importation risk more effectively than uniform or static controls. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmissibility (beta) increases, stricter early control fractions should be favored to prevent exponential growth in Mississippi. Conversely, if local epidemic conditions improve or vaccination rises, traffic controls could be relaxed more evenly. This adaptive, data-driven allocation helps minimize cumulative confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi while sustaining essential mobility.'

  "global_guidance": "The recommended traffic control policy for Mississippi strategically staggers inbound traffic across four weeks from each origin state, balancing epidemic control and mobility needs. By analyzing each state's infection pressure, considering the ratio of infected and exposed individuals to susceptible population, we estimate the risk of imported infections roughly proportional to daily inflow multiplied by the infected fraction and control fraction (Flow*ft*(I/S)). States with higher immediate infection pressure (e.g., Arkansas, Tennessee) are assigned stricter restrictions in the initial weeks (strict-first pattern) to prevent early seeding of infections in Mississippi. Conversely, states with infection pressure that may peak later (e.g., Idaho, Utah) adopt a relaxed-first pattern, allowing early mobility but tightening controls later to prevent late-stage importation. This week-by-week balancing reduces cumulative imported infections and deaths by minimizing temporal overlap of high-risk flows with Mississippi's vulnerable periods. The total fractions per state sum exactly to one, preserving total traffic volume while redistributing weekly flow for epidemic optimization. Sensitivity analyses indicate that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter front-loading of controls yields better outcomes by suppressing early importation. Conversely, if infection prevalence declines or vaccination coverage improves, more balanced or relaxed patterns may suffice. Cross-state cooperation is implicit; controlling high-risk origin states early reduces overall imported cases, enabling moderate relaxation for lower-risk states, thus optimizing both public health and economic activity. This policy aligns with Mississippi's SEIQRD parameters and current population composition, aiming to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases while maintaining essential mobility."

The imported infected cases can be approximated as imported_infected ~ Flow * ft * (I / population), where Flow is the inbound flow and ft the weekly fraction. Given that Alabama's infected fraction is low relative to its population, a strict-first pattern is chosen to frontload restrictions, minimizing the initial importation of infections. This approach reduces immediate pressure on Mississippi's healthcare system and buys time for local interventions. The trade-off is reduced mobility in the early weeks, impacting economic and social activities, but this is justified by the epidemic control benefits.

Allocating larger restrictions early reduces immediate risk and spreads out flow over time. The pattern is strict-first, balancing epidemic control with the need to maintain some mobility later.

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy balances epidemic control and mobility by adjusting weekly inbound flow fractions for each origin state based on their infection prevalence and inbound flow volume. States with high infection rates and/or large inbound flows (e.g., Tennessee, Alabama, Arkansas) use a strict-first pattern, imposing stricter controls early to reduce initial imported infections, which helps prevent overwhelming Mississippi's healthcare system. Conversely, states with lower infection prevalence or smaller inbound flows (e.g., Idaho, Michigan, South Carolina) employ even or relaxed-first patterns, allowing steady or gradually increasing mobility to support economic and social activities while keeping infection risks manageable. The sum of fractions for each state is exactly 1, preserving total inbound flow over the 4 weeks. This coordinated approach minimizes cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by frontloading restrictions where risk is highest, while permitting gradual relaxation where appropriate, thus maintaining a balance between epidemic containment and maintaining necessary mobility. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter frontloading of controls would be more effective, while lower prevalence or transmission could allow more relaxed patterns. The model assumes proportionality between imported infections and inflow multiplied by infection prevalence, guiding allocation of restrictions. This cooperation across states and weeks ensures risk is spread over time, avoiding peaks in imported infections and enabling Mississippi to better manage epidemic dynamics."
