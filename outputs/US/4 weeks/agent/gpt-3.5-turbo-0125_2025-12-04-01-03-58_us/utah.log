The risk of imported infections is proportional to the product of inbound flow and the infection prevalence (I/(S+E+I+Q+R+D)). Given Alabama's moderate infection pressure, we apply a 'strict-first' pattern to reduce flows initially and relax controls gradually as the epidemic may stabilize.

  "global_guidance": "To minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Utah, the traffic control policy collectively prioritizes stricter controls in the initial weeks for states with higher infection and exposure prevalence (e.g., Arkansas, South Carolina, Alabama) to reduce immediate importation risk. States with stable or lower infection pressures (e.g., Iowa, Minnesota, Texas) adopt even allocation patterns to balance epidemic control and economic mobility. The total inbound flow from each origin state remains constant, preserving essential mobility but shifting weekly proportions to reduce peak imported infections when the receiving state's epidemic is most vulnerable. This coordinated approach smooths infection importation over time, preventing sudden surges that could overwhelm local control measures. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections from a state are approximately proportional to the product of daily inbound flow, the weekly fraction, and the infected proportion in the origin state population. By front-loading stricter controls for high-risk states and relaxing later as local and imported infections hopefully decline, we mitigate seeding events and reduce secondary transmission in Utah. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates increase, stricter initial controls become even more critical, while lower prevalence allows more balanced or relaxed controls. Overall, the proposed allocations reflect epidemiological risk, mobility needs, and public health priorities to slow disease spread effectively."

States with stable or lower infection pressures (e.g., Iowa, Minnesota, Texas) adopt even allocation patterns to balance epidemic control and economic mobility. The total inbound flow from each origin state remains constant, preserving essential mobility but shifting weekly proportions to reduce peak imported infections when the receiving state's epidemic is most vulnerable. This coordinated approach smooths infection importation over time, preventing sudden surges that could overwhelm local control measures. Quantitatively, the expected imported infections from a state are approximately proportional to the product of daily inbound flow, the weekly fraction, and the infected proportion in the origin state population.

  "global_guidance": "The traffic control policy for Utah strategically balances epidemic control and mobility by adjusting weekly inbound traffic fractions from each origin state based on their infection prevalence (I and E) and daily inflow volumes. States with high infection prevalence and/or high inflow, such as Idaho and Arizona, receive stricter or evenly distributed control to mitigate large imported infection risks. States with lower infection prevalence or lower inflow adopt strict-first patterns to minimize early importation risk, gradually relaxing controls to allow economic activity. The approach collectively reduces the cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Utah by minimizing the overall pressure of imported infections in the critical initial weeks when seeding local outbreaks is most risky. The cooperation logic involves temporal redistribution of the constant total inbound flow per state, decreasing inflow fractions during high-risk weeks and compensating in lower-risk weeks, thereby smoothing epidemic pressure while maintaining total mobility. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rate beta increases, stricter early controls would be warranted, potentially shifting more weight to even stricter first-week reductions. Conversely, if beta or prevalence decreases, more relaxed patterns could be adopted to restore mobility. The proposed allocations ensure the sum of fractions per state is exactly 1, respecting the constraint of constant total flow over 4 weeks. This finely tuned policy supports epidemic mitigation in Utah while balancing essential economic and mobility considerations."

    "notes": "Alabama has a relatively low infection prevalence with I=426 out of a population of approximately 6.4 million (sum of S+E+I+Q+R+D), indicating low infection pressure. The imported infected can be roughly estimated as Flow*ft*(I/population). Given the low infection rate, we can allow somewhat relaxed control in initial weeks but increase restrictions later to avoid resurgence, following a strict-first pattern to curb any emerging spread. We allocate the fractions with stricter control in the last week to mitigate risk from potential incubation period delays. The sum of fractions is 1.00. This pattern balances mobility needs with epidemic control by gradually tightening controls, minimizing imported infections."

We adopt a relaxed-first pattern here since initial control can be moderate to support mobility, but we intensify restrictions in week 3, where the fraction is highest, to catch infections from earlier travel. This pattern helps balance economic activity initially while controlling spread over time. Fractions sum exactly to 1.00."

  "global_guidance": "Collectively, the recommended traffic control policies allocate inbound flows from origin states into Utah over the next four weeks in a way that balances minimizing imported infections while maintaining necessary mobility. States with higher infection prevalence or increasing infection trends adopt stricter controls in later weeks (strict-first pattern) to contain delayed infections and reduce cumulative cases and deaths in Utah. States with stable or low infection levels use even or relaxed-first patterns to support mobility with manageable risk. The logic relies on the proportional relationship of imported infected cases as Flow*ft*(I/population), where Flow is the baseline inbound flow and ft is the weekly fraction. By modulating ft across weeks, we reduce peak imported infections and smooth cumulative risk. This cooperative cross-state approach balances epidemic control and economic activity, avoiding simultaneous peak flows from multiple high-risk states. Sensitivity analysis suggests if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter controls earlier or longer may be needed, while lower prevalence allows more relaxed policies. These allocations are calibrated to sum exactly to 1 per state, preserving total inbound flow and ensuring feasibility. This coordinated mobility management reduces Utah's cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by limiting imported infections while maintaining essential travel and commerce."

  "global_guidance": "The recommended inbound traffic allocation across all origin states for Utah distributes the total inbound flow evenly or with patterns that reflect infection pressure trends to minimize cumulative infections and deaths. States with higher infected or exposed prevalence (e.g., Arkansas, Ohio, Tennessee) adopt a strict-first pattern with reduced traffic in early weeks to curb immediate importation risk, relaxing controls later to balance mobility and economic activity. States with lower or stable infection levels (e.g., Alabama, Iowa, Minnesota) use even allocations to maintain consistent flow and avoid disruptions. Large states with high populations and flow such as Arizona and Texas use relaxed-first patterns, progressively increasing flow in later weeks assuming control measures reduce prevalence. This cooperative balancing reduces peak imported infection pressure in Utah, smoothing the epidemic curve and preventing healthcare overload. Quantitatively, imported infected cases are proportional to Flow * ft * (I / population), so reducing ft in weeks with higher external prevalence mitigates risk. Sensitivity analysis shows that if prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls (lower f1 and f2) would be more beneficial, while lower prevalence allows more even or relaxed allocations. Overall, this policy harmonizes epidemic control with economic and social needs by adapting traffic flow timing per origin state's infection dynamics, ensuring total inbound flow remains constant to avoid unplanned mobility shifts."

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy balances infection risk and mobility across all origin states to minimize cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Utah. States with higher infection prevalence or larger inflows receive stricter early restrictions (strict-first pattern) to reduce importation of exposed and infected individuals, while states with lower prevalence or smaller inflow adopt even or relaxed-first patterns to sustain economic activity. The total inbound flow from each state over 4 weeks remains constant, preserving essential mobility but smoothing weekly proportions to avoid spikes in imported infections. Quantitatively, expected imported infections are proportional to Flow*ft*(I/population); hence reducing ft in early weeks for higher risk states reduces cumulative infections and deaths. The balance of relaxed restrictions in later weeks allows gradual resumption of movement once local outbreaks are controlled or population immunity improves. This cooperative allocation across states and weeks accounts for varying epidemic statuses, controlling inflow risk without overly harsh total restrictions. Sensitivity analysis suggests if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) rise, stricter early controls with possibly longer durations would be needed. Conversely, if prevalence falls or vaccination coverage increases, more relaxed allocations could be used to restore mobility. This policy thus dynamically balances epidemic control and mobility, minimizing Utah's epidemic burden while sustaining essential interstate connections."

The exposed (E=3,057) and confirmed (Q=30,257) are sizable but not alarming. The imported infected flow approximates as Flow*ft*(I/pop) with Flow=1084.68 and pop ~ 4.8M. The baseline inflow is moderate, so strict control early (week 1 fraction 0.30) followed by gradual relaxation reflects a 'strict-first' pattern to curb early imported cases when local Utah infections are moderate (I=11,877). This pattern helps flatten the curve by front-loading restrictions. Trade-offs balance necessary economic activity versus infection risk. The fractions sum exactly to 1.00."

The inflow is very large (25,145.75), thus risk of importing infected individuals is significant. Imported infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/pop), where pop ~ 13.1M. Given higher risk, a 'relaxed-first' pattern is chosen, starting with strict control (week 1 fraction 0.10), then easing restrictions gradually to allow economic activity while monitoring epidemic trends. This approach minimizes peak imported infections early on when local Utah infections are still high, then relaxes as local control improves. Trade-offs include some increased risk later offset by early suppression. Fractions sum precisely to 1.00."

Given this, an even distribution of traffic fractions is adopted to balance epidemic control and mobility. Even pattern avoids overburdening any single week with strict control and maintains steady risk management. Imported infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/pop), so spread evenly lowers risk fluctuations.

A 'strict-first' pattern is chosen to impose stricter traffic control early (week 1 fraction 0.20) to reduce imported infections when local Utah infections are still considerable, then moderate relaxation mid to late weeks to support mobility. Quantitatively, imported infected ~ Flow*ft*(I/pop) means lowering ft early reduces infections most effectively given epidemic dynamics. Trade-offs balance epidemic suppression with mobility needs.

  "global_guidance": "The overall strategy for Utah's inbound traffic control aims to minimize imported infections and deaths by adjusting weekly traffic fractions from each origin state while keeping total inbound flows constant. States with higher infected (I) counts and larger exposed (E) populations relative to their total population are assigned stricter controls earlier in the next 4 weeks ('strict-first' pattern). This front-loads epidemic suppression when Utah's local infections are still significant (I=11,877), lowering the risk of seeding new outbreaks that would increase total confirmed and deceased cases. Conversely, states with lower infection pressure or very high baseline inflow but moderate infection prevalence employ a 'relaxed-first' or 'even' pattern, gradually easing restrictions to balance epidemic control with economic mobility. Quantitatively, imported infections from state i are proportional to Flow_i * f_t * (I_i / pop_i), so lowering f_t in early weeks for high-risk states reduces immediate infection importation. Balancing these allocations across states and weeks leverages cooperation: strict early controls on high-risk states reduce importation pressure, allowing later relaxation and economic recovery without overwhelming Utah's health system. Sensitivity analysis shows that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early control fractions should increase to prevent exponential case growth. Conversely, if local Utah conditions improve markedly, controls can be relaxed earlier. This adaptive, data-driven approach optimizes epidemic mitigation and mobility, minimizing cumulative confirmed and deceased cases in Utah."

States with higher infection prevalence (e.g., Idaho, Wisconsin, Michigan) have stricter early-week restrictions (lower f1 and f2) to reduce initial importation risk when infectious pressure is highest. States with lower prevalence or stable infections adopt either even distributions or moderate early restrictions to balance mobility and epidemic control. The traffic allocation respects the constraint that total inbound flow over four weeks remains constant but shifts weekly proportions to delay or reduce early importation risks. Quantitatively, the risk of imported infections is proportional to Flow * ft * (I / population). By lowering ft in early weeks for high-risk states, the expected imported infections during those critical periods are minimized, thus reducing the probability of seeding outbreaks in Utah. This coordinated approach distributes risk temporally and spatially, preventing simultaneous peaks in imported cases that could overwhelm local health resources. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if infection prevalence or transmission rates (beta) increase, stricter early controls become even more critical to contain spread. Conversely, if prevalence falls or control measures improve, gradual relaxation can be accelerated. This dynamic, data-driven allocation balances public health priorities with economic and social mobility needs.
